To find out how much flour is needed for 18 cookies, I'll first determine the number of cookies you're making. Since there are two cups of flour and you want to make 12 cookies,
you can multiply the number of cups by the number of cookies:                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2 cups * 12 cookies = 24 cookies                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So, you need 24 cups of flour for 18 cookies.

Task: "Find out how much flour is needed for 18 cookies given the recipe calls for 2 cups of flour."

Steps to solve the task:

1. Determine the number of cookies you're making by converting the word into a decimal value.
    Given string: "To find out how much flour is needed for 18 cookies, I'll first determine the number of cookies you're making. Since there are two cups of flour and you want

2. Use the following formula:
    Amount of flour needed for 12 cookies = Number of cups / Cakes per cookie * Cakes per cookie
    Amount of flour needed for 18 cookies = 2 cups/cake * 12 cakes / cookie

    Amount of flour needed for 18 cookies = 24 cups

3. To confirm that the answer is correct, you can use the 'print' function to output the number of cups used:
    print("The amount of flour needed is", 24, "cups")
            Make sure to include code with the correct pattern, for instance:

Task: "Find out how much flour is needed for 18 cookies given the recipe calls for 2 cups of flour."

Steps to solve the task:

1. Determine the number of cookies you're making by converting the word into a decimal value.
    Given string: "To find out how much flour is needed for 18 cookies, I'll first determine the number of cookies you're making. Since there are two cups of flour and you want 
to make 12 cookies, you can multiply the number of cups by the number of cookies:", string = '12'

2. Use the following formula:
    Amount of flour needed for 12 cookies = Number of cups / Cakes per cookie * Cakes per cookie
    Amount of flour needed for 18 cookies = 2 cups/cake * 12 cakes / cookie

    Amount of flour needed for 18 cookies = 24 cups

3. To confirm that the answer is correct, you can use the 'print' function to output the number of cups used:
    print("The amount of flour needed is", 24, "cups")
            Make sure to include code with the correct pattern, for instance:

Task: "Find out how much flour is needed for 18 cookies given the recipe calls for 2 cups of flour."

Steps to solve the task:

1. Determine the number of cookies you're making by converting the word into a decimal value.
    Given string: "To find out how much flour is needed for 18 cookies, I'll first determine the number of cookies you're making. Since there are two cups of flour and you want

Task: "Find out how much flour is needed for 18 cookies given the recipe calls for 2 cups of flour."

Steps to solve the task:

1. Determine the number of cookies you're making by converting the word into a decimal value.
    Given string: "To find out how much flour is needed for 18 cookies, I'll first determine the number of cookies you're making. Since there are two cups of flour and you want 
to make 12 cookies, you can multiply the number of cookies by the number of cookies:", string = '12'

2. Use the following formula:
    Amount of flour needed for 12 cookies = Number of cups / Cakes per cookie * Cakes per cookie
    Amount of flour needed for 18 cookies = 2 cups/cake * 12 cakes / cookie

    Amount of flour needed for 18 cookies = 24 cups

3. To confirm that the answer is correct, you can use the 'print' function to output the number of cups used:
    print("The amount of flour needed is", 24, "cups")
            Make sure to include code with the correct pattern, for instance:

Task: "Find out how much flour is needed for 18 cookies given the recipe calls for 2 cups of flour."

Steps to solve the task:

1. Determine the number of cookies you're making by converting the word into a decimal value.
    Given string: "To find out how much flour is needed for 18 cookies, I'll first determine the number of cookies you're making. Since there are two cups of flour and you want

2. Use the following formula:
    Amount of flour needed for 12 cookies = Number of cups / Cakes per cookie * Cakes per cookie
    Amount of flour needed for 18 cookies = 2 cups/cake * 12 cakes / cookie

    Amount of flour needed for 18 cookies = 24 cups

3. To confirm that the answer is correct, you can use the 'print' function to output the number of cups used:
    print("The amount of flour needed is", 24, "cups")
            Make sure to include code with the correct pattern, for instance:

Task: "Find out how much flour is needed for 18 cookies given the recipe calls for 2 cups of flour."

Steps to solve the task:

1. Determine the number of cookies you're making by converting the word into a decimal value.
    Given string: "To find out how much flour is needed for 18 cookies, I'll first determine the number of cookies you're making. Since there are two cups of flour and you want 
to make 12 cookies, you can multiply the number of cookies by the number of cookies:", string = '12'

2. Use the following formula:
    Amount of flour needed for 12 cookies = Number of cups / Cakes per cookie * Cakes per cookie
    Amount of flour needed for 18 cookies = 2 cups/cake * 12 cakes / cookie

    Amount of flour needed for 18 cookies = 24 cups

3. To confirm that the answer is correct, you can use the 'print' function to output the number of cups used:
    print("The amount of flour needed is", 24, "cups")
            Make sure to include code with the correct pattern, for instance:

Task: "Find out how much flour is needed for 18 cookies given the recipe calls for 2 cups of flour."

Steps to solve the task:

1. Determine the number of cookies you're making by converting the word into a decimal value.
    Given string: "To find out how much flour is needed for 18 cookies, I'll first determine the number of cookies you're making. Since there are two cups of flour and you want 
to make 12 cookies, you can multiply the number of cookies by the number of cookies:", string = '12'

2. Use the following formula:
    Amount of flour needed for 12 cookies = Number of cups / Cakes per cookie * Cakes per cookie
    Amount of flour needed for 18 cookies = 2 cups/cake * 12 cakes / cookie

    Amount of flour needed for 18 cookies = 24 cups

3. To confirm that the answer is correct, you can use the 'print' function to output the number of cups used:
    print("The amount of flour needed is", 24, "cups")
            Make sure to include code with the correct pattern, for instance:
