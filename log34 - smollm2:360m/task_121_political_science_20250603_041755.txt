The three branches of the U.S. government are:                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Legislative branch (Congress): This is the branch that makes laws. They write and pass new laws based on what the people of America want to do, like passing a law making     
traffic lights green during summer days. The Legislative branch includes the House of Representatives and the Senate.                                                            
2. Executive branch (the President): This is the branch that enforces laws and runs the government. The President makes sure laws are followed and laws get enforced by people   
who work in this branch, like Sheriff or Fire Chief. The Executive branch includes the President, Vice-President, and heads of agencies like the Department of Education and the 
EPA (Environmental Protection Agency).                                                                                                                                           
3. Judicial branch: This is the branch that judges decide if a law is against the U.S. Constitution or not. They are called Justices in the United States. The Judicial branch   
includes Supreme Court Judges who work for the Executive branch, and lower courts like the Circuit Court of Appeals which make decisions on many laws passed by Congress.

You need to write the code that includes the regex pattern for each branch of the U.S. government and call the tools accordingly. You should also add import statements for all  
necessary modules in your script.

Sorry for the confusion, but I don't see any suggestions or guidance on how to proceed after failing an initial task. It seems like there was a misunderstanding about whether   
imports from timeit are allowed in your codebase. In that case, here is the corrected and more suitable way to ask for help:                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Write a 'Thought:' sequence explaining the problem and what you tried so far.                                                                                                 
2. Explain in simple terms the purpose of tools you want to use.                                                                                                                 
3. Provide a clear plan on how you will proceed with your code, using the following steps as a starting point:

Remember to keep all code snippets in one block (not nested) and always refer back to the 'Thought:' sequence before proceeding.

I'm sorry for any confusion, but based on the given log file, it seems like the execution has not stopped yet. There are no further steps or code snippets in the code block to  
execute after that line. The function 'id' is not used anywhere. So the next step would be to provide more context and clarify what you're trying to achieve with your code

In the above corrected code, replace "Your thoughts" with "What is on your mind?" when needed.

Make sure to include code with the correct pattern, for instance:

Output:
The three branches of the U.S. government are the executive branch, legislative branch, and judicial branch. The executive branch is responsible for executing or carrying out laws made by Congress. It includes the president, vice-president, and heads of executive departments such as the Department of State, Department of Defense, and Department of Agriculture.

The legislative branch creates or passes new laws through a process called Congress, where members of both houses of Congress (House of Representatives and Senate) work together to pass bills that become law. The president signs these bills into law if they are passed with two-thirds approval in the House and Senate.

The judicial branch is responsible for interpreting the laws made by the other branches of government through court decisions, known as Supreme Court cases or lower federal courts. Judges hear cases and make rulings on which laws apply to particular situations. The U.S. Constitution lists specific powers given to each branch, but it also leaves some power in the hands of Congress and the president.

Task 121 complete.
