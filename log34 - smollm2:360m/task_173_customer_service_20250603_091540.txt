I'd start by acknowledging their concern and expressing understanding that things can get complex. Then I'd clearly state the issue, using "We're disappointed" as a simple      
apology for the delay. Next I'd explain how we value our customers' business and strive to resolve issues quickly, without further explanation.                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The next part would be about providing more details on what happened - which could include timelines of events, steps taken to get the item resolved, any communication with     
suppliers or other parties involved. This helps to give an accurate picture of the situation and demonstrates that we're committed to resolving it fairly and efficiently.       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
It's also important to acknowledge potential causes for the delay: whether there was a supply issue, logistics problem, human error on our part, etc. We'd respond with some     
suggestions on how we can move forward - this could involve finding replacements or alternatives from different suppliers, making any necessary adjustments to our current       
timeline, implementing quality control measures before moving people into their order again, or simply communicating the details of what happened so they can plan for it in     
future orders.                                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Lastly, I'd express appreciation for the customer's patience and understanding during this time. We want to maintain a good relationship with them and keep them coming back -   
after all we provide a great product that they value, so let us be happy about your satisfaction with our service.

future orders.

apology for the delay.

It's also important to acknowledge potential causes for the delay: whether there was a supply issue, logistics problem, human error on our part, etc. We'd respond with some     
suggestions on how we can move forward - this could involve finding replacements or alternatives from different suppliers, making any necessary adjustments to our current       
timeline, implementing quality control measures before moving people into their order again, or simply communicating the details of what happened so they can plan for it in     
future orders.
