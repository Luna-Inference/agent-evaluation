To find the mean, you add up all the numbers and divide by how many numbers there are.                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, let's add up all the numbers:                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 = 30                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
There are 5 numbers in total.                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now, we divide the sum by the number of numbers:                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
30 ÷ 5 = 6                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So, the mean is 6.

            Here is your code snippet:
            To find the mean, you add up all the numbers and divide by how many numbers there are.

First, let's add up all the numbers:

2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 = 30

There are 5 numbers in total.

Now, we divide the sum by the number of numbers:

30 ÷ 5 = 6

So, the mean is 6.

The mean is the sum divided by the number of numbers, so we need to add up all the numbers and divide 30 by 5. The sum is 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 = 30. There are 5 numbers in total. 
Dividing 30 by 5 gives us a mean of 6.

Reached max steps.
[Step 21: Duration 9.31 seconds| Input tokens: 110,664 | Output tokens: 1,678]

Output:
To find the mean of these numbers, we need to add them up and divide by how many numbers there are.

First, let's add up all the numbers:

2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 = 30

There are 5 numbers in total. To find the mean, we can divide the sum by the number of values:

30 / 5 = 6

So, the mean is 6.

Task 13 complete.
