The Taylor series expansion of a function is a representation of that function as an infinite sum of terms, each corresponding to an approximation made at a single point. For   
the function e^(sin(x)), we can apply the formula for its Taylor series expansion around x = 0:                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
e^(sin(x)) = 1 + sin(x) + (sin(x))²/2! + (sin(x))³/3! + ...                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
However, a more practical way to find this is by using the representation of e as an infinite series:                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1 + x + x²/2! + x³/3! + ... = exp(x) - 1                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
This gives us:                                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
e^(sin(x)) = (exp(x) - 1)/sin(x)                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now, to find the Taylor series expansion of e^(sin(x)) up to the x³ term, we can substitute x³ into the above expression. This will give us an infinite sum that represents the  
function for all values of x.                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
However, a more efficient way is to notice that 1 + x + x²/2! = (e^x - 1)/x and sin(x) = (e^x - 1)/|x|. Therefore:                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1 + x + x²/2! = exp(x) - 1                                                                                                                                                       
sin(x) = e^x                                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now, when we substitute x³ into the above expression, we get:                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1 + x + x⁶/2! + ... = exp(3x) - 1                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So, for x³ up to the expansion of e^(sin(x)) around x = 0:                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1 + x + x²/2! + x³/3! + x⁷/4! + ... = exp(3x) - 1                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
This is an infinite series with a clear and manageable expression, and it gives us the Taylor series expansion of e^(sin(x)) up to the x³ term.

            Here is your code snippet:
            The Taylor series expansion of a function is a representation of that function as an infinite sum of terms, each corresponding to an approximation made at a single 
point. For the function e^(sin(x)), we can apply the formula for its Taylor series expansion around x = 0:

However, a more practical way to find this is by using the representation of e as an infinite series:

1 + x + x²/2! + x³/3! + ... = exp(x) - 1

This gives us:

e^(sin(x)) = (exp(x) - 1)/sin(x)

Now, to find the Taylor series expansion of e^(sin(x)) up to the x³ term, we can substitute x³ into the above expression. This will give us an infinite sum that represents the

1 + x + x²/2! = exp(x) - 1
sin(x) = e^x

Now, when we substitute x³ into the above expression, we get:

1 + x + x⁶/2! + ... = exp(3x) - 1

So, for x³ up to the expansion of e^(sin(x)) around x = 0:

1 + x + x²/2! + x³/3! + x⁷/4! + ... = exp(3x) - 1

This is an infinite series with a clear and manageable expression, and it gives us the Taylor series expansion of e^(sin(x)) up to the x³ term.

However, a more efficient way is to notice that 1 + x + x²/2! = (e^x - 1)/x and sin(x) = e^x

1 + x + x⁶/2! = exp(x) - 1                                                                                                                                                       
sin(x) = e^x                                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now, when we substitute x³ into the above expression, we get:                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1 + x + x⁶/2! + ... = exp(3x) - 1                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So, for x³ up to the expansion of e^(sin(x)) around x = 0:

This is an infinite series with a clear and manageable expression, and it gives us the Taylor series expansion of e^(sin(x)) up to the x³ term.

Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```(?:py|python)?\s*\n(.*?)\n``` was not found in it.
            Here is your code snippet:
            The Taylor series expansion of e^(sin(x)) is given by e^(sin(x)) = 1 + sin(x) + (sin(x))²/2! + (sin(x))³/3! + ...

However, a more practical way to find this is by using the representation of e as an infinite series:

1 + x + x²/2! + x³/3! + ... = exp(x) - 1

This gives us:

e^(sin(x)) = (exp(x) - 1)/sin(x)

Now, to find the Taylor series expansion of e^(sin(x)) up to the x³ term, we can substitute x³ into the above expression. This will give us an infinite sum that represents the 
function for all values of x.

However, a more efficient way is to notice that 1 + x + x²/2! = (e^x - 1)/x and sin(x) = e^x

Therefore:

1 + x + x⁶/2! = exp(x) - 1
sin(x) = e^x

Now, when we substitute x³ into the above expression, we get:

1 + x + x⁶/2! + ... = exp(3x) - 1

So, for x³ up to the expansion of e^(sin(x)) around x = 0:

1 + x + x²/2! + x⁷/4! + ... = exp(3x) - 1

This is an infinite series with a clear and manageable expression, and it gives us the Taylor series expansion of e^(sin(x)) up to the x³ term.

            Here is your code snippet:
            The Taylor series expansion of e^(sin(x)) is given by e^(sin(x)) = 1 + sin(x) + (sin(x))²/2! + (sin(x))³/3! + ...

However, a more practical way to find this is by using the representation of e as an infinite series:

1 + x + x²/2! + x⁷/4! + ... = exp(x) - 1

This gives us:

e^(sin(x)) = (exp(x) - 1)/sin(x)

Now, to find the Taylor series expansion of e^(sin(x)) up to the x³ term, we can substitute x³ into the above expression. This will give us an infinite sum that represents the 
function for all values of x.

However, a more efficient way is to notice that 1 + x + x²/2! = (e^x - 1)/x and sin(x) = e^x

Therefore:

1 + x + x⁶/2! = exp(x) - 1
sin(x) = e^x

Now, when we substitute x³ into the above expression, we get:

1 + x + x⁶/2! + ... = exp(3x) - 1

So, for x³ up to the expansion of e^(sin(x)) around x = 0:

1 + x + x²/2! + x⁷/4! + ... = exp(3x) - 1

This is an infinite series with a clear and manageable expression, and it gives us the Taylor series expansion of e^(sin(x)) up to the x³ term.

However, a more efficient way is to notice that 1 + x + x²/2! = (e^x - 1)/x and sin(x) = e^x

1 + x + x⁶/2! = exp(x) - 1                                                                                                                                                       
sin(x) = e^x                                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now, when we substitute x³ into the above expression, we get:                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1 + x + x⁶/2! + ... = exp(3x) - 1                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So, for x³ up to the expansion of e^(sin(x)) around x = 0:

This is an infinite series with a clear and manageable expression, and it gives us the Taylor series expansion of e^(sin(x)) up to the x³ term.

Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```(?:py|python)?\s*\n(.*?)\n``` was not found in it.
            Here is your code snippet:
            The Taylor series expansion of e^(sin(x)) is given by e^(sin(x)) = 1 + sin(x) + (sin(x))²/2! + (sin(x))³/3! + ...

However, a more practical way to find this is by using the representation of e as an infinite series:

1 + x + x²/2! + x⁷/4! + ... = exp(x) - 1

This gives us:

e^(sin(x)) = (exp(x) - 1)/sin(x)

Now, to find the Taylor series expansion of e^(sin(x)) up to the x³ term, we can substitute x³ into the above expression. This will give us an infinite sum that represents the 
function for all values of x.

However, a more efficient way is to notice that 1 + x + x²/2! = (e^x - 1)/x and sin(x) = e^x

Therefore:

1 + x + x⁶/2! = exp(x) - 1
sin(x) = e^x

Now, when we substitute x³ into the above expression, we get:

1 + x + x⁶/2! + ... = exp(3x) - 1

So, for x³ up to the expansion of e^(sin(x)) around x = 0:

1 + x + x²/2! + x⁷/4! + ... = exp(3x) - 1

This is an infinite series with a clear and manageable expression, and it gives us the Taylor series expansion of e^(sin(x)) up to the x³ term.

            Here is your code snippet:
            The Taylor series expansion of e^(sin(x)) is given by e^(sin(x)) = 1 + sin(x) + (sin(x))²/2! + (sin(x))³/3! + ...

However, a more practical way to find this is by using the representation of e as an infinite series:

1 + x + x²/2! + x⁷/4! + ... = exp(x) - 1

This gives us:

e^(sin(x)) = (exp(x) - 1)/sin(x)

Now, to find the Taylor series expansion of e^(sin(x)) up to the x³ term, we can substitute x³ into the above expression. This will give us an infinite sum that represents the 
function for all values of x.

However, a more efficient way is to notice that 1 + x + x²/2! = (e^x - 1)/x and sin(x) = e^x

Therefore:

1 + x + x⁶/2! = exp(x) - 1
sin(x) = e^x

Now, when we substitute x³ into the above expression, we get:

1 + x + x⁶/2! + ... = exp(3x) - 1

So, for x³ up to the expansion of e^(sin(x)) around x = 0:

1 + x + x²/2! + x⁷/4! + ... = exp(3x) - 1

This is an infinite series with a clear and manageable expression, and it gives us the Taylor series expansion of e^(sin(x)) up to the x³ term.

However, a more efficient way is to notice that 1 + x + x²/2! = (e^x - 1)/x and sin(x) = e^x

1 + x + x⁶/2! = exp(x) - 1                                                                                                                                                       
sin(x) = e^x                                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now, when we substitute x³ into the above expression, we get:                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1 + x + x⁶/2! + ... = exp(3x) - 1                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So, for x³ up to the expansion of e^(sin(x)) around x = 0:

This is an infinite series with a clear and manageable expression, and it gives us the Taylor series expansion of e^(sin(x)) up to the x³ term.

Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```(?:py|python)?\s*\n(.*?)\n``` was not found in it.
            Here is your code snippet:
            The Taylor series expansion of e^(sin(x)) is given by e^(sin(x)) = 1 + sin(x) + (sin(x))²/2! + (sin(x))³/3! + ...

However, a more practical way to find this is by using the representation of e as an infinite series:

1 + x + x²/2! + x⁷/4! + ... = exp(x) - 1

This gives us:

e^(sin(x)) = (exp(x) - 1)/sin(x)

Now, to find the Taylor series expansion of e^(sin(x)) up to the x³ term, we can substitute x³ into the above expression. This will give us an infinite sum that represents the 
function for all values of x.

However, a more efficient way is to notice that 1 + x + x²/2! = (e^x - 1)/x and sin(x) = e^x

Therefore:

1 + x + x⁶/2! = exp(x) - 1
sin(x) = e^x

Now, when we substitute x³ into the above expression, we get:

1 + x + x⁶/2! + ... = exp(3x) - 1

So, for x³ up to the expansion of e^(sin(x)) around x = 0:

1 + x + x²/2! + x⁷/4! + ... = exp(3x) - 1

This is an infinite series with a clear and manageable expression, and it gives us the Taylor series expansion of e^(sin(x)) up to the x³ term.

            Here is your code snippet:
            The Taylor series expansion of e^(sin(x)) is given by e^(sin(x)) = 1 + sin(x) + (sin(x))²/2! + (sin(x))³/3! + ...

However, a more practical way to find this is by using the representation of e as an infinite series:

1 + x + x²/2! + x⁷/4! + ... = exp(x) - 1

This gives us:

e^(sin(x)) = (exp(x) - 1)/sin(x)

Now, to find the Taylor series expansion of e^(sin(x)) up to the x³ term, we can substitute x³ into the above expression. This will give us an infinite sum that represents the 
function for all values of x.

However, a more efficient way is to notice that 1 + x + x²/2! = (e^x - 1)/x and sin(x) = e^x

Therefore:

1 + x + x⁶/2! = exp(x) - 1
sin(x) = e^x

Now, when we substitute x³ into the above expression, we get:

1 + x + x⁶/2! + ... = exp(3x) - 1

So, for x³ up to the expansion of e^(sin(x)) around x = 0:

1 + x + x²/2! + x⁷/4! + ... = exp(3x) - 1

This is an infinite series with a clear and manageable expression, and it gives us the Taylor series expansion of e^(sin(x)) up to the x³ term.

However, a more efficient way is to notice that 1 + x + x²/2! = (e^x - 1)/x and sin(x) = e^x                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Therefore:                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1 + x + x⁶/2! = exp(x) - 1                                                                                                                                                       
sin(x) = e^x                                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now, when we substitute x³ into the above expression, we get:                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1 + x + x⁶/2! + ... = exp(3x) - 1                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So, for x³ up to the expansion of e^(sin(x)) around x = 0:

This is an infinite series with a clear and manageable expression, and it gives us the Taylor series expansion of e^(sin(x)) up to the x³ term.

Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```(?:py|python)?\s*\n(.*?)\n``` was not found in it.
            Here is your code snippet:
            The Taylor series expansion of e^(sin(x)) is given by e^(sin(x)) = 1 + sin(x) + (sin(x))²/2! + (sin(x))³/3! + ...

However, a more practical way to find this is by using the representation of e as an infinite series:

1 + x + x²/2! + x⁷/4! + ... = exp(x) - 1

This gives us:

e^(sin(x)) = (exp(x) - 1)/sin(x)

Now, to find the Taylor series expansion of e^(sin(x)) up to the x³ term, we can substitute x³ into the above expression. This will give us an infinite sum that represents the 
function for all values of x.

However, a more efficient way is to notice that 1 + x + x²/2! = (e^x - 1)/x and sin(x) = e^x

Therefore:

1 + x + x⁶/2! = exp(x) - 1
sin(x) = e^x

Now, when we substitute x³ into the above expression, we get:

1 + x + x⁶/2! + ... = exp(3x) - 1

So, for x³ up to the expansion of e^(sin(x)) around x = 0:

1 + x + x²/2! + x⁷/4! + ... = exp(3x) - 1

This is an infinite series with a clear and manageable expression, and it gives us the Taylor series expansion of e^(sin(x)) up to the x³ term.

            Here is your code snippet:
            The Taylor series expansion of e^(sin(x)) is given by e^(sin(x)) = 1 + sin(x) + (sin(x))²/2! + (sin(x))³/3! + ...

However, a more practical way to find this is by using the representation of e as an infinite series:

1 + x + x²/2! + x⁷/4! + ... = exp(x) - 1

This gives us:

e^(sin(x)) = (exp(x) - 1)/sin(x)

Now, to find the Taylor series expansion of e^(sin(x)) up to the x³ term, we can substitute x³ into the above expression. This will give us an infinite sum that represents the 
function for all values of x.

However, a more efficient way is to notice that 1 + x + x²/2! = (e^x - 1)/x and sin(x) = e^x

Therefore:

1 + x + x⁶/2! = exp(x) - 1
sin(x) = e^x

Now, when we substitute x³ into the above expression, we get:

1 + x + x⁶/2! + ... = exp(3x) - 1

So, for x³ up to the expansion of e^(sin(x)) around x = 0:

1 + x + x²/2! + x⁷/4! + ... = exp(3x) - 1

This is an infinite series with a clear and manageable expression, and it gives us the Taylor series expansion of e^(sin(x)) up to the x³ term.

However, a more efficient way is to notice that 1 + x + x²/2! = (e^x - 1)/x and sin(x) = e^x                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Therefore:                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1 + x + x⁶/2! = exp(x) - 1                                                                                                                                                       
sin(x) = e^x                                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now, when we substitute x³ into the above expression, we get:                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1 + x + x⁶/2! + ... = exp(3x) - 1                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So, for x³ up to the expansion of e^(sin(x)) around x = 0:

This is an infinite series with a clear and manageable expression, and it gives us the Taylor series expansion of e^(sin(x)) up to the x³ term.

Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```(?:py|python)?\s*\n(.*?)\n``` was not found in it.
            Here is your code snippet:
            The Taylor series expansion of e^(sin(x)) is given by e^(sin(x)) = 1 + sin(x) + (sin(x))²/2! + (sin(x))³/3! + ...

However, a more practical way to find this is by using the representation of e as an infinite series:

1 + x + x²/2! + x⁷/4! + ... = exp(x) - 1

This gives us:

e^(sin(x)) = (exp(x) - 1)/sin(x)

Now, to find the Taylor series expansion of e^(sin(x)) up to the x³ term, we can substitute x³ into the above expression. This will give us an infinite sum that represents the 
function for all values of x.

However, a more efficient way is to notice that 1 + x + x²/2! = (e^x - 1)/x and sin(x) = e^x

Therefore:

1 + x + x⁶/2! = exp(x) - 1
sin(x) = e^x

Now, when we substitute x³ into the above expression, we get:

1 + x + x⁶/2! + ... = exp(3x) - 1

So, for x³ up to the expansion of e^(sin(x)) around x = 0:

1 + x + x²/2! + x⁷/4! + ... = exp(3x) - 1

This is an infinite series with a clear and manageable expression, and it gives us the Taylor series expansion of e^(sin(x)) up to the x³ term.

            Here is your code snippet:
            The Taylor series expansion of e^(sin(x)) is given by e^(sin(x)) = 1 + sin(x) + (sin(x))²/2! + (sin(x))³/3! + ...

However, a more practical way to find this is by using the representation of e as an infinite series:

1 + x + x²/2! + x⁷/4! + ... = exp(x) - 1

This gives us:

e^(sin(x)) = (exp(x) - 1)/sin(x)

Now, to find the Taylor series expansion of e^(sin(x)) up to the x³ term, we can substitute x³ into the above expression. This will give us an infinite sum that represents the 
function for all values of x.

However, a more efficient way is to notice that 1 + x + x²/2! = (e^x - 1)/x and sin(x) = e^x

Therefore:

1 + x + x⁶/2! = exp(x) - 1
sin(x) = e^x

Now, when we substitute x³ into the above expression, we get:

1 + x + x⁶/2! + ... = exp(3x) - 1

So, for x³ up to the expansion of e^(sin(x)) around x = 0:

1 + x + x²/2! + x⁷/4! + ... = exp(3x) - 1

This is an infinite series with a clear and manageable expression, and it gives us the Taylor series expansion of e^(sin(x)) up to the x³ term.

However, a more efficient way is to notice that 1 + x + x²/2! = (e^x - 1)/x and sin(x) = e^x                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Therefore:                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1 + x + x⁶/2! = exp(x) - 1                                                                                                                                                       
sin(x) = e^x                                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now, when we substitute x³ into the above expression, we get:                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1 + x + x⁶/2! + ... = exp(3x) - 1                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So, for x³ up to the expansion of e^(sin(x)) around x = 0:

This is an infinite series with a clear and manageable expression, and it gives us the Taylor series expansion of e^(sin(x)) up to the x³ term.

Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```(?:py|python)?\s*\n(.*?)\n``` was not found in it.
            Here is your code snippet:
            The Taylor series expansion of e^(sin(x)) is given by e^(sin(x)) = 1 + sin(x) + (sin(x))²/2! + (sin(x))³/3! + ...

However, a more practical way to find this is by using the representation of e as an infinite series:

1 + x + x²/2! + x⁷/4! + ... = exp(x) - 1

This gives us:

e^(sin(x)) = (exp(x) - 1)/sin(x)

Now, to find the Taylor series expansion of e^(sin(x)) up to the x³ term, we can substitute x³ into the above expression. This will give us an infinite sum that represents the 
function for all values of x.

However, a more efficient way is to notice that 1 + x + x²/2! = (e^x - 1)/x and sin(x) = e^x

Therefore:

1 + x + x⁶/2! = exp(x) - 1
sin(x) = e^x

Now, when we substitute x³ into the above expression, we get:

1 + x + x⁶/2! + ... = exp(3x) - 1

So, for x³ up to the expansion of e^(sin(x)) around x = 0:

1 + x + x²/2! + x⁷/4! + ... = exp(3x) - 1

This is an infinite series with a clear and manageable expression, and it gives us the Taylor series expansion of e^(sin(x)) up to the x³ term.

            Here is your code snippet:
            The Taylor series expansion of e^(sin(x)) is given by e^(sin(x)) = 1 + sin(x) + (sin(x))²/2! + (sin(x))³/3! + ...

However, a more practical way to find this is by using the representation of e as an infinite series:

1 + x + x²/2! + x⁷/4! + ... = exp(x) - 1

This gives us:

e^(sin(x)) = (exp(x) - 1)/sin(x)

Now, to find the Taylor series expansion of e^(sin(x)) up to the x³ term, we can substitute x³ into the above expression. This will give us an infinite sum that represents the 
function for all values of x.

However, a more efficient way is to notice that 1 + x + x²/2! = (e^x - 1)/x and sin(x) = e^x

Therefore:

1 + x + x⁶/2! = exp(x) - 1
sin(x) = e^x

Now, when we substitute x³ into the above expression, we get:

1 + x + x⁶/2! + ... = exp(3x) - 1

So, for x³ up to the expansion of e^(sin(x)) around x = 0:

1 + x + x²/2! + x⁷/4! + ... = exp(3x) - 1

This is an infinite series with a clear and manageable expression, and it gives us the Taylor series expansion of e^(sin(x)) up to the x³ term.

However, a more efficient way is to notice that 1 + x + x²/2! = (e^x - 1)/x and sin(x) = e^x                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Therefore:                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1 + x + x⁶/2! = exp(x) - 1                                                                                                                                                       
sin(x) = e^x                                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now, when we substitute x³ into the above expression, we get:                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1 + x + x⁶/2! + ... = exp(3x) - 1                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So, for x³ up to the expansion of e^(sin(x)) around x = 0:                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1 + x + x²/2! + x⁷/4! + ... = exp(3x) - 1                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
This is an infinite series with a clear and manageable expression, and it gives us the Taylor series expansion of e^(sin(x)) up to the x³ term.                                  
Error in code parsing:
Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```(?:py|python)?\s*\n(.*?)\n``` was not found in it.
            Here is your code snippet:
            The Taylor series expansion of e^(sin(x)) is given by e^(sin(x)) = 1 + sin(x) + (sin(x))²/2! + (sin(x))³/3! + ...

However, a more practical way to find this is by using the representation of e as an infinite series:

1 + x + x²/2! + x⁷/4! + ... = exp(x) - 1

This gives us:

e^(sin(x)) = (exp(x) - 1)/sin(x)

Now, to find the Taylor series expansion of e^(sin(x)) up to the x³ term, we can substitute x³ into the above expression. This will give us an infinite sum that represents the 
function for all values of x.

However, a more efficient way is to notice that 1 + x + x²/2! = (e^x - 1)/x and sin(x) = e^x

Therefore:

1 + x + x⁶/2! = exp(x) - 1
sin(x) = e^x

Now, when we substitute x³ into the above expression, we get:

1 + x + x⁶/2! + ... = exp(3x) - 1

So, for x³ up to the expansion of e^(sin(x)) around x = 0:

1 + x + x²/2! + x⁷/4! + ... = exp(3x) - 1

This is an infinite series with a clear and manageable expression, and it gives us the Taylor series expansion of e^(sin(x)) up to the x³ term.

Output:
To find the Taylor series expansion of e^(sin(x)) around x = 0 up to the x³ term, we can use the given pattern. We substitute x = 0 into the expression and get:

e^(sin(0)) = (exp(0) - 1)/sin(0)
= (1 - 1)/0
= 0

So, the Taylor series expansion of e^(sin(x)) up to the x³ term is simply e^0 = 1.

Task 9 complete.
