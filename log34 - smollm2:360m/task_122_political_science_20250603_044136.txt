A democracy is a type of government where power is held by the people themselves. In a democratic system, citizens have the right to vote on laws, participate in public         
discussions, and influence decisions made by their elected representatives.                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
On the other hand, a republic is not a direct reflection of a democracy. A republic is based on the rule of law and government authority. The power is held by an established    
constitutional body that has been chosen or elected to represent the people's interests rather than being derived from popular vote.                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
In other words, all members of society have equal rights under a democratic system but do not necessarily hold political representation in a republic.

Output:
A democracy is a type of government where power is held by the people themselves, rather than being derived from popular vote or elected representatives. In a democracy, decisions are made through direct participation in political processes like voting on laws and public discussions. Examples of democracies include the United States and Germany.

On the other hand, a republic is based on the rule of law and government authority that is derived from established constitutional bodies rather than popular vote or elected representatives. In a republic, power is held by an established body of law and the constitution, which provides for the separation of powers between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. Examples of republics include the United Kingdom and Switzerland.

In summary, democracies are based on direct participation in politics, while republics are based on the rule of law and constitutional authority derived from established bodies of laws.

Task 122 complete.
