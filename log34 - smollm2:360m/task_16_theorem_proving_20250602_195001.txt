To prove that the sum of two even numbers is always even, let's start by defining what an even number is in mathematics. An even number can be expressed as 2 times some integer.
For example, 4 is an even number because it can be written as 2 times an integer (in this case, 1).                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now, consider two numbers: a and b. We want to show that the sum of these two numbers is also even. Let's denote the sum of a and b as c. Using the definition of an even number 
again, we can write c = 2(a + b). Since this expression is equal to 2 times the product of a and b (which was already given), it follows that c must also be even.               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
For example, let's consider the numbers 4 and 6. We could set up the equation:                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
4 = 2(a + b)                                                                                                                                                                     
6 = 2(a + b)                                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now we can solve for a using either equation. However, since both equations are true, this means that the sum of 4 and 6 is also even (because it satisfies both equations).     
Therefore, regardless of the specific values of a and b, we can conclude that the sum of two even numbers is always even.                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
In summary, by using the definition of an even number and setting up the correct equation, we've shown that the sum of any two even numbers is also even. This result has many   
practical applications in mathematics, such as when working with even functions or counting how many times certain patterns repeat.

To prove that the sum of two even numbers is always even, let's start by defining what an even number is in mathematics. An even number can be expressed as 2 times some integer.
For example, 4 is an even number because it can be written as 2 times an integer (in this case, 1).                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now, consider two numbers: a and b. We want to show that the sum of these two numbers is also even. Let's denote the sum of a and b as c. Using the definition of an even number 
again, we can write c = 2(a + b). Since this expression is equal to 2 times the product of a and b (which was already given), it follows that c must also be even.               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
For example, let's consider the numbers 4 and 6. We could set up the equation:                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
4 = 2(a + b)                                                                                                                                                                     
6 = 2(a + b)                                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now we can solve for a using either equation. However, since both equations are true, this means that the sum of 4 and 6 is also even (because it satisfies both equations).     
Therefore, regardless of the specific values of a and b, we can conclude that the sum of two even numbers is always even.                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
In summary, by using the definition of an even number and setting up the correct equation, we've shown that the sum of any two even numbers is always even. This result has many 
practical applications in mathematics, such as when working with even functions or counting how many times certain patterns repeat.

Since this expression is equal to 2 times the product of a and b (which was already given), it follows that c must also be even.               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
For example, let's consider the numbers 4 and 6. We could set up the equation:                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
4 = 2(a + b)                                                                                                                                                                     
6 = 2(a + b)                                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now we can solve for a using either equation. However, since both equations are true, this means that the sum of 4 and 6 is also even (because it satisfies both equations).     
Therefore, regardless of the specific values of a and b, we can conclude that the sum of two even numbers is always even.                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
In summary, by using the definition of an even number and setting up the correct equation, we've shown that the sum of any two even numbers is always even. This result has many 
practical applications in mathematics, such as when working with even functions or counting how many times certain patterns repeat.

4 = 2(a + b)                                                                                                                                                                     
6 = 2(a + b)                                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now we can solve for a using either equation. However, since both equations are true, this means that the sum of 4 and 6 is also even (because it satisfies both equations).     
Therefore, regardless of the specific values of a and b, we can conclude that the sum of two even numbers is always even.                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
In summary, by using the definition of an even number and setting up the correct equation, we've shown that the sum of any two even numbers is always even. This result has many 
practical applications in mathematics, such as when working with even functions or counting how many times certain patterns repeat.

Now, consider two numbers: a and b. We want to show that the sum of these two numbers is also even. Let's denote the sum of a and b as c. Using the definition of an even number 
again, we can write c = 2(a + b). Since this expression is equal to 2 times the product of a and b (which was already given), it follows that c must also be even.

For example, let's consider the numbers 4 and 6. We could set up the equation:

4 = 2(a + b)
6 = 2(a + b)

Now we can solve for a using either equation. However, since both equations are true, this means that the sum of 4 and 6 is also even (because it satisfies both equations).

6 = 2(a + b)                                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now we can solve for a using either equation. However, since both equations are true, this means that the sum of 4 and 6 is also even (because it satisfies both equations).     
Therefore, regardless of the specific values of a and b, we can conclude that the sum of two even numbers is always even.                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
In summary, by using the definition of an even number and setting up the correct equation, we've shown that the sum of any two even numbers is always even. This result has many 
practical applications in mathematics, such as when working with even functions or counting how many times certain patterns repeat.

            To prove that the sum of two even numbers is always even, let's start by defining what an even number is in mathematics. An even number can be expressed as 2 times 
some integer. For example, 4 is an even number because it can be written as 2 times an integer (in this case, 1).

Now, consider two numbers: a and b. We want to show that the sum of these two numbers is also even. Let's denote the sum of a and b as c. Using the definition of an even number 
again, we can write c = 2(a + b). Since this expression is equal to 2 times the product of a and b (which was already given), it follows that c must also be even.

For example, let's consider the numbers 4 and 6. We could set up the equation:

4 = 2(a + b)
6 = 2(a + b)

Now we can solve for a using either equation. However, since both equations are true, this means that the sum of 4 and 6 is also even (because it satisfies both equations).

4 = 2(a + b)                                                                                                                                                                     
6 = 2(a + b)                                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now we can solve for a using either equation. However, since both equations are true, this means that the sum of 4 and 6 is also even (because it satisfies both equations).     
Therefore, regardless of the specific values of a and b, we can conclude that the sum of two even numbers is always even.                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
In summary, by using the definition of an even number and setting up the correct equation, we've shown that the sum of any two even numbers is always even.

            To prove that the sum of two even numbers is always even, let's start by defining what an even number is in mathematics. An even number can be expressed as 2 times 
some integer. For example, 4 is an even number because it can be written as 2 times an integer (in this case, 1).

Now, consider two numbers: a and b. We want to show that the sum of these two numbers is also even. Let's denote the sum of a and b as c. Using the definition of an even number 
again, we can write c = 2(a + b) or simply c = 2*a + 2*b (after converting it into a single multiplication by 2). Since this expression is equal to 2 times the product of a and 
b (which was already given), it follows that c must also be even.

For example, let's consider the numbers 4 and 6. We could set up the equation:

4 = 2(a + b)
6 = 2(a + b)

Now we can solve for a using either equation. However, since both equations are true, this means that the sum of 4 and 6 is also even (because it satisfies both equations). 
Therefore, regardless of the specific values of a and b, we can conclude that the sum of two even numbers is always even.

4 = 2(a + b)                                                                                                                                                                     
6 = 2(a + b)                                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now we can solve for a using either equation. However, since both equations are true, this means that the sum of 4 and 6 is also even (because it satisfies both equations).     
Therefore, regardless of the specific values of a and b, we can conclude that the sum of two even numbers is always even.                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
In summary, by using the definition of an even number and setting up the correct equation, we've shown that the sum of any two even numbers is always even.

            To prove that the sum of two even numbers is always even, let's start by defining what an even number is in mathematics. An even number can be expressed as 2 times 
some integer. For example, 4 is an even number because it can be written as 2 times an integer (in this case, 1).

Now, consider two numbers: a and b. We want to show that the sum of these two numbers is also even. Let's denote the sum of a and b as c. Using the definition of an even number 
again, we can write c = 2(a + b) or simply c = 2*a + 2*b (after converting it into a single multiplication by 2). Since this expression is equal to 2 times the product of a and 
b (which was already given), it follows that c must also be even.

For example, let's consider the numbers 4 and 6. We could set up the equation:

4 = 2(a + b)
6 = 2(a + b)

Now we can solve for a using either equation. However, since both equations are true, this means that the sum of 4 and 6 is also even (because it satisfies both equations). 
Therefore, regardless of the specific values of a and b, we can conclude that the sum of two even numbers is always even.
