To answer this question, I'll use my knowledge database and apply some code steps to follow:

   - Define a function `find_directors(movie_title)` that takes a movie title as input and returns the director's name.

   - Call the `find_directors` function with the movie title "Jaws"                                                                                                              
   - Print out the returned director's name

To solve this task, I'll use my knowledge database and apply some code steps to follow. Here are the steps I will use:

   - Check if there are other movies he has directed before                                                                                                                      
   - Look up any relevant references or articles on his directorial career                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. Code:                                                                                                                                                                         
   - Define a function `find_directors(movie_title)` that takes a movie title as input and returns the director's name.

Output:
I can help with that. Based on your description of the task and the given code snippet, it seems like you're asking for information about the director who directed the 1975 film "Jaws". The relevant part in the code is:

```python
directors = find_directors("Jaws")
```

This line finds all the directors that match the input "Jaws" and assigns them to a variable named `directors`.
