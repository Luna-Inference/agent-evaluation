The American Civil War (1861-1865) was a civil conflict that took place between 1861 and 1865 in the United States, primarily due to disagreement over slavery. Here are the main
causes:                                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Secession of Southern states from the Union: On April 12, 1861, South Carolina seceded, followed by Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas on May 20.   
These secessionist declarations were made in violation of the Constitution and declared the United States as a republic with "equal sovereignty and jurisdiction in its          
constituent parts."                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. Compromise of 1850: A compromise was reached between the North (abolishing slavery) and South (ensuring slave states' representation in Congress). This included the Fugitive 
Slave Act, which required anyone caught aiding escaped slaves to be returned to their owners. The act made it an offense to assist or shelter a fugitive from a free state.      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3. Dred Scott Decision: In 1857, the US Supreme Court declared that African Americans were not citizens and had no right to sue in federal courts for personal injuries caused by
another person's actions based on their color, thereby creating the basis for states' rights versus federal powers and secessionism. This decision was seen as an attack against 
the institution of slavery.                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
4. Rise of sectionalism: The 1830s saw increased tensions between the North (pro-slavery) and South (pro-free). There were disagreements over tariffs, banking systems, and      
westward expansion. The Kansas-Nebraska Act allowed for settlers to decide whether or not to allow slavery in new territories rather than by state law.                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
These factors led to a deep rift between the Northern states (abolishing slavery and supporting the Union) and Southern states (ensuring slavery and preserving the union). The  
disagreement over these issues ultimately led to secession, civil war, and the eventual abolition of slavery in 1865.

1. Secession of Southern states from the Union: On April 12, 1861, South Carolina seceded, followed by Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas on May 20.   
These secessionist declarations were made in violation of the Constitution and declared the United States as a republic with "equal sovereignty and jurisdiction in its          
constituent parts."                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. Compromise of 1850: A compromise was reached between the North (abolishing slavery) and South (ensuring slave states' representation in Congress). This included the Fugitive 
Slave Act, which required anyone caught aiding escaped slaves to be returned to their owners. The act made it an offense to assist or shelter a fugitive from a free state.      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3. Dred Scott Decision: In 1857, the US Supreme Court declared that African Americans were not citizens and had no right to sue in federal courts for personal injuries caused by
another person's actions based on their color, thereby creating the basis for states' rights versus federal powers and secessionism. This decision was seen as an attack against 
the institution of slavery.                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
4. Rise of sectionalism: The 1830s saw increased tensions between the North (pro-slavery) and South (pro-free). There were disagreements over tariffs, banking systems, and      
westward expansion. The Kansas-Nebraska Act allowed for settlers to decide whether or not to allow slavery in new territories rather than by state law.                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
These factors led to a deep rift between the Northern states (abolishing slavery and supporting the Union) and Southern states (ensuring slavery and preserving the union). The  
disagreement over these issues ultimately led to secession, civil war, and the eventual abolition of slavery in 1865.

constituent parts."                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. Compromise of 1850: A compromise was reached between the North (abolishing slavery) and South (ensuring slave states' representation in Congress). This included the Fugitive 
Slave Act, which required anyone caught aiding escaped slaves to be returned to their owners. The act made it an offense to assist or shelter a fugitive from a free state.      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3. Dred Scott Decision: In 1857, the US Supreme Court declared that African Americans were not citizens and had no right to sue in federal courts for personal injuries caused by
another person's actions based on their color, thereby creating the basis for states' rights versus federal powers and secessionism. This decision was seen as an attack against 
the institution of slavery.                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
4. Rise of sectionalism: The 1830s saw increased tensions between the North (pro-slavery) and South (pro-free). There were disagreements over tariffs, banking systems, and      
westward expansion. The Kansas-Nebraska Act allowed for settlers to decide whether or not to allow slavery in new territories rather than by state law.                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
These factors led to a deep rift between the Northern states (abolishing slavery and supporting the Union) and Southern states (ensuring slavery and preserving the union). The  
disagreement over these issues ultimately led to secession, civil war, and the eventual abolition of slavery in 1865.

The act made it an offense to assist or shelter a fugitive from a free state.      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3. Dred Scott Decision: In 1857, the US Supreme Court declared that African Americans were not citizens and had no right to sue in federal courts for personal injuries caused by
another person's actions based on their color, thereby creating the basis for states' rights versus federal powers and secessionism. This decision was seen as an attack against 
the institution of slavery.                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
4. Rise of sectionalism: The 1830s saw increased tensions between the North (pro-slavery) and South (pro-free). There were disagreements over tariffs, banking systems, and      
westward expansion. The Kansas-Nebraska Act allowed for settlers to decide whether or not to allow slavery in new territories rather than by state law.                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
These factors led to a deep rift between the Northern states (abolishing slavery and supporting the Union) and Southern states (ensuring slavery and preserving the union). The  
disagreement over these issues ultimately led to secession, civil war, and the eventual abolition of slavery in 1865.

the institution of slavery.                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
4. Rise of sectionalism: The 1830s saw increased tensions between the North (pro-slavery) and South (pro-free). There were disagreements over tariffs, banking systems, and      
westward expansion. The Kansas-Nebraska Act allowed for settlers to decide whether or not to allow slavery in new territories rather than by state law.                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
These factors led to a deep rift between the Northern states (abolishing slavery and supporting the Union) and Southern states (ensuring slavery and preserving the union). The  
disagreement over these issues ultimately led to secession, civil war, and the eventual abolition of slavery in 1865.

1. Secession of Southern states from the Union: On April 12, 1861, South Carolina seceded, followed by Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas on May 20. 
These secessionist declarations were made in violation of the Constitution and declared the United States as a republic with "equal sovereignty and jurisdiction in its 
constituent parts."

2. Compromise of 1850: A compromise was reached between the North (abolishing slavery) and South (ensuring slave states' representation in Congress). This included the Fugitive 
Slave Act, which required anyone caught aiding escaped slaves to be returned to their owners. The act made it an offense to assist or shelter a fugitive from a free state.

The Kansas-Nebraska Act allowed for settlers to decide whether or not to allow slavery in new territories rather than by state law.                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
These factors led to a deep rift between the Northern states (abolishing slavery and supporting the Union) and Southern states (ensuring slavery and preserving the union). The  
disagreement over these issues ultimately led to secession, civil war, and the eventual abolition of slavery in 1865.

1. Secession of Southern states from the Union: On April 12, 1861, South Carolina seceded, followed by Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas on May 20. 
These secessionist declarations were made in violation of the Constitution and declared the United States as a republic with "equal sovereignty and jurisdiction in its 
constituent parts."

2. Compromise of 1850: A compromise was reached between the North (abolishing slavery) and South (ensuring slave states' representation in Congress). This included the Fugitive 
Slave Act, which required anyone caught aiding escaped slaves to be returned to their owners. The act made it an offense to assist or shelter a fugitive from a free state.

3. Dred Scott Decision: In 1857, the US Supreme Court declared that African Americans were not citizens and had no right to sue in federal courts for personal injuries caused by
another person's actions based on their color, thereby creating the basis for states' rights versus federal powers and secessionism. This decision was seen as an attack against 
the institution of slavery.

Slave Act, which required anyone caught aiding escaped slaves to be returned to their owners. The act made it an offense to assist or shelter a fugitive from a free state.

3. Dred Scott Decision: In 1857, the US Supreme Court declared that African Americans were not citizens and had no right to sue in federal courts for personal injuries caused by
another person's actions based on their color, thereby creating the basis for states' rights versus federal powers and secessionism. This decision was seen as an attack against 
the institution of slavery.

4. Rise of sectionalism: The 1830s saw increased tensions between the North (pro-slavery) and South (pro-free). There were disagreements over tariffs, banking systems, and 
westward expansion. The Kansas-Nebraska Act allowed for settlers to decide whether or not to allow slavery in new territories rather than by state law.

These factors led to a deep rift between the Northern states (abolishing slavery and supporting the Union) and Southern states (ensuring slavery and preserving the union). The 
disagreement over these issues ultimately led to secession, civil war, and the eventual abolition of slavery in 1865.

Output:
The main causes of the American Civil War were primarily related to the disagreement over states' rights versus federal powers and slavery. The 1830s saw increased tensions between the North (pro-slavery) and South (pro-free) regarding issues such as tariffs, banking systems, westward expansion, and westward territorial settlement. These differences led to a growing sense of disunity among southerners, who feared that northern states were taking over their territory. This resentment ultimately contributed to the secession of seven Southern states in 1860, leading to the outbreak of the Civil War.

Task 119 complete.
