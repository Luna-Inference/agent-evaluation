Cellular respiration is a vital process that generates energy for cells. It takes place within the mitochondria, which are often referred to as "powerhouses" because they       
produce most of an organism's ATP (adenosine triphosphate) through oxidative phosphorylation.                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Glycolysis: This stage occurs in the cytosol and involves the breakdown of glucose into pyruvate using a 2-carbon compound called NADH. The products of glycolysis are two    
molecules that will eventually be used for cellular respiration.                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Glycolysis: ATP is produced, along with NADH and FADH2, which become the final electron carriers in the electron transport chain.                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. Krebs Cycle (Citric Acid Cycle): This stage takes place within the mitochondria's inner membrane and involves the oxidation of glucose through a series of 3-carbon molecules,
yielding acetyl-CoA.                                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The citric acid cycle is responsible for generating more NADH and FADH2. The products of glycolysis are used in this stage as well as the Krebs Cycle.                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3. Electron Transport Chain (Oxidative Phosphorylation): This final stage occurs in the inner membrane of the mitochondria, where protons flow back across the membrane through a
series of electron carriers and ATP synthase. This energy is utilized to generate ATP from ADP (adenosine diphosphate).                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The oxidative phosphorylation stage uses the electrons that have passed through the electron transport chain and generates a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial      
membrane. The energy in this gradient is used to produce high-energy bonds of ATP, which are then converted into chemical energy in the form of ADP + inorganic phosphate (ATP). 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The whole process from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation results in 36 molecules of NADH and 2 molecules of FADH2. These electrons are the final electron carriers that    
ultimately lead to the production of ATP.

This energy is utilized to generate ATP from ADP (adenosine diphosphate) + inorganic phosphate (ATP).                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The oxidative phosphorylation stage uses the electrons that have passed through the electron transport chain and generates a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial      
membrane. The energy in this gradient is used to produce high-energy bonds of ATP, which are then converted into chemical energy in the form of ADP + inorganic phosphate (ATP). 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The whole process from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation results in 36 molecules of NADH and 2 molecules of FADH2. These electrons are the final electron carriers that    
ultimately lead to the production of ATP.

            Cellular respiration is a vital process that generates energy for cells. It takes place within the mitochondria, which are often referred to as "powerhouses" because
they produce most of an organism's ATP (adenosine triphosphate) through oxidative phosphorylation.

1. Glycolysis: This stage occurs in the cytosol and involves the breakdown of glucose into pyruvate using a 2-carbon compound called NADH. The products of glycolysis are two 
molecules that will eventually be used for cellular respiration.

Glycolysis: ATP is produced, along with NADH and FADH2, which become the final electron carriers in the electron transport chain.

2. Krebs Cycle (Citric Acid Cycle): This stage takes place within the mitochondria's inner membrane and involves the oxidation of glucose through a series of 3-carbon molecules,
yielding acetyl-CoA.

The citric acid cycle is responsible for generating more NADH and FADH2. The products of glycolysis are used in this stage as well as the Krebs Cycle.

Glycolysis: ATP is produced, along with NADH and FADH2, which become the final electron carriers in the electron transport chain.                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. Krebs Cycle (Citric Acid Cycle): This stage takes place within the mitochondria's inner membrane and involves the oxidation of glucose through a series of 3-carbon molecules,
yielding acetyl-CoA.                                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The citric acid cycle is responsible for generating more NADH and FADH2. The products of glycolysis are used in this stage as well as the Krebs Cycle.                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3. Electron Transport Chain (Oxidative Phosphorylation): This final stage occurs in the inner membrane of the mitochondria, where protons flow back across the membrane through a
series of electron carriers and ATP synthase. This energy is utilized to generate ATP from ADP (adenosine diphosphate) + inorganic phosphate (ATP).                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The oxidative phosphorylation stage uses the electrons that have passed through the electron transport chain and generates a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial      
membrane. The energy in this gradient is used to produce high-energy bonds of ATP, which are then converted into chemical energy in the form of ADP + inorganic phosphate (ATP). 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The whole process from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation results in 36 molecules of NADH and 2 molecules of FADH2. These electrons are the final electron carriers that    
ultimately lead to the production of ATP.

series of electron carriers and ATP synthase. This energy is utilized to generate ATP from ADP (adenosine diphosphate) + inorganic phosphate (ATP).

The oxidative phosphorylation stage uses the electrons that have passed through the electron transport chain and generates a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial 
membrane. The energy in this gradient is used to produce high-energy bonds of ATP, which are then converted into chemical energy in the form of ADP + inorganic phosphate (ATP).

The whole process from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation results in 36 molecules of NADH and 2 molecules of FADH2. These electrons are the final electron carriers that 
ultimately lead to the production of ATP.

membrane. The energy in this gradient is used to produce high-energy bonds of ATP, which are then converted into chemical energy in the form of ADP + inorganic phosphate (ATP). 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The whole process from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation results in 36 molecules of NADH and 2 molecules of FADH2. These electrons are the final electron carriers that

            Cellular respiration is a vital process that generates energy for cells. It takes place within the mitochondria, which are often referred to as "powerhouses" because
they produce most of an organism's ATP (adenosine triphosphate) through oxidative phosphorylation.

1. Glycolysis: This stage occurs in the cytosol and involves the breakdown of glucose into pyruvate using a 2-carbon compound called NADH. The products of glycolysis are two 
molecules that will eventually be used for cellular respiration.

Glycolysis: ATP is produced, along with NADH and FADH2, which become the final electron carriers in the electron transport chain.

2. Krebs Cycle (Citric Acid Cycle): This stage takes place within the mitochondria's inner membrane and involves the oxidation of glucose through a series of 3-carbon molecules,
yielding acetyl-CoA.

The citric acid cycle is responsible for generating more NADH and FADH2. The products of glycolysis are used in this stage as well as the Krebs Cycle.

3. Electron Transport Chain (Oxidative Phosphorylation): This final stage occurs in the inner membrane of the mitochondria, where protons flow back across the membrane through a
series of electron carriers and ATP synthase. This energy is utilized to generate ATP from ADP (adenosine diphosphate) + inorganic phosphate (ATP).

2. Krebs Cycle (Citric Acid Cycle): This stage takes place within the mitochondria's inner membrane and involves the oxidation of glucose through a series of 3-carbon molecules,
yielding acetyl-CoA.                                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The citric acid cycle is responsible for generating more NADH and FADH2. The products of glycolysis are used in this stage as well as the Krebs Cycle.                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3. Electron Transport Chain (Oxidative Phosphorylation): This final stage occurs in the inner membrane of the mitochondria, where protons flow back across the membrane through a
series of electron carriers and ATP synthase. This energy is utilized to generate ATP from ADP (adenosine diphosphate) + inorganic phosphate (ATP).                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The oxidative phosphorylation stage uses the electrons that have passed through the electron transport chain and generates a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial      
membrane. The energy in this gradient is used to produce high-energy bonds of ATP, which are then converted into chemical energy in the form of ADP + inorganic phosphate (ATP). 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The whole process from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation results in 36 molecules of NADH and 2 molecules of FADH2. These electrons are the final electron carriers that    
ultimately lead to the production of ATP.

membrane. The energy in this gradient is used to produce high-energy bonds of ATP, which are then converted into chemical energy in the form of ADP + inorganic phosphate (ATP).

The whole process from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation results in 36 molecules of NADH and 2 molecules of FADH2. These electrons are the final electron carriers that 
ultimately lead to the production of ATP.

Cellular respiration is a vital process that generates energy for cells. It takes place within the mitochondria, which are often referred to as "powerhouses" because they       
produce most of an organism's ATP (adenosine triphosphate) through oxidative phosphorylation.                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Glycolysis: This stage occurs in the cytosol and involves the breakdown of glucose into pyruvate using a 2-carbon compound called NADH. The products of glycolysis are two    
molecules that will eventually be used for cellular respiration.                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Glycolysis: ATP is produced, along with NADH and FADH2, which become the final electron carriers in the electron transport chain.                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. Krebs Cycle (Citric Acid Cycle): This stage takes place within the mitochondria's inner membrane and involves the oxidation of glucose through a series of 3-carbon molecules,
yielding acetyl-CoA.

3. Electron Transport Chain (Oxidative Phosphorylation): This final stage occurs in the inner membrane of the mitochondria, where protons flow back across the membrane through a
series of electron carriers and ATP synthase. This energy is utilized to generate ATP from ADP (adenosine diphosphate) + inorganic phosphate (ATP).

Output:
Cellular respiration is a vital process that generates energy for cells by breaking down glucose into carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O). The process occurs in two main parts: the Krebs Cycle, also known as the tricarboxylic acid cycle or TCA cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation.

In the Krebs Cycle, a series of 3-carbon molecules called citric acid are converted into acetyl-CoA, which then enters the mitochondria's inner membrane. The electrons from NADH and FADH2, two other electron carriers involved in cellular respiration, are transferred to the first molecule of citric acid, initiating a chain reaction that generates ATP through oxidative phosphorylation.

The overall equation for cellular respiration is as follows:

C6H12O6 + 6 O2 → 6 CO2 + 6 H2O

In the oxidation state, carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) are produced as byproducts of the chemical reactions involved in cellular respiration. The energy from these processes is then converted into ATP through oxidative phosphorylation, which takes place in the mitochondria's outer membrane. This process generates a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane that drives the movement of protons back towards the mitochondrial matrix through a series of electron carriers and ATP synthase molecules.

In summary, cellular respiration is the process by which cells convert glucose into energy, producing carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) as byproducts. It occurs in two main parts: the Krebs Cycle (involving citric acid intermediates) and oxidative phosphorylation (occurring in the mitochondria's inner membrane), both of which involve electron transfer reactions that drive the conversion of chemical energy into ATP.

Task 29 complete.
