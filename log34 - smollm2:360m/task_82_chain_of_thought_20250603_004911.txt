To determine how many sheep are left after all but 9 die, let's break down the information given and work our way through it step-by-step:                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. There are 17 sheep in total.                                                                                                                                                  
   - This is the starting point for our calculation.                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. All but 9 die.                                                                                                                                                                
   - Let's denote the number of sheep that die as 'd'. Therefore, the remaining number of sheep will be '17 - d'.                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3. The farmer has a total of only 9 sheep left.                                                                                                                                  
   - So, we can write an equation: 17 - d = 9.                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
4. Now, we need to isolate 'd' by adding 9 to both sides of the equation:                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   (17 - d) + 9 = 9 + 9                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   This simplifies to:                                                                                                                                                           
   26 = 18                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So our equation is:                                                                                                                                                              
   26 = 18                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now we can find the value of 'd' by dividing both sides by 18:                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   d = (26 ÷ 18)                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   We simplify this expression:                                                                                                                                                  
   d = 1.43                                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now that we know 'd', we can calculate the number of sheep left in total after all but 9 die:                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Number of remaining sheep = 17 - d                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
 Number of remaining sheep = 17 - 1.43                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   This simplifies to:                                                                                                                                                           
   15.57 = 17                                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So our equation is:                                                                                                                                                              
  15.57 = 17                                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now we can find the value of 'd':                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   d = (15.57 ÷ 17)                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   We simplify this expression:                                                                                                                                                  
   d = 0.89                                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Therefore, there are 0.89 sheep left after all but 9 die.

            Here is your code snippet:
            To determine how many sheep are left after all but 9 die, let's break down the information given and work our way through it step-by-step:

1. There are 17 sheep in total.
   - This is the starting point for our calculation.

2. All but 9 die.
   - Let's denote the number of sheep that die as 'd'. Therefore, the remaining number of sheep will be '17 - d'.

3. The farmer has a total of only 9 sheep left.
   - So, we can write an equation: 17 - d = 9.

4. Now, we need to isolate 'd' by adding 9 to both sides of the equation:

   (17 - d) + 9 = 9 + 9

   This simplifies to:
   26 = 18

So our equation is:
   26 = 18

Now we can find the value of 'd' by dividing both sides by 18:

   d = (26 ÷ 18)

   We simplify this expression:
   d = 1.43

Now that we know 'd', we can calculate the number of sheep left in total after all but 9 die:

Number of remaining sheep = 17 - d

 Number of remaining sheep = 17 - 1.43

   This simplifies to:
   15.57 = 17

So our equation is:
  15.57 = 17

Now we can find the value of 'd':

   d = (15.57 ÷ 17)

   We simplify this expression:
   d = 0.89

Therefore, there are 0.89 sheep left after all but 9 die.

1. There are 17 sheep in total.                                                                                                                                                  
   - This is the starting point for our calculation.                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. All but 9 die.                                                                                                                                                                
   - Let's denote the number of sheep that die as 'd'. Therefore, the remaining number of sheep will be '17 - d'.                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3. The farmer has a total of only 9 sheep left.                                                                                                                                  
   - So, we can write an equation: 17 - d = 9.                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
4. Now, we need to isolate 'd' by adding 9 to both sides of the equation:                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   (17 - d) + 9 = 9 + 9                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   This simplifies to:                                                                                                                                                           
   26 = 18                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So our equation is:                                                                                                                                                              
   26 = 18                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now we can find the value of 'd' by dividing both sides by 18:

   We simplify this expression:

Now that we know 'd', we can calculate the number of sheep left in total after all but 9 die:                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Number of remaining sheep = 17 - d

  15.57 = 17                                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now we can find the value of 'd':                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   d = (15.57 ÷ 18)                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   We simplify this expression:                                                                                                                                                  
   d = 0.89                                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Therefore, there are 0.89 sheep left after all but 9 die.

            Here is your code snippet:
            To determine how many sheep are left after all but 9 die, let's break down the information given and work our way through it step-by-step:

1. There are 17 sheep in total.
   - This is the starting point for our calculation.

2. All but 9 die.
   - Let's denote the number of sheep that die as 'd'. Therefore, the remaining number of sheep will be '17 - d'.

3. The farmer has a total of only 9 sheep left.
   - So, we can write an equation: 17 - d = 9.

4. Now, we need to isolate 'd' by adding 9 to both sides of the equation:

   (17 - d) + 9 = 9 + 9

   This simplifies to:
   26 = 18

So our equation is:
   26 = 18

Now we can find the value of 'd' by dividing both sides by 18:

   d = (26 ÷ 18)

   We simplify this expression:
   d = 1.43

Now that we know 'd', we can calculate the number of sheep left in total after all but 9 die:

Number of remaining sheep = 17 - d

 Number of remaining sheep = 17 - 1.43

   This simplifies to:
   15.57 = 17

So our equation is:
  15.57 = 17

Now we can find the value of 'd':

   d = (15.57 ÷ 18)

   We simplify this expression:
   d = 0.89

Therefore, there are 0.89 sheep left after all but 9 die.

1. There are 17 sheep in total.                                                                                                                                                  
   - This is the starting point for our calculation.                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. All but 9 die.                                                                                                                                                                
   - Let's denote the number of sheep that die as 'd'. Therefore, the remaining number of sheep will be '17 - d'.                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3. The farmer has a total of only 9 sheep left.                                                                                                                                  
   - So, we can write an equation: 17 - d = 9.                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
4. Now, we need to isolate 'd' by adding 9 to both sides of the equation:                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   (17 - d) + 9 = 9 + 9                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   This simplifies to:                                                                                                                                                           
   26 = 18                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So our equation is:                                                                                                                                                              
   26 = 18                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now we can find the value of 'd' by dividing both sides by 18:                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   d = (26 ÷ 18)                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   We simplify this expression:

Now that we know 'd', we can calculate the number of sheep left in total after all but 9 die:                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Number of remaining sheep = 17 - d                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
 Number of remaining sheep = 17 - 1.43                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   This simplifies to:                                                                                                                                                           
   15.57 = 17                                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So our equation is:                                                                                                                                                              
  15.57 = 17                                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now we can find the value of 'd':                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   d = (15.57 ÷ 18)                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   We simplify this expression:                                                                                                                                                  
   d = 0.89                                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Therefore, there are 0.89 sheep left after all but 9 die.

            Here is your code snippet:
            To determine how many sheep are left after all but 9 die, let's break down the information given and work our way through it step-by-step:

1. There are 17 sheep in total.
   - This is the starting point for our calculation.

2. All but 9 die.
   - Let's denote the number of sheep that die as 'd'. Therefore, the remaining number of sheep will be '17 - d'.

3. The farmer has a total of only 9 sheep left.
   - So, we can write an equation: 17 - d = 9.

4. Now, we need to isolate 'd' by adding 9 to both sides of the equation:

   (17 - d) + 9 = 9 + 9

   This simplifies to:
   26 = 18

So our equation is:
   26 = 18

Now we can find the value of 'd' by dividing both sides by 18:

   d = (26 ÷ 18)

   We simplify this expression:
   d = 1.43

Now that we know 'd', we can calculate the number of sheep left in total after all but 9 die:

Number of remaining sheep = 17 - d

 Number of remaining sheep = 17 - 1.43

   This simplifies to:
   15.57 = 17

So our equation is:
  15.57 = 17

Now we can find the value of 'd':

   d = (15.57 ÷ 18)

   We simplify this expression:
   d = 0.89

Therefore, there are 0.89 sheep left after all but 9 die.

1. There are 17 sheep in total.                                                                                                                                                  
   - This is the starting point for our calculation.                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. All but 9 die.                                                                                                                                                                
   - Let's denote the number of sheep that die as 'd'. Therefore, the remaining number of sheep will be '17 - d'.                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3. The farmer has a total of only 9 sheep left.                                                                                                                                  
   - So, we can write an equation: 17 - d = 9.                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
4. Now, we need to isolate 'd' by adding 9 to both sides of the equation:                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   (17 - d) + 9 = 9 + 9                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   This simplifies to:                                                                                                                                                           
   26 = 18                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So our equation is:                                                                                                                                                              
   26 = 18                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now we can find the value of 'd' by dividing both sides by 18:                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   d = (26 ÷ 18)                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   We simplify this expression:                                                                                                                                                  
   d = 1.43                                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now that we know 'd', we can calculate the number of sheep left in total after all but 9 die:                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Number of remaining sheep = 17 - d                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
 Number of remaining sheep = 17 - 1.43                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   This simplifies to:                                                                                                                                                           
   15.57 = 17                                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So our equation is:                                                                                                                                                              
  15.57 = 17                                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now we can find the value of 'd':                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   d = (15.57 ÷ 18)                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   We simplify this expression:                                                                                                                                                  
   d = 0.89                                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Therefore, there are 0.89 sheep left after all but 9 die.

            Here is your code snippet:
            To determine how many sheep are left after all but 9 die, let's break down the information given and work our way through it step-by-step:

1. There are 17 sheep in total.
   - This is the starting point for our calculation.

2. All but 9 die.
   - Let's denote the number of sheep that die as 'd'. Therefore, the remaining number of sheep will be '17 - d'.

3. The farmer has a total of only 9 sheep left.
   - So, we can write an equation: 17 - d = 9.

4. Now, we need to isolate 'd' by adding 9 to both sides of the equation:

   (17 - d) + 9 = 9 + 9

   This simplifies to:
   26 = 18

So our equation is:
   26 = 18

Now we can find the value of 'd' by dividing both sides by 18:

   d = (26 ÷ 18)

   We simplify this expression:
   d = 1.43

Now that we know 'd', we can calculate the number of sheep left in total after all but 9 die:

Number of remaining sheep = 17 - d

 Number of remaining sheep = 17 - 1.43

   This simplifies to:
   15.57 = 17

So our equation is:
  15.57 = 17

Now we can find the value of 'd':

   d = (15.57 ÷ 18)

   We simplify this expression:
   d = 0.89

Therefore, there are 0.89 sheep left after all but 9 die.

1. There are 17 sheep in total.                                                                                                                                                  
   - This is the starting point for our calculation.                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. All but 9 die.                                                                                                                                                                
   - Let's denote the number of sheep that die as 'd'. Therefore, the remaining number of sheep will be '17 - d'.                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3. The farmer has a total of only 9 sheep left.                                                                                                                                  
   - So, we can write an equation: 17 - d = 9.                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
4. Now, we need to isolate 'd' by adding 9 to both sides of the equation:                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   (17 - d) + 9 = 9 + 9                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   This simplifies to:

So our equation is:

Now we can find the value of 'd' by dividing both sides by 18:                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   d = (26 ÷ 18)                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   We simplify this expression:

 Number of remaining sheep = 17 - 1.43

   We simplify this expression:

Therefore, there are 0.89 sheep left after all but 9 die.

            Here is your code snippet:
            To determine how many sheep are left after all but 9 die, let's break down the information given and work our way through it step-by-step:

1. There are 17 sheep in total.
   - This is the starting point for our calculation.

2. All but 9 die.
   - Let's denote the number of sheep that die as 'd'. Therefore, the remaining number of sheep will be '17 - d'.

3. The farmer has a total of only 9 sheep left.
   - So, we can write an equation: 17 - d = 9.

4. Now, we need to isolate 'd' by adding 9 to both sides of the equation:

   (17 - d) + 9 = 9 + 9

   This simplifies to:
   26 = 18

So our equation is:
   26 = 18

Now we can find the value of 'd' by dividing both sides by 18:

   d = (26 ÷ 18)

   We simplify this expression:
   d = 1.43

Now that we know 'd', we can calculate the number of sheep left in total after all but 9 die:

Number of remaining sheep = 17 - d

 Number of remaining sheep = 17 - 1.43

   This simplifies to:
   15.57 = 17

So our equation is:
  15.57 = 17

Now we can find the value of 'd':

   d = (15.57 ÷ 18)

   We simplify this expression:
   d = 0.89

Therefore, there are 0.89 sheep left after all but 9 die.

1. There are 17 sheep in total.                                                                                                                                                  
   - This is the starting point for our calculation.                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. All but 9 die.                                                                                                                                                                
   - Let's denote the number of sheep that die as 'd'. Therefore, the remaining number of sheep will be '17 - d'.                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3. The farmer has a total of only 9 sheep left.                                                                                                                                  
   - So, we can write an equation: 17 - d = 9.

Now, we need to isolate 'd' by adding 9 to both sides of the equation:                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   (17 - d) + 9 = 9 + 9                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   This simplifies to:                                                                                                                                                           
   26 = 18                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So our equation is:                                                                                                                                                              
   26 = 18                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now we can find the value of 'd' by dividing both sides by 18:                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   d = (26 ÷ 18)                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   We simplify this expression:

Now that we know 'd', we can calculate the number of sheep left in total after all but 9 die:                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Number of remaining sheep = 17 - d                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
 Number of remaining sheep = 17 - 1.43

   We simplify this expression:

Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```(?:py|python)?\s*\n(.*?)\n``` was not found in it.
            Here is your code snippet:
            To determine how many sheep are left after all but 9 die, let's break down the information given and work our way through it step-by-step:

1. There are 17 sheep in total.
   - This is the starting point for our calculation.

2. All but 9 die.
   - Let's denote the number of sheep that die as 'd'. Therefore, the remaining number of sheep will be '17 - d'.

3. The farmer has a total of only 9 sheep left.
   - So, we can write an equation: 17 - d = 9.

4. Now, we need to isolate 'd' by adding 9 to both sides of the equation:

   (17 - d) + 9 = 9 + 9

   This simplifies to:
   26 = 18

So our equation is:
   26 = 18

Now we can find the value of 'd' by dividing both sides by 18:

   d = (26 ÷ 18)

   We simplify this expression:
   d = 1.43

Now that we know 'd', we can calculate the number of sheep left in total after all but 9 die:

Number of remaining sheep = 17 - d

 Number of remaining sheep = 17 - 1.43

   This simplifies to:
   15.57 = 17

So our equation is:
  15.57 = 17

Now we can find the value of 'd':

   d = (15.57 ÷ 18)

   We simplify this expression:
   d = 0.89

Therefore, there are 0.89 sheep left after all but 9 die.

   - Let's denote the number of sheep that die as 'd'. Therefore, the remaining number of sheep will be '17 - d'.                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3. The farmer has a total of only 9 sheep left.                                                                                                                                  
   - So, we can write an equation: 17 - d = 9.                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
4. Now, we need to isolate 'd' by adding 9 to both sides of the equation:                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   (17 - d) + 9 = 9 + 9                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   This simplifies to:                                                                                                                                                           
   26 = 18                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So our equation is:                                                                                                                                                              
   26 = 18                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now we can find the value of 'd' by dividing both sides by 18:                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   d = (26 ÷ 18)                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   We simplify this expression:                                                                                                                                                  
   d = 1.43                                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now that we know 'd', we can calculate the number of sheep left in total after all but 9 die:                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Number of remaining sheep = 17 - d                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
 Number of remaining sheep = 17 - 1.43                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   This simplifies to:

            To determine how many sheep are left after all but 9 die, let's break down the information given and work our way through it step-by-step:

1. There are 17 sheep in total.
   - This is the starting point for our calculation.

2. All but 9 die.
   - Let's denote the number of sheep that die as 'd'. Therefore, the remaining number of sheep will be '17 - d'.

3. The farmer has a total of only 9 sheep left.
   - So, we can write an equation: 17 - d = 9.

4. Now, we need to isolate 'd' by adding 9 to both sides of the equation:

   (17 - d) + 9 = 9 + 9

   This simplifies to:
   26 = 18

So our equation is:
   26 = 18

Now we can find the value of 'd' by dividing both sides by 18:

   d = (26 ÷ 18)

   We simplify this expression:
   d = 1.43

Now that we know 'd', we can calculate the number of sheep left in total after all but 9 die:

Number of remaining sheep = 17 - d

 Number of remaining sheep = 17 - 1.43

   This simplifies to:
   15.57 = 17

So our equation is:
  15.57 = 17

Therefore, the remaining number of sheep will be '17 - d'.

   - So, we can write an equation: 17 - d = 9.                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
4. Now, we need to isolate 'd' by adding 9 to both sides of the equation:                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   (17 - d) + 9 = 9 + 9                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   This simplifies to:                                                                                                                                                           
   26 = 18                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So our equation is:                                                                                                                                                              
   26 = 18                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now we can find the value of 'd' by dividing both sides by 18:                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   d = (26 ÷ 18)                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   We simplify this expression:                                                                                                                                                  
   d = 1.43                                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now that we know 'd', we can calculate the number of sheep left in total after all but 9 die:                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Number of remaining sheep = 17 - d                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
 Number of remaining sheep = 17 - 1.43                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   This simplifies to:

            To determine how many sheep are left after all but 9 die, let's break down the information given and work our way through it step-by-step:

1. There are 17 sheep in total.
   - This is the starting point for our calculation.

2. All but 9 die.
   - Let's denote the number of sheep that die as 'd'. Therefore, the remaining number of sheep will be '17 - d'.

3. The farmer has a total of only 9 sheep left.
   - So, we can write an equation: 17 - d = 9.

4. Now, we need to isolate 'd' by adding 9 to both sides of the equation:

   (17 - d) + 9 = 9 + 9

   This simplifies to:
   26 = 18

So our equation is:
   26 = 18

Now we can find the value of 'd' by dividing both sides by 18:

   d = (26 ÷ 18)

   We simplify this expression:
   d = 1.43

Now that we know 'd', we can calculate the number of sheep left in total after all but 9 die:

Number of remaining sheep = 17 - d

 Number of remaining sheep = 17 - 1.43

   This simplifies to:
   15.57 = 17

   - So, we can write an equation: 17 - d = 9.

Now, we need to isolate 'd' by adding 9 to both sides of the equation:

   We simplify this expression:

            To determine how many sheep are left after all but 9 die, let's break down the information given and work our way through it step-by-step:

1. There are 17 sheep in total.
   - This is the starting point for our calculation.

2. All but 9 die.
   - Let's denote the number of sheep that die as 'd'. Therefore, the remaining number of sheep will be '17 - d'.

3. The farmer has a total of only 9 sheep left.
   - So, we can write an equation: 17 - d = 9.

4. Now, we need to isolate 'd' by adding 9 to both sides of the equation:

   (17 - d) + 9 = 9 + 9

   This simplifies to:
   26 = 18

So our equation is:
   26 = 18

Now we can find the value of 'd' by dividing both sides by 18:

   d = (26 ÷ 18)

   We simplify this expression:
   d = 1.43

Now that we know 'd', we can calculate the number of sheep left in total after all but 9 die:

Number of remaining sheep = 17 - d

 Number of remaining sheep = 17 - 1.43

   This simplifies to:
   15.57 = 17

   - Let's denote the number of sheep that die as 'd'. Therefore, the remaining number of sheep will be '17 - d'.                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3. The farmer has a total of only 9 sheep left.                                                                                                                                  
   - So, we can write an equation: 17 - d = 9.                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
4. Now, we need to isolate 'd' by adding 9 to both sides of the equation:

   This simplifies to:

   We simplify this expression:

Now that we know 'd', we can calculate the number of sheep left in total after all but 9 die:                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Number of remaining sheep = 17 - d                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
 Number of remaining sheep = 17 - 1.43                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   This simplifies to:

            To determine how many sheep are left after all but 9 die, let's break down the information given and work our way through it step-by-step:

1. There are 17 sheep in total.
   - This is the starting point for our calculation.

2. All but 9 die.
   - Let's denote the number of sheep that die as 'd'. Therefore, the remaining number of sheep will be '17 - d'.

3. The farmer has a total of only 9 sheep left.
   - So, we can write an equation: 17 - d = 9.

4. Now, we need to isolate 'd' by adding 9 to both sides of the equation:

   (17 - d) + 9 = 9 + 9

   This simplifies to:
   26 = 18

So our equation is:
   26 = 18

Now we can find the value of 'd' by dividing both sides by 18:

   d = (26 ÷ 18)

   We simplify this expression:
   d = 1.43

Now that we know 'd', we can calculate the number of sheep left in total after all but 9 die:

Number of remaining sheep = 17 - d

 Number of remaining sheep = 17 - 1.43

   This simplifies to:
   15.57 = 17

   - Let's denote the number of sheep that die as 'd'. Therefore, the remaining number of sheep will be '17 - d'.                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3. The farmer has a total of only 9 sheep left.                                                                                                                                  
   - So, we can write an equation: 17 - d = 9.                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
4. Now, we need to isolate 'd' by adding 9 to both sides of the equation:                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   (17 - d) + 9 = 9 + 9                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   This simplifies to:

            To determine how many sheep are left after all but 9 die, let's break down the information given and work our way through it step-by-step:

1. There are 17 sheep in total.
   - This is the starting point for our calculation.

2. All but 9 die.
   - Let's denote the number of sheep that die as 'd'. Therefore, the remaining number of sheep will be '17 - d'.

3. The farmer has a total of only 9 sheep left.
   - So, we can write an equation: 17 - d = 9.

4. Now, we need to isolate 'd' by adding 9 to both sides of the equation:

   (17 - d) + 9 = 9 + 9

   This simplifies to:
   26 = 18

So our equation is:
   26 = 18

Now we can find the value of 'd' by dividing both sides by 18:

   d = (26 ÷ 18)

   We simplify this expression:
   d = 1.43

Now that we know 'd', we can calculate the number of sheep left in total after all but 9 die:

Number of remaining sheep = 17 - d

 Number of remaining sheep = 17 - 1.43

   This simplifies to:
   15.57 = 17

   - Let's denote the number of sheep that die as 'd'. Therefore, the remaining number of sheep will be '17 - d'.                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3. The farmer has a total of only 9 sheep left.                                                                                                                                  
   - So, we can write an equation: 17 - d = 9.                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
4. Now, we need to isolate 'd' by adding 9 to both sides of the equation:                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   (17 - d) + 9 = 9 + 9                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   This simplifies to:                                                                                                                                                           
   26 = 18                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So our equation is:                                                                                                                                                              
   26 = 18                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now we can find the value of 'd' by dividing both sides by 18:

   We simplify this expression:

            To determine how many sheep are left after all but 9 die, let's break down the information given and work our way through it step-by-step:

1. There are 17 sheep in total.
   - This is the starting point for our calculation.

2. All but 9 die.
   - Let's denote the number of sheep that die as 'd'. Therefore, the remaining number of sheep will be '17 - d'.

3. The farmer has a total of only 9 sheep left.
   - So, we can write an equation: 17 - d = 9.

4. Now, we need to isolate 'd' by adding 9 to both sides of the equation:

   (17 - d) + 9 = 9 + 9

   This simplifies to:
   26 = 18

So our equation is:
   26 = 18

Now we can find the value of 'd' by dividing both sides by 18:

   d = (26 ÷ 18)

   We simplify this expression:
   d = 1.43

Now that we know 'd', we can calculate the number of sheep left in total after all but 9 die:

Number of remaining sheep = 17 - d

 Number of remaining sheep = 17 - 1.43

   This simplifies to:
   15.57 = 17

3. The farmer has a total of only 9 sheep left.
   - So, we can write an equation: 17 - d = 9.

4. Now, we need to isolate 'd' by adding 9 to both sides of the equation:

So our equation is:

Now we can find the value of 'd' by dividing both sides by 18:

   We simplify this expression:

Now that we know 'd', we can calculate the number of sheep left in total after all but 9 die:

Number of remaining sheep = 17 - d

 Number of remaining sheep = 17 - 1.43

1. There are 17 sheep in total.                                                                                                                                                  
   - This is the starting point for our calculation.                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. All but 9 die.                                                                                                                                                                
   - Let's denote the number of sheep that die as 'd'. Therefore, the remaining number of sheep will be '17 - d'.                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3. The farmer has a total of only 9 sheep left.                                                                                                                                  
   - So, we can write an equation: 17 - d = 9.                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
4. Now, we need to isolate 'd' by adding 9 to both sides of the equation:                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   (17 - d) + 9 = 9 + 9                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   This simplifies to:                                                                                                                                                           
   26 = 18                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So our equation is:                                                                                                                                                              
   26 = 18                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now we can find the value of 'd' by dividing both sides by 18:                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   d = (26 ÷ 18)                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   We simplify this expression:                                                                                                                                                  
   d = 1.43                                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now that we know 'd', we can calculate the number of sheep left in total after all but 9 die:                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Number of remaining sheep = 17 - d                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
 Number of remaining sheep = 17 - 1.43                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   This simplifies to:

            To determine how many sheep are left after all but 9 die, let's break down the information given and work our way through it step-by-step:

1. There are 17 sheep in total.
   - This is the starting point for our calculation.

2. All but 9 die.
   - Let's denote the number of sheep that die as 'd'. Therefore, the remaining number of sheep will be '17 - d'.

3. The farmer has a total of only 9 sheep left.
   - So, we can write an equation: 17 - d = 9.

4. Now, we need to isolate 'd' by adding 9 to both sides of the equation:

   (17 - d) + 9 = 9 + 9

   This simplifies to:
   26 = 18

So our equation is:
   26 = 18

Now we can find the value of 'd' by dividing both sides by 18:

   d = (26 ÷ 18)

   We simplify this expression:
   d = 1.43

Now that we know 'd', we can calculate the number of sheep left in total after all but 9 die:

Number of remaining sheep = 17 - d

 Number of remaining sheep = 17 - 1.43

   This simplifies to:
   15.57 = 17

2. All but 9 die.                                                                                                                                                                
   - Let's denote the number of sheep that die as 'd'. Therefore, the remaining number of sheep will be '17 - d'.                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3. The farmer has a total of only 9 sheep left.                                                                                                                                  
   - So, we can write an equation: 17 - d = 9.

Now, we need to isolate 'd' by adding 9 to both sides of the equation:                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   (17 - d) + 9 = 9 + 9                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   This simplifies to:                                                                                                                                                           
   26 = 18                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So our equation is:                                                                                                                                                              
   26 = 18                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now we can find the value of 'd' by dividing both sides by 18:                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   d = (26 ÷ 18)                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   We simplify this expression:                                                                                                                                                  
   d = 1.43                                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now that we know 'd', we can calculate the number of sheep left in total after all but 9 die:                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Number of remaining sheep = 17 - d                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
 Number of remaining sheep = 17 - 1.43                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   This simplifies to:

            To determine how many sheep are left after all but 9 die, let's break down the information given and work our way through it step-by-step:

1. There are 17 sheep in total.
   - This is the starting point for our calculation.

2. All but 9 die.
   - Let's denote the number of sheep that die as 'd'. Therefore, the remaining number of sheep will be '17 - d'.

3. The farmer has a total of only 9 sheep left.
   - So, we can write an equation: 17 - d = 9.

4. Now, we need to isolate 'd' by adding 9 to both sides of the equation:

   (17 - d) + 9 = 9 + 9

   This simplifies to:
   26 = 18

So our equation is:
   26 = 18

Now we can find the value of 'd' by dividing both sides by 18:

   d = (26 ÷ 18)

   We simplify this expression:
   d = 1.43

Now that we know 'd', we can calculate the number of sheep left in total after all but 9 die:

Number of remaining sheep = 17 - d

 Number of remaining sheep = 17 - 1.43

   This simplifies to:
   15.57 = 17

3. The farmer has a total of only 9 sheep left.                                                                                                                                  
   - So, we can write an equation: 17 - d = 9.                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
4. Now, we need to isolate 'd' by adding 9 to both sides of the equation:

Now we can find the value of 'd' by dividing both sides by 18:                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   d = (26 ÷ 18)                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   We simplify this expression:                                                                                                                                                  
   d = 1.43                                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now that we know 'd', we can calculate the number of sheep left in total after all but 9 die:                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Number of remaining sheep = 17 - d                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
 Number of remaining sheep = 17 - 1.43

            To determine how many sheep are left after all but 9 die, let's break down the information given and work our way through it step-by-step:

1. There are 17 sheep in total.
   - This is the starting point for our calculation.

2. All but 9 die.
   - Let's denote the number of sheep that die as 'd'. Therefore, the remaining number of sheep will be '17 - d'.

3. The farmer has a total of only 9 sheep left.
   - So, we can write an equation: 17 - d = 9.

4. Now, we need to isolate 'd' by adding 9 to both sides of the equation:

   (17 - d) + 9 = 9 + 9

   This simplifies to:
   26 = 18

So our equation is:
   26 = 18

Now we can find the value of 'd' by dividing both sides by 18:

   d = (26 ÷ 18)

   We simplify this expression:
   d = 1.43

Now that we know 'd', we can calculate the number of sheep left in total after all but 9 die:

Number of remaining sheep = 17 - d

 Number of remaining sheep = 17 - 1.43

   This simplifies to:
   15.57 = 17

Therefore, the remaining number of sheep will be '17 - d'.

   - So, we can write an equation: 17 - d = 9.                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
4. Now, we need to isolate 'd' by adding 9 to both sides of the equation:

   This simplifies to:

            To determine how many sheep are left after all but 9 die, let's break down the information given and work our way through it step-by-step:

1. There are 17 sheep in total.
   - This is the starting point for our calculation.

2. All but 9 die.
   - Let's denote the number of sheep that die as 'd'. Therefore, the remaining number of sheep will be '17 - d'.

3. The farmer has a total of only 9 sheep left.
   - So, we can write an equation: 17 - d = 9.

4. Now, we need to isolate 'd' by adding 9 to both sides of the equation:

   (17 - d) + 9 = 9 + 9

   This simplifies to:
   26 = 18

So our equation is:
   26 = 18

Now we can find the value of 'd' by dividing both sides by 18:

   d = (26 ÷ 18)

   We simplify this expression:
   d = 1.43

Now that we know 'd', we can calculate the number of sheep left in total after all but 9 die:

Number of remaining sheep = 17 - d

 Number of remaining sheep = 17 - 1.43

   This simplifies to:
   15.57 = 17

2. All but 9 die.                                                                                                                                                                
   - Let's denote the number of sheep that die as 'd'. Therefore, the remaining number of sheep will be '17 - d'.                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3. The farmer has a total of only 9 sheep left.                                                                                                                                  
   - So, we can write an equation: 17 - d = 9.                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
4. Now, we need to isolate 'd' by adding 9 to both sides of the equation:                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   (17 - d) + 9 = 9 + 9                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   This simplifies to:                                                                                                                                                           
   26 = 18                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So our equation is:                                                                                                                                                              
   26 = 18                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now we can find the value of 'd' by dividing both sides by 18:

   We simplify this expression:

Now that we know 'd', we can calculate the number of sheep left in total after all but 9 die:                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Number of remaining sheep = 17 - d                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
 Number of remaining sheep = 17 - 1.43                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   This simplifies to:

            To determine how many sheep are left after all but 9 die, let's break down the information given and work our way through it step-by-step:

1. There are 17 sheep in total.
   - This is the starting point for our calculation.

2. All but 9 die.
   - Let's denote the number of sheep that die as 'd'. Therefore, the remaining number of sheep will be '17 - d'.

3. The farmer has a total of only 9 sheep left.
   - So, we can write an equation: 17 - d = 9.

4. Now, we need to isolate 'd' by adding 9 to both sides of the equation:

   (17 - d) + 9 = 9 + 9

   This simplifies to:
   26 = 18

So our equation is:
   26 = 18

Now we can find the value of 'd' by dividing both sides by 18:

   d = (26 ÷ 18)

   We simplify this expression:
   d = 1.43

Now that we know 'd', we can calculate the number of sheep left in total after all but 9 die:

Number of remaining sheep = 17 - d

 Number of remaining sheep = 17 - 1.43

   This simplifies to:
   15.57 = 17

   - Let's denote the number of sheep that die as 'd'. Therefore, the remaining number of sheep will be '17 - d'.

   - So, we can write an equation: 17 - d = 9.                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
4. Now, we need to isolate 'd' by adding 9 to both sides of the equation:

            To determine how many sheep are left after all but 9 die, let's break down the information given and work our way through it step-by-step:

1. There are 17 sheep in total.
   - This is the starting point for our calculation.

2. All but 9 die.
   - Let's denote the number of sheep that die as 'd'. Therefore, the remaining number of sheep will be '17 - d'.

3. The farmer has a total of only 9 sheep left.
   - So, we can write an equation: 17 - d = 9.

4. Now, we need to isolate 'd' by adding 9 to both sides of the equation:

   (17 - d) + 9 = 9 + 9

   This simplifies to:
   26 = 18

So our equation is:
   26 = 18

Now we can find the value of 'd' by dividing both sides by 18:

   d = (26 ÷ 18)

   We simplify this expression:
   d = 1.43

Now that we know 'd', we can calculate the number of sheep left in total after all but 9 die:

Number of remaining sheep = 17 - d

 Number of remaining sheep = 17 - 1.43

   This simplifies to:

To determine how many sheep are left after all but 9 die, let's break down the information given and work our way through it step-by-step:                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. There are 17 sheep in total.                                                                                                                                                  
   - This is the starting point for our calculation.                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. All but 9 die.                                                                                                                                                                
   - Let's denote the number of sheep that die as 'd'. Therefore, the remaining number of sheep will be '17 - d'.                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3. The farmer has a total of only 9 sheep left.                                                                                                                                  
   - So, we can write an equation: 17 - d = 9.                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
4. Now, we need to isolate 'd' by adding 9 to both sides of the equation:                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   (17 - d) + 9 = 9 + 9                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   This simplifies to:                                                                                                                                                           
   26 = 18                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So our equation is:                                                                                                                                                              
   26 = 18                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now we can find the value of 'd' by dividing both sides by 18:                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   d = (26 ÷ 18)                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   We simplify this expression:                                                                                                                                                  
   d = 1.43                                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now that we know 'd', we can calculate the number of sheep left in total after all but 9 die:                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Number of remaining sheep = 17 - d                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
 Number of remaining sheep = 17 - 1.43                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   This simplifies to:

            To determine how many sheep are left after all but 9 die, let's break down the information given and work our way through it step-by-step:

1. There are 17 sheep in total.
   - This is the starting point for our calculation.

2. All but 9 die.
   - Let's denote the number of sheep that die as 'd'. Therefore, the remaining number of sheep will be '17 - d'.

3. The farmer has a total of only 9 sheep left.
   - So, we can write an equation: 17 - d = 9.

4. Now, we need to isolate 'd' by adding 9 to both sides of the equation:

   (17 - d) + 9 = 9 + 9

   This simplifies to:
   26 = 18

So our equation is:
   26 = 18

Now we can find the value of 'd' by dividing both sides by 18:

   d = (26 ÷ 18)

   We simplify this expression:
   d = 1.43

Now that we know 'd', we can calculate the number of sheep left in total after all but 9 die:

Number of remaining sheep = 17 - d

 Number of remaining sheep = 17 - 1.43

   This simplifies to:
   15.57 = 17
