Yes, I'm ready to assist with the new task. To answer this question, we can use a mathematical formula commonly referred to as Einstein's kinetic energy equation (also known as 
F=ma).                                                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The kinetic energy of an object (KE) depends on two factors: its mass (m), and its velocity (v). The formula for kinetic energy is:                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
KE = 0.5 * m * v^2                                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
This formula shows that the kinetic energy of an object can be calculated by multiplying its mass and velocity together, then squaring the result.

KE = 0.5 * m * v^2                                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
This formula shows that the kinetic energy of an object can be calculated by multiplying its mass and velocity together, then squaring the result.
