To analyze the stability of a feedback control system, we need to consider several factors such as poles and zeros. The stability criteria for control systems are based on the  
concept of the Laplace domain, where the input-output relationship is represented by an LTI (Linear Time-Invariant) transfer function G(s).                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The main components that determine a feedback system's stability are:                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Number of poles: A feedback system is considered stable if all its poles are located inside the unit circle in the left half-plane (LHP). Poles outside the LHP indicate      
instability.                                                                                                                                                                     
2. Location of poles: Poles at infinity or on an imaginary axis can cause significant oscillations, while those near the origin may be unstable but do not affect stability      
beyond that point.                                                                                                                                                               
3. Magnitude of poles and zeros: The ratio of the magnitude of a pole to its conjugate (complex conjugate) is used in the design criteria for feedback systems. A low value of   
this ratio indicates good stability properties.                                                                                                                                  
4. Sign of poles: Poles with negative real parts indicate instability or unbounded oscillations, while those with positive real parts are stable.                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
In the context of your transfer function G(s), we can consider the following:                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Number of poles: 3 poles (real part > -2) and 1 pole (complex conjugate = -2). These poles have negative real parts, indicating stability within the unit circle and          
potentially some instability near infinity or on imaginary axes.                                                                                                                 
2. Location of poles: Poles at infinity and on an imaginary axis outside the LHP indicate instability. Poles near the origin may be unstable but do not affect stability beyond  
that point.                                                                                                                                                                      
3. Magnitude of poles: A low value of 0 dB indicates good stability properties, while values close to 1 or -1 may require further analysis.                                      
4. Sign of poles: Poles with negative real parts indicate instability, while those with positive real parts are stable.                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
To determine the stability of your feedback control system, you would need to examine the specific characteristics of the transfer function G(s) and compare them to these       
criteria to identify any potential issues or areas for improvement.

To analyze the stability of a feedback control system with transfer function G(s) = K/(s² + 3s + 2), we need to consider factors such as poles and zeros in the Laplace domain.  
The main components that determine a feedback system's stability are:                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Number of poles: A feedback system is considered stable if all its poles are located inside the unit circle in the left half-plane (LHP). Poles outside the LHP indicate      
instability.                                                                                                                                                                     
2. Location of poles: Poles at infinity or on an imaginary axis can cause significant oscillations, while those near the origin may be unstable but do not affect stability      
beyond that point.                                                                                                                                                               
3. Magnitude of poles and zeros: The ratio of the magnitude of a pole to its conjugate (complex conjugate) is used in the design criteria for feedback systems. A low value of   
this ratio indicates good stability properties.                                                                                                                                  
4. Sign of poles: Poles with negative real parts indicate instability or unbounded oscillations, while those with positive real parts are stable.                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
In the context of your transfer function G(s), we can consider the following:                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Number of poles: 3 poles (real part > -2) and 1 pole (complex conjugate = -2). These poles have negative real parts, indicating stability within the unit circle and          
potentially some instability near infinity or on imaginary axes.                                                                                                                 
2. Location of poles: Poles at infinity and on an imaginary axis outside the LHP indicate instability. Poles near the origin may be unstable but do not affect stability beyond  
that point.                                                                                                                                                                      
3. Magnitude of poles: A low value of 0 dB indicates good stability properties, while values close to 1 or -1 may require further analysis.                                      
4. Sign of poles: Poles with negative real parts indicate instability, while those with positive real parts are stable.                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
To determine the stability of your feedback control system, you would need to examine the specific characteristics of the transfer function G(s) and compare them to these       
criteria to identify any potential issues or areas for improvement.                                                                                                              
            Make sure to include code with the correct pattern, for instance:

To analyze the stability of a feedback control system with transfer function G(s) = K/(s² + 3s + 2), we need to consider factors such as poles and zeros in the Laplace domain.  
The main components that determine a feedback system's stability are:                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Number of poles: A feedback system is considered stable if all its poles are located inside the unit circle (LHP) in the left half-plane (LHP). Poles outside the LHP indicate
instability.                                                                                                                                                                     
2. Location of poles: Poles at infinity or on an imaginary axis can cause significant oscillations, while those near the origin may be unstable but do not affect stability      
beyond that point.                                                                                                                                                               
3. Magnitude of poles and zeros: The ratio of the magnitude of a pole to its conjugate (complex conjugate) is used in the design criteria for feedback systems. A low value of   
this ratio indicates good stability properties.                                                                                                                                  
4. Sign of poles: Poles with negative real parts indicate instability or unbounded oscillations, while those with positive real parts are stable.                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
In the context of your transfer function G(s), we can consider the following:                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Number of poles: 3 poles (real part > -2) and 1 pole (complex conjugate = -2). These poles have negative real parts, indicating stability within the LHP and potentially some 
instability near infinity or on imaginary axes.                                                                                                                                  
2. Location of poles: Poles at infinity and on an imaginary axis outside the LHP indicate instability. Poles near the origin may be unstable but do not affect stability beyond  
that point.                                                                                                                                                                      
3. Magnitude of poles: A low value of 0 dB indicates good stability properties, while values close to 1 or -1 may require further analysis.                                      
4. Sign of poles: Poles with negative real parts indicate instability, while those with positive real parts are stable.                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
To determine the stability of your feedback control system, you would need to examine the specific characteristics of the transfer function G(s) and compare them to these       
criteria to identify any potential issues or areas for improvement.                                                                                                              
            Make sure to include code with the correct pattern, for instance:

To analyze the stability of a feedback control system with transfer function G(s) = K/(s² + 3s + 2), we need to consider factors such as poles and zeros in the Laplace domain.  
The main components that determine a feedback system's stability are:                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Number of poles: A feedback system is considered stable if all its poles are located inside the unit circle (LHP). Poles outside the LHP indicate instability.                
2. Location of poles: Poles at infinity or on an imaginary axis can cause significant oscillations, while those near the origin may be unstable but do not affect stability      
beyond that point.                                                                                                                                                               
3. Magnitude of poles and zeros: The ratio of the magnitude of a pole to its conjugate (complex conjugate) is used in the design criteria for feedback systems. A low value of   
this ratio indicates good stability properties.                                                                                                                                  
4. Sign of poles: Poles with negative real parts indicate instability or unbounded oscillations, while those with positive real parts are stable.                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
In the context of your transfer function G(s), we can consider the following:                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Number of poles: 3 poles (real part > -2) and 1 pole (complex conjugate = -2). These poles have negative real parts, indicating stability within the LHP and potentially some 
instability near infinity or on imaginary axes.                                                                                                                                  
2. Location of poles: Poles at infinity and on an imaginary axis outside the LHP indicate instability. Poles near the origin may be unstable but do not affect stability beyond  
that point.                                                                                                                                                                      
3. Magnitude of poles: A low value of 0 dB indicates good stability properties, while values close to 1 or -1 may require further analysis.                                      
4. Sign of poles: Poles with negative real parts indicate instability, while those with positive real parts are stable.                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
To determine the stability of your feedback control system, you would need to examine the specific characteristics of the transfer function G(s) and compare them to these       
criteria to identify any potential issues or areas for improvement.                                                                                                              
            Make sure to include code with the correct pattern, for instance:

that point.                                                                                                                                                                      
3. Magnitude of poles: A low value of 0 dB indicates good stability properties, while values close to 1 or -1 may require further analysis.                                      
4. Sign of poles: Poles with negative real parts indicate instability, while those with positive real parts are stable.

criteria to identify any potential issues or areas for improvement.

To analyze the stability of a feedback control system with transfer function G(s) = K/(s² + 3s + 2), we need to consider factors such as poles and zeros in the Laplace domain.  
The main components that determine a feedback system's stability are:                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Number of poles: A feedback system is considered stable if all its poles are located inside the unit circle (LHP). Poles outside the LHP indicate instability.                
2. Location of poles: Poles at infinity or on an imaginary axis can cause significant oscillations, while those near the origin may be unstable but do not affect stability      
beyond that point.                                                                                                                                                               
3. Magnitude of poles and zeros: The ratio of the magnitude of a pole to its conjugate (complex conjugate) is used in the design criteria for feedback systems. A low value of   
this ratio indicates good stability properties.                                                                                                                                  
4. Sign of poles: Poles with negative real parts indicate instability or unbounded oscillations, while those with positive real parts are stable.                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
In the context of your transfer function G(s), we can consider the following:                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Number of poles: 3 poles (real part > -2) and 1 pole (complex conjugate = -2). These poles have negative real parts, indicating stability within the LHP and potentially some 
instability near infinity or on imaginary axes.                                                                                                                                  
2. Location of poles: Poles at infinity and on an imaginary axis outside the LHP indicate instability. Poles near the origin may be unstable but do not affect stability beyond  
that point.                                                                                                                                                                      
3. Magnitude of poles: A low value of 0 dB indicates good stability properties, while values close to 1 or -1 may require further analysis.                                      
4. Sign of poles: Poles with negative real parts indicate instability, while those with positive real parts are stable.                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
To determine the stability of your feedback control system, you would need to examine the specific characteristics of the transfer function G(s) and compare them to these       
criteria to identify any potential issues or areas for improvement.

To analyze the stability of a feedback control system with transfer function G(s) = K/(s² + 3s + 2), we need to consider factors such as poles and zeros in the Laplace domain.  
The main components that determine a feedback system's stability are:                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Number of poles: A feedback system is considered stable if all its poles are located inside the unit circle (LHP). Poles outside the LHP indicate instability.                
2. Location of poles: Poles at infinity or on an imaginary axis can cause significant oscillations, while those near the origin may be unstable but do not affect stability      
beyond that point.                                                                                                                                                               
3. Magnitude of poles and zeros: The ratio of the magnitude of a pole to its conjugate (complex conjugate) is used in the design criteria for feedback systems. A low value of   
this ratio indicates good stability properties.                                                                                                                                  
4. Sign of poles: Poles with negative real parts indicate instability or unbounded oscillations, while those with positive real parts are stable.                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
In the context of your transfer function G(s), we can consider the following:                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Number of poles: 3 poles (real part > -2) and 1 pole (complex conjugate = -2). These poles have negative real parts, indicating stability within the LHP and potentially some 
instability near infinity or on imaginary axes.                                                                                                                                  
2. Location of poles: Poles at infinity and on an imaginary axis outside the LHP indicate instability. Poles near the origin may be unstable but do not affect stability beyond  
that point.                                                                                                                                                                      
3. Magnitude of poles: A low value of 0 dB indicates good stability properties, while values close to 1 or -1 may require further analysis.                                      
4. Sign of poles: Poles with negative real parts indicate instability, while those with positive real parts are stable.                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
To determine the stability of your feedback control system, you would need to examine the specific characteristics of the transfer function G(s) and compare them to these       
criteria to identify any potential issues or areas for improvement.

To analyze the stability of a feedback control system with transfer function G(s) = K/(s² + 3s + 2), we need to consider factors such as poles and zeros in the Laplace domain.  
The main components that determine a feedback system's stability are:                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Number of poles: A feedback system is considered stable if all its poles are located inside the unit circle (LHP). Poles outside the LHP indicate instability.                
2. Location of poles: Poles at infinity or on an imaginary axis can cause significant oscillations, while those near the origin may be unstable but do not affect stability      
beyond that point.                                                                                                                                                               
3. Magnitude of poles and zeros: The ratio of the magnitude of a pole to its conjugate (complex conjugate) is used in the design criteria for feedback systems. A low value of   
this ratio indicates good stability properties.                                                                                                                                  
4. Sign of poles: Poles with negative real parts indicate instability or unbounded oscillations, while those with positive real parts are stable.                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
In the context of your transfer function G(s), we can consider the following:                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Number of poles: 3 poles (real part > -2) and 1 pole (complex conjugate = -2). These poles have negative real parts, indicating stability within the LHP and potentially some 
instability near infinity or on imaginary axes.                                                                                                                                  
2. Location of poles: Poles at infinity and on an imaginary axis outside the LHP indicate instability. Poles near the origin may be unstable but do not affect stability beyond  
that point.                                                                                                                                                                      
3. Magnitude of poles: A low value of 0 dB indicates good stability properties, while values close to 1 or -1 may require further analysis.                                      
4. Sign of poles: Poles with negative real parts indicate instability, while those with positive real parts are stable.                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
To determine the stability of your feedback control system, you would need to examine the specific characteristics of the transfer function G(s) and compare them to these       
criteria to identify any potential issues or areas for improvement.                                                                                                              
            Make sure to include code with the correct pattern, for instance:

To analyze the stability of a feedback control system with transfer function G(s) = K/(s² + 3s + 2), we need to consider factors such as poles and zeros in the Laplace domain.  
The main components that determine a feedback system's stability are:                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Number of poles: A feedback system is considered stable if all its poles are located inside the unit circle (LHP). Poles outside the LHP indicate instability.                
2. Location of poles: Poles at infinity or on an imaginary axis can cause significant oscillations, while those near the origin may be unstable but do not affect stability      
beyond that point.                                                                                                                                                               
3. Magnitude of poles and zeros: The ratio of the magnitude of a pole to its conjugate (complex conjugate) is used in the design criteria for feedback systems. A low value of   
this ratio indicates good stability properties.                                                                                                                                  
4. Sign of poles: Poles with negative real parts indicate instability, while those with positive real parts are stable.                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
In the context of your transfer function G(s), we can consider the following:                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Number of poles: 3 poles (real part > -2) and 1 pole (complex conjugate = -2). These poles have negative real parts, indicating stability within the LHP and potentially some 
instability near infinity or on imaginary axes.                                                                                                                                  
2. Location of poles: Poles at infinity and on an imaginary axis outside the LHP indicate instability. Poles near the origin may be unstable but do not affect stability beyond  
that point.                                                                                                                                                                      
3. Magnitude of poles: A low value of 0 dB indicates good stability properties, while values close to 1 or -1 may require further analysis.                                      
4. Sign of poles: Poles with negative real parts indicate instability, while those with positive real parts are stable.                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
To determine the stability of your feedback control system, you would need to examine the specific characteristics of the transfer function G(s) and compare them to these       
criteria to identify any potential issues or areas for improvement.

Sign of poles: Poles with negative real parts indicate instability, while those with positive real parts are stable.

To analyze the stability of a feedback control system with transfer function G(s) = K/(s² + 3s + 2), we need to consider factors such as poles and zeros in the Laplace domain.  
The main components that determine a feedback system's stability are:                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Number of poles: A feedback system is considered stable if all its poles are located inside the unit circle (LHP). Poles outside the LHP indicate instability.                
2. Location of poles: Poles at infinity or on an imaginary axis can cause significant oscillations, while those near the origin may be unstable but do not affect stability      
beyond that point.                                                                                                                                                               
3. Magnitude of poles and zeros: The ratio of the magnitude of a pole to its conjugate (complex conjugate) is used in the design criteria for feedback systems. A low value of   
this ratio indicates good stability properties.                                                                                                                                  
4. Sign of poles: Poles with negative real parts indicate instability, while those with positive real parts are stable.                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
In the context of your transfer function G(s), we can consider the following:                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Number of poles: 3 poles (real part > -2) and 1 pole (complex conjugate = -2). These poles have negative real parts, indicating stability within the LHP and potentially some 
instability near infinity or on imaginary axes.                                                                                                                                  
2. Location of poles: Poles at infinity and on an imaginary axis outside the LHP indicate instability. Poles near the origin may be unstable but do not affect stability beyond  
that point.                                                                                                                                                                      
3. Magnitude of poles: A low value of 0 dB indicates good stability properties, while values close to 1 or -1 may require further analysis.                                      
4. Sign of poles: Poles with negative real parts indicate instability, while those with positive real parts are stable.

To analyze the stability of a feedback control system with transfer function G(s) = K/(s² + 3s + 2), we need to consider factors such as poles and zeros in the Laplace domain.  
The main components that determine a feedback system's stability are:                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Number of poles: A feedback system is considered stable if all its poles are located inside the unit circle (LHP). Poles outside the LHP indicate instability.                
2. Location of poles: Poles at infinity or on an imaginary axis can cause significant oscillations, while those near the origin may be unstable but do not affect stability      
beyond that point.                                                                                                                                                               
3. Magnitude of poles and zeros: The ratio of the magnitude of a pole to its conjugate (complex conjugate) is used in the design criteria for feedback systems. A low value of   
this ratio indicates good stability properties.                                                                                                                                  
4. Sign of poles: Poles with negative real parts indicate instability, while those with positive real parts are stable.                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
In the context of your transfer function G(s), we can consider the following:                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Number of poles: 3 poles (real part > -2) and 1 pole (complex conjugate = -2). These poles have negative real parts, indicating stability within the LHP and potentially some 
instability near infinity or on imaginary axes.                                                                                                                                  
2. Location of poles: Poles at infinity and on an imaginary axis outside the LHP indicate instability. Poles near the origin may be unstable but do not affect stability beyond  
that point.                                                                                                                                                                      
3. Magnitude of poles: A low value of 0 dB indicates good stability properties, while values close to 1 or -1 may require further analysis.                                      
4. Sign of poles: Poles with negative real parts indicate instability, while those with positive real parts are stable.                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
To determine the stability of your feedback control system, you would need to examine the specific characteristics of the transfer function G(s) and compare them to these       
criteria to identify any potential issues or areas for improvement.                                                                                                              
            Make sure to include code with the correct pattern, for instance:

To analyze the stability of a feedback control system with transfer function G(s) = K/(s² + 3s + 2), we need to consider factors such as poles and zeros in the Laplace domain.  
The main components that determine a feedback system's stability are:                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Number of poles: A feedback system is considered stable if all its poles are located inside the unit circle (LHP). Poles outside the LHP indicate instability.                
2. Location of poles: Poles at infinity or on an imaginary axis can cause significant oscillations, while those near the origin may be unstable but do not affect stability      
beyond that point.                                                                                                                                                               
3. Magnitude of poles and zeros: The ratio of the magnitude of a pole to its conjugate (complex conjugate) is used in the design criteria for feedback systems. A low value of   
this ratio indicates good stability properties.                                                                                                                                  
4. Sign of poles: Poles with negative real parts indicate instability, while those with positive real parts are stable.                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
In the context of your transfer function G(s), we can consider the following:                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Number of poles: 3 poles (real part > -2) and 1 pole (complex conjugate = -2). These poles have negative real parts, indicating stability within the LHP and potentially some 
instability near infinity or on imaginary axes.                                                                                                                                  
2. Location of poles: Poles at infinity and on an imaginary axis outside the LHP indicate instability. Poles near the origin may be unstable but do not affect stability beyond  
that point.                                                                                                                                                                      
3. Magnitude of poles: A low value of 0 dB indicates good stability properties, while values close to 1 or -1 may require further analysis.                                      
4. Sign of poles: Poles with negative real parts indicate instability, while those with positive real parts are stable.                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
To determine the stability of your feedback control system, you would need to examine the specific characteristics of the transfer function G(s) and compare them to these       
criteria to identify any potential issues or areas for improvement.                                                                                                              
            Make sure to include code with the correct pattern, for instance:

In the context of your transfer function G(s), we can consider the following:                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Number of poles: 3 poles (real part > -2) and 1 pole (complex conjugate = -2). These poles have negative real parts, indicating stability within the LHP and potentially some 
instability near infinity or on imaginary axes.                                                                                                                                  
2. Location of poles: Poles at infinity and on an imaginary axis outside the LHP indicate instability. Poles near the origin may be unstable but do not affect stability beyond  
that point.                                                                                                                                                                      
3. Magnitude of poles: A low value of 0 dB indicates good stability properties, while values close to 1 or -1 may require further analysis.                                      
4. Sign of poles: Poles with negative real parts indicate instability, while those with positive real parts are stable.

To analyze the stability of a feedback control system with transfer function G(s) = K/(s² + 3s + 2), we need to consider factors such as poles and zeros in the Laplace domain.  
The main components that determine a feedback system's stability are:                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Number of poles: A feedback system is considered stable if all its poles are located inside the unit circle (LHP). Poles outside the LHP indicate instability.                
2. Location of poles: Poles at infinity or on an imaginary axis can cause significant oscillations, while those near the origin may be unstable but do not affect stability      
beyond that point.                                                                                                                                                               
3. Magnitude of poles and zeros: The ratio of the magnitude of a pole to its conjugate (complex conjugate) is used in the design criteria for feedback systems. A low value of   
this ratio indicates good stability properties.                                                                                                                                  
4. Sign of poles: Poles with negative real parts indicate instability, while those with positive real parts are stable.                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
In the context of your transfer function G(s), we can consider the following:

To analyze the stability of a feedback control system with transfer function G(s) = K/(s² + 3s + 2), we need to consider factors such as poles and zeros in the Laplace domain.  
The main components that determine a feedback system's stability are:                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Number of poles: A feedback system is considered stable if all its poles are located inside the unit circle (LHP). Poles outside the LHP indicate instability.                
2. Location of poles: Poles at infinity or on an imaginary axis can cause significant oscillations, while those near the origin may be unstable but do not affect stability      
beyond that point.                                                                                                                                                               
3. Magnitude of poles and zeros: The ratio of the magnitude of a pole to its conjugate (complex conjugate) is used in the design criteria for feedback systems. A low value of   
this ratio indicates good stability properties.                                                                                                                                  
4. Sign of poles: Poles with negative real parts indicate instability, while those with positive real parts are stable.                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
In the context of your transfer function G(s), we can consider the following:                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Number of poles: 3 poles (real part > -2) and 1 pole (complex conjugate = -2). These poles have negative real parts, indicating stability within the LHP and potentially some 
instability near infinity or on imaginary axes.                                                                                                                                  
2. Location of poles: Poles at infinity and on an imaginary axis outside the LHP indicate instability. Poles near the origin may be unstable but do not affect stability beyond  
that point.                                                                                                                                                                      
3. Magnitude of poles: A low value of 0 dB indicates good stability properties, while values close to 1 or -1 may require further analysis.                                      
4. Sign of poles: Poles with negative real parts indicate instability, while those with positive real parts are stable.                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
To determine the stability of your feedback control system, you would need to examine the specific characteristics of the transfer function G(s) and compare them to these       
criteria to identify any potential issues or areas for improvement.

To analyze the stability of a feedback control system with transfer function G(s) = K/(s² + 3s + 2), we need to consider factors such as poles and zeros in the Laplace domain.  
The main components that determine a feedback system's stability are:                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Number of poles: A feedback system is considered stable if all its poles are located inside the unit circle (LHP). Poles outside the LHP indicate instability.                
2. Location of poles: Poles at infinity or on an imaginary axis can cause significant oscillations, while those near the origin may be unstable but do not affect stability      
beyond that point.                                                                                                                                                               
3. Magnitude of poles and zeros: The ratio of the magnitude of a pole to its conjugate (complex conjugate) is used in the design criteria for feedback systems. A low value of   
this ratio indicates good stability properties.                                                                                                                                  
4. Sign of poles: Poles with negative real parts indicate instability, while those with positive real parts are stable.                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
In the context of your transfer function G(s), we can consider the following:                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Number of poles: 3 poles (real part > -2) and 1 pole (complex conjugate = -2). These poles have negative real parts, indicating stability within the LHP and potentially some 
instability near infinity or on imaginary axes.                                                                                                                                  
2. Location of poles: Poles at infinity and on an imaginary axis outside the LHP indicate instability. Poles near the origin may be unstable but do not affect stability beyond  
that point.                                                                                                                                                                      
3. Magnitude of poles: A low value of 0 dB indicates good stability properties, while values close to 1 or -1 may require further analysis.                                      
4. Sign of poles: Poles with negative real parts indicate instability, while those with positive real parts are stable.                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
To determine the stability of your feedback control system, you would need to examine the specific characteristics of the transfer function G(s) and compare them to these       
criteria to identify any potential issues or areas for improvement.

To analyze the stability of a feedback control system with transfer function G(s) = K/(s² + 3s + 2), we need to consider factors such as poles and zeros in the Laplace domain.  
The main components that determine a feedback system's stability are:                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Number of poles: A feedback system is considered stable if all its poles are located inside the unit circle (LHP). Poles outside the LHP indicate instability.                
2. Location of poles: Poles at infinity or on an imaginary axis can cause significant oscillations, while those near the origin may be unstable but do not affect stability      
beyond that point.                                                                                                                                                               
3. Magnitude of poles and zeros: The ratio of the magnitude of a pole to its conjugate (complex conjugate) is used in the design criteria for feedback systems. A low value of   
this ratio indicates good stability properties.                                                                                                                                  
4. Sign of poles: Poles with negative real parts indicate instability, while those with positive real parts are stable.                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
In the context of your transfer function G(s), we can consider the following:                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Number of poles: 3 poles (real part > -2) and 1 pole (complex conjugate = -2). These poles have negative real parts, indicating stability within the LHP and potentially some 
instability near infinity or on imaginary axes.                                                                                                                                  
2. Location of poles: Poles at infinity and on an imaginary axis outside the LHP indicate instability. Poles near the origin may be unstable but do not affect stability beyond  
that point.                                                                                                                                                                      
3. Magnitude of poles: A low value of 0 dB indicates good stability properties, while values close to 1 or -1 may require further analysis.                                      
4. Sign of poles: Poles with negative real parts indicate instability, while those with positive real parts are stable.                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
To determine the stability of your feedback control system, you would need to examine the specific characteristics of the transfer function G(s) and compare them to these       
criteria to identify any potential issues or areas for improvement.

beyond that point.                                                                                                                                                               
3. Magnitude of poles and zeros: The ratio of the magnitude of a pole to its conjugate (complex conjugate) is used in the design criteria for feedback systems. A low value of   
this ratio indicates good stability properties.                                                                                                                                  
4. Sign of poles: Poles with negative real parts indicate instability, while those with positive real parts are stable.                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
In the context of your transfer function G(s), we can consider the following:                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Number of poles: 3 poles (real part > -2) and 1 pole (complex conjugate = -2). These poles have negative real parts, indicating stability within the LHP and potentially some 
instability near infinity or on imaginary axes.                                                                                                                                  
2. Location of poles: Poles at infinity and on an imaginary axis outside the LHP indicate instability. Poles near the origin may be unstable but do not affect stability beyond  
that point.                                                                                                                                                                      
3. Magnitude of poles: A low value of 0 dB indicates good stability properties, while values close to 1 or -1 may require further analysis.                                      
4. Sign of poles: Poles with negative real parts indicate instability, while those with positive real parts are stable.                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
To determine the stability of your feedback control system, you would need to examine the specific characteristics of the transfer function G(s) and compare them to these       
criteria to identify any potential issues or areas for improvement.

Output:
To determine the stability of a feedback control system with transfer function G(s) = K/(s² + 3s + 2), we need to consider factors such as poles and zeros in the Laplace domain. The main components that determine a feedback system's stability are:

1. Number of poles: A feedback system is considered stable if all its poles are located inside the unit circle (LHP). Poles outside the LHP indicate instability.
2. Location of poles: Poles at infinity or on an imaginary axis can cause significant oscillations, while those near the origin may be unstable but do not affect stability beyond that point.
3. Magnitude of poles and zeros: The ratio of the magnitude of a pole to its conjugate (complex conjugate) is used in the design criteria for feedback systems. A low value of this ratio indicates good stability properties.
4. Sign of poles: Poles with negative real parts indicate instability, while those with positive real parts are stable.

In the context of your transfer function G(s), we can consider the following:

1. Number of poles: 3 poles (real part > -2) and 1 pole (complex conjugate = -2). These poles have negative real parts, indicating stability within the LHP and potentially some instability near infinity or on imaginary axes.
2. Location of poles: Poles at infinity and on an imaginary axis outside the LHP indicate instability. Poles near the origin may be unstable but do not affect stability beyond that point.
3. Magnitude of poles: A low value of 0 dB indicates good stability properties, while values close to 1 or -1 may require further analysis.
4. Sign of poles: Poles with negative real parts indicate instability, while those with positive real parts are stable.

To determine the stability of your feedback control system, you would need to examine the specific characteristics of the transfer function G(s) and compare them to these criteria.
