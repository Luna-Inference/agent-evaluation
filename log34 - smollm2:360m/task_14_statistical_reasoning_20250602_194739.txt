This problem can be solved using combinatorics. Since each coin flip has two possible outcomes (heads or tails), we can consider this as a sequence of events with 2^5 = 32      
different outcomes, where 32 is the total number of ways to get exactly 3 heads out of 5 flips.                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
To calculate the probability, we divide the number of successful outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes:                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
32 successful outcomes / 32 possible outcomes                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
This equals 1/2^5 = 1/32 ≈ 0.028 or approximately 2.8%. So, there's about a 2.8% chance of getting exactly 3 heads when flipping a coin 5 times.

Output:
To find the probability of getting exactly 3 heads in 5 flips of a coin, we'll need to calculate the number of ways this can happen and divide it by the total number of possible outcomes.

1. First, let's calculate the total number of outcomes for 5 flips of a fair coin:
- Heads (H) or Tails (T): Each flip has two possibilities, so there are 2^5 = 32 possible outcomes in total (HHTTHTT).
2. Next, we'll count how many of these outcomes result in exactly 3 heads. There is one way for this to happen: HHTTHT or TTHHTT. This can be represented as 1/32 * 1 = 0.03125.
3. Finally, to find the probability, we'll divide the number of favorable outcomes (getting exactly 3 heads) by the total number of possible outcomes: 
   Probability = Number of Favorable Outcomes / Total Number of Outcomes
   Probability = 0.03125 / 32
   Probability ≈ 0.001092

So, the probability of getting exactly 3 heads in 5 flips of a fair coin is approximately 0.001092 or 0.109%.

Task 14 complete.
