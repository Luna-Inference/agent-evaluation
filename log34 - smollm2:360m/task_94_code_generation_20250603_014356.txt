3. Create a `main` method where you can test your implementation by calling the appropriate functions provided in the code snippet, like getting an item from the cache or       
removing a key-value pair, and checking if it is valid.

task of implementing an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache in Java with generic type support and optimal time complexity using this code, you can follow these steps:

1. Define a class called `LRUCache` as mentioned in the instruction, which will have methods to get/set items from/to the cache, add new items to/remove items from the cache, 
get the size of the cache, and return the value associated with the key.
2. Implement the `get`, `put`, `size()`, and `getRandomIndexFromQueue` methods as per the given code snippet.
3. Create a `main` method where you can test your implementation by calling the appropriate functions provided in the code snippet, like getting an item from the cache or 
removing a key-value pair, and checking if it is valid.
            Make sure to include code with the correct pattern, for instance:

implementing an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache in Java with generic type support and optimal time complexity using this code, you can follow these steps:                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Define a class called `LRUCache` as mentioned in the instruction, which will have methods to get/set items from/to the cache, add new items to/remove items from the cache,   
get the size of the cache, and return the value associated with the key.                                                                                                         
2. Implement the `get`, `put`, `size()`, and `getRandomIndexFromQueue` methods as per the given code snippet.                                                                    
3. Create a `main` method where you can test your implementation by calling the appropriate functions provided in the code snippet, like getting an item from the cache or       
removing a key-value pair, and checking if it is valid.

```

This implementation uses a combination of `Lock` and `Condition` classes to achieve thread-safety and handle shared resources such as the cache and condition signals. The LRU behavior is implemented using a sliding window approach where the oldest element in the queue (i.e., the least recently used item) is removed from the cache when its value exceeds a threshold, ensuring that elements are evicted only when necessary.

Task 94 complete.
