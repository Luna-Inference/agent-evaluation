To factor the given polynomial x³ - 6x² + 11x - 6, we need to find two numbers whose product is -6 and whose sum is -(-6). These are -2 and -3.

(x - 2)(x - 3) = (x - 2)(x² + x + 3) = x³ - 2x² - 3x² - 6x + 9 = x³ - 5x² + 11x - 6.

(x - 2)(x - 3) = (x - 2)(x² + x + 3) = x³ - 2x² - 3x² - 6x + 9 = x³ - 5x² + 11x - 6.
