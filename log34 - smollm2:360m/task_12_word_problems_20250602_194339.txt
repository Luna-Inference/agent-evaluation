To find out how long each pipe takes to fill the pool, we need to use the given information and analyze it step-by-step.                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Let's denote the number of gallons of water in the pool as 'x'. Since the first pipe alone fills the pool in 4 hours (6 hours longer than the second pipe), its rate is 1/4      
gallons per hour.                                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The total capacity of the pool is 240 gallons, so we can set up a proportion to find the rates of both pipes:                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1/(4) = x / 240                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Cross-multiplying gives us:                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3x = 240                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now, divide by 3 to solve for 'x':                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
x = 80 gallons per hour                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So, each pipe can fill the pool in 80 hours.

            To find out how long each pipe takes to fill the pool, we need to use the given information and analyze it step-by-step. 

Let's denote the number of gallons of water in the pool as 'x'. Since the first pipe alone fills the pool in 4 hours (6 hours longer than the second pipe), its rate is 1/4 
gallons per hour. 

The total capacity of the pool is 240 gallons, so we can set up a proportion to find the rates of both pipes:

1/(4) = x / 240

Cross-multiplying gives us:

3x = 240

Now, divide by 3 to solve for 'x':

x = 80 gallons per hour

So, each pipe can fill the pool in 80 hours.

Cross-multiplying gives us:

Now, divide by 3 to solve for 'x':

So, each pipe can fill the pool in 80 hours.

            Here is your code snippet:
            To find out how long each pipe takes to fill the pool, we need to use the given information and analyze it step-by-step. 

Let's denote the number of gallons of water in the pool as 'x'. Since the first pipe alone fills the pool in 4 hours (6 hours longer than the second pipe), its rate is 1/4 
gallons per hour.

The total capacity of the pool is 240 gallons, so we can set up a proportion to find the rates of both pipes:

1/(4) = x / 240

Cross-multiplying gives us:

3x = 240

Now, divide by 3 to solve for 'x':

x = 80 gallons per hour

So, each pipe can fill the pool in 80 hours.

            Here is your code snippet:
            To find out how long each pipe takes to fill the pool, we need to use the given information and analyze it step-by-step. 

Let's denote the number of gallons of water in the pool as 'x'. Since the first pipe alone fills the pool in 4 hours (6 hours longer than the second pipe), its rate is 1/4 
gallons per hour.

The total capacity of the pool is 240 gallons, so we can set up a proportion to find the rates of both pipes:

1/(4) = x / 240

Cross-multiplying gives us:

3x = 240

Now, divide by 3 to solve for 'x':

x = 80 gallons per hour

So, each pipe can fill the pool in 80 hours.

            To find out how long each pipe takes to fill the pool, we need to use the given information and analyze it step-by-step. 

Let's denote the number of gallons of water in the pool as 'x'. Since the first pipe alone fills the pool in 4 hours (6 hours longer than the second pipe), its rate is 1/4 
gallons per hour.

The total capacity of the pool is 240 gallons, so we can set up a proportion to find the rates of both pipes:

1/(4) = x / 240

Cross-multiplying gives us:

3x = 240

Now, divide by 3 to solve for 'x':

x = 80 gallons per hour

So, each pipe can fill the pool in 80 hours.

To find out how long each pipe takes to fill the pool, we need to use the given information and analyze it step-by-step.                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Let's denote the number of gallons of water in the pool as 'x'. Since the first pipe alone fills the pool in 4 hours (6 hours longer than the second pipe), its rate is 1/4      
gallons per hour.                                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The total capacity of the pool is 240 gallons, so we can set up a proportion to find the rates of both pipes:                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1/(4) = x / 240                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Cross-multiplying gives us:                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3x = 240                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now, divide by 3 to solve for 'x':                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
x = 80 gallons per hour                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So, each pipe can fill the pool in 80 hours.

Cross-multiplying gives us:                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3x = 240                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now, divide by 3 to solve for 'x':                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
x = 80 gallons per hour                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So, each pipe can fill the pool in 80 hours.

            Here is your code snippet:
            To find out how long each pipe takes to fill the pool, we need to use the given information and analyze it step-by-step. 

Let's denote the number of gallons of water in the pool as 'x'. Since the first pipe alone fills the pool in 4 hours (6 hours longer than the second pipe), its rate is 1/4 
gallons per hour.

The total capacity of the pool is 240 gallons, so we can set up a proportion to find the rates of both pipes:

1/(4) = x / 240

Cross-multiplying gives us:

3x = 240

Now, divide by 3 to solve for 'x':

x = 80 gallons per hour

So, each pipe can fill the pool in 80 hours.

            Here is your code snippet:
            To find out how long each pipe takes to fill the pool, we need to use the given information and analyze it step-by-step. 

Let's denote the number of gallons of water in the pool as 'x'. Since the first pipe alone fills the pool in 4 hours (6 hours longer than the second pipe), its rate is 1/4 
gallons per hour.

The total capacity of the pool is 240 gallons, so we can set up a proportion to find the rates of both pipes:

1/(4) = x / 240

Cross-multiplying gives us:

3x = 240

Now, divide by 3 to solve for 'x':

x = 80 gallons per hour

So, each pipe can fill the pool in 80 hours.

            To find out how long each pipe takes to fill the pool, we need to use the given information and analyze it step-by-step. 

Let's denote the number of gallons of water in the pool as 'x'. Since the first pipe alone fills the pool in 4 hours (6 hours longer than the second pipe), its rate is 1/4 
gallons per hour.

The total capacity of the pool is 240 gallons, so we can set up a proportion to find the rates of both pipes:

1/(4) = x / 240

Cross-multiplying gives us:

3x = 240

Now, divide by 3 to solve for 'x':

x = 80 gallons per hour

So, each pipe can fill the pool in 80 hours.

            To find out how long each pipe takes to fill the pool, we need to use the given information and analyze it step-by-step. 

Let's denote the number of gallons of water in the pool as 'x'. Since the first pipe alone fills the pool in 4 hours (6 hours longer than the second pipe), its rate is 1/4 
gallons per hour.

The total capacity of the pool is 240 gallons, so we can set up a proportion to find the rates of both pipes:

1/(4) = x / 240

Cross-multiplying gives us:

3x = 240

Now, divide by 3 to solve for 'x':

x = 80 gallons per hour

So, each pipe can fill the pool in 80 hours.

Output:
To find out how long it would take each pipe individually, we need to set up the proportion of work that each pipe is doing and then solve for each individual time.

We know that the first pipe alone fills the pool in 4 hours (6 hours longer than the second pipe). So, the ratio of work done by the first pipe to the total amount of water in the pool can be represented as:

(1/4) = x / 240

Now, we want to find out how long it would take each pipe individually. We can do this by solving for x (the rate at which the second pipe fills the pool). 

x = (1/4) * 240
x = 60

So, it would take the first pipe, alone, 60 hours to fill the pool.

Similarly, we can calculate the time for each of the two pipes individually:

The second pipe takes 60 - (6 + 1) = 48 hours to fill the pool (since it works 6 hours longer than the first).

Therefore, each of the two pipes would take 24 hours to fill the pool individually.

Task 12 complete.
