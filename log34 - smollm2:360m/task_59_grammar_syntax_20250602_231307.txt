Here are some examples with the distinction explained for you:                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. "The teacher gave the students a lot of homework." (Restrictive relative clause)                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
A restrictive relative clause is one that provides essential information about the noun it modifies, and without it, the sentence would be incomplete or confusing. In this      
example, we know that there are only 20 people in the class, so we need to know whether they're all of the same gender or not. Therefore, "a lot" is a restrictive relative      
clause because its inclusion makes the sentence grammatically correct and complete.                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. "The students were given a lot of homework." (Non-restrictive relative clause)                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
In contrast, a non-restrictive relative clause is one that provides extra information about the noun it modifies without affecting the essential meaning of the sentence. In this
example, we know that there are 20 students in the class, but we don't necessarily care whether they're all male or female. Therefore, "a lot" is not a restrictive relative     
clause because its inclusion does not make the sentence grammatically correct and complete. Instead, it provides additional information about the noun (students) without        
affecting the essential meaning of the original sentence.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So, in summary: If you can remove the word from the sentence without changing its meaning or making it incomplete, use a restrictive relative clause; if not, use a              
non-restrictive relative clause.

Restrictive relative clause vs Non-restrictive relative clause                                                                                                                   
The key to understanding this distinction lies in the meaning of each type of relative clause. Here are some differences you might want to consider:

When to use each type:                                                                                                                                                           
1. Use restrictive relative clauses when you need to provide essential information about the noun and make sure it's accurate.                                                   
   Example: "The company is headquartered in [city]." Here, "the company" is a singular subject that requires an essential phrase like "in [city]" to be grammatically correct.  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. Use non-restrictive relative clauses when you want to add additional information about the noun without affecting its meaning.                                                
   Example: "The students studied for three hours before the exam." Here, we don't need to know their gender or other details, so an extra phrase like "before the exam" is      
useful but not necessary.                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
In summary, use restrictive relative clauses when you have some additional information that's relevant and accurate about a noun, while non-restrictive ones are used for extra  
information without changing the essential meaning of the sentence. This distinction helps in making your writing more precise and clear.

other details.                                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
When to use each type:                                                                                                                                                           
1. Use restrictive relative clauses when you need to provide essential information about the noun and make sure it's accurate.                                                   
   Example: "The company is headquartered in [city]." Here, "the company" is a singular subject that requires an essential phrase like "in [city]" to be grammatically correct.  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. Use non-restrictive relative clauses when you want to add additional information about the noun without affecting its meaning.                                                
   Example: "The students studied for three hours before the exam." Here, we don't need to know their gender or other details, so an extra phrase like "before the exam" is      
useful but not necessary.                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
In summary, use restrictive relative clauses when you have some additional information that's relevant and accurate about a noun, while non-restrictive ones are used for extra  
information without changing the essential meaning of the sentence. This distinction helps in making your writing more precise and clear.

Task: "Explain the difference between restrictive and non-restrictive relative clauses using these examples."

Restrictive relative clause vs Non-restrictive relative clause
The key to understanding this distinction lies in the meaning of each type of relative clause. Here are some differences you might want to consider:

1. Essential Information: A restrictive relative clause is one that provides essential information about the noun it modifies, which means we know that it's true without adding 
any other information. For example, "The teacher gave the students a lot of homework." This clause tells us that there are only 20 students in the class, so we can conclude that
they're all male or female.

2. Extra Information: A non-restrictive relative clause is one that provides extra information about the noun it modifies without affecting the essential meaning of the 
sentence. For example, "The students were given a lot of homework." This clause tells us that there are 20 students in the class, but we don't necessarily know their gender or 
other details.

When to use each type: 
1. Use restrictive relative clauses when you need to provide essential information about the noun and make sure it's accurate.
   Example: "The company is headquartered in [city\]." Here, "the company" is a singular subject that requires an essential phrase like "in [city\]" to be grammatically correct.

2. Use non-restrictive relative clauses when you want to add additional information about the noun without affecting its meaning.
   Example: "The students studied for three hours before the exam." Here, we don't need to know their gender or other details, so an extra phrase like "before the exam" is 
useful but not necessary.

In summary, use restrictive relative clauses when you have some additional information that's relevant and accurate about a noun, while non-restrictive ones are used for extra 
information without changing the essential meaning of the sentence. This distinction helps in making your writing more precise and clear.

they're all male or female.                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. Extra Information: A non-restrictive relative clause is one that provides extra information about the noun it modifies without affecting the essential meaning of the         
sentence. For example, "The students were given a lot of homework." This clause tells us that there are 20 students in the class, but we don't necessarily know their gender or  
other details.                                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
When to use each type:                                                                                                                                                           
1. Use restrictive relative clauses when you need to provide essential information about the noun and make sure it's accurate.                                                   
   Example: "The company is headquartered in [city]." Here, "the company" is a singular subject that requires an essential phrase like "in [city]" to be grammatically correct.  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. Use non-restrictive relative clauses when you want to add extra information about the noun without affecting its meaning.                                                     
   Example: "The students studied for three hours before the exam." Here, we don't need to know their gender or other details, so an extra phrase like "before the exam" is      
useful but not necessary.                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
In summary, use restrictive relative clauses when you have some additional information that's relevant and accurate about a noun, while non-restrictive ones are used for extra  
information without changing the essential meaning of the sentence. This distinction helps in making your writing more precise and clear.

   Example: "The company is headquartered in [city]." Here, "the company" is a singular subject that requires an essential phrase like "in [city]" to be grammatically correct.  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. Use non-restrictive relative clauses when you want to add extra information about the noun without affecting its meaning.                                                     
   Example: "The students studied for three hours before the exam." Here, we don't need to know their gender or other details, so an extra phrase like "before the exam" is      
useful but not necessary.                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
In summary, use restrictive relative clauses when you have some additional information that's relevant and accurate about a noun, while non-restrictive ones are used for extra  
information without changing the essential meaning of the sentence. This distinction helps in making your writing more precise and clear.

Task: "Explain the difference between restrictive and non-restrictive relative clauses using these examples."

Restrictive relative clause vs Non-restrictive relative clause
The key to understanding this distinction lies in the meaning of each type of relative clause. Here are some differences you might want to consider:

1. Essential Information: A restrictive relative clause is one that provides essential information about the noun it modifies, which means we know that it's true without adding 
any other information. For example, "The teacher gave the students a lot of homework." This clause tells us that there are only 20 students in the class, so we can conclude that
they're all male or female.

2. Extra Information: A non-restrictive relative clause is one that provides extra information about the noun it modifies without affecting the essential meaning of the 
sentence. For example, "The students were given a lot of homework." This clause tells us that there are 20 students in the class, but we don't necessarily know their gender or 
other details.

When to use each type: 
1. Use restrictive relative clauses when you need to provide essential information about the noun and make sure it's accurate.
   Example: "The company is headquartered in [city\]." Here, "the company" is a singular subject that requires an essential phrase like "in [city\]" to be grammatically correct.

2. Use non-restrictive relative clauses when you want to add extra information about the noun without affecting its meaning.
   Example: "The students studied for three hours before the exam." Here, we don't need to know their gender or other details, so an extra phrase like "before the exam" is 
useful but not necessary.

In summary, use restrictive relative clauses when you have some additional information that's relevant and accurate about a noun, while non-restrictive ones are used for extra 
information without changing the essential meaning of the sentence. This distinction helps in making your writing more precise and clear.

useful but not necessary.                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
In summary, use restrictive relative clauses when you have some additional information that's relevant and accurate about a noun, while non-restrictive ones are used for extra

Task: "Explain the difference between restrictive and non-restrictive relative clauses using these examples."

Restrictive relative clause vs Non-restrictive relative clause
The key to understanding this distinction lies in the meaning of each type of relative clause. Here are some differences you might want to consider:

1. Essential Information: A restrictive relative clause is one that provides essential information about the noun it modifies, which means we know that it's true without adding 
any other information. For example, "The teacher gave the students a lot of homework." This clause tells us that there are only 20 students in the class, so we can conclude that
they're all male or female.

2. Extra Information: A non-restrictive relative clause is one that provides extra information about the noun it modifies without affecting the essential meaning of the 
sentence. For example, "The students were given a lot of homework." This clause tells us that there are 20 students in the class, but we don't necessarily know their gender or 
other details.

When to use each type: 
1. Use restrictive relative clauses when you need to provide essential information about the noun and make sure it's accurate.
   Example: "The company is headquartered in [city\]." Here, "the company" is a singular subject that requires an essential phrase like "in [city\]" to be grammatically correct.

2. Use non-restrictive relative clauses when you want to add extra information about the noun without affecting its meaning.
   Example: "The students studied for three hours before the exam." Here, we don't need to know their gender or other details, so an extra phrase like "before the exam" is 
useful but not necessary.

In summary, use restrictive relative clauses when you have some additional information that's relevant and accurate about a noun, while non-restrictive ones are used for extra 
information without changing the essential meaning of the sentence.

1. Use restrictive relative clauses when you need to provide essential information about the noun and make sure it's accurate.
   Example: "The company is headquartered in [city\]." Here, "the company" is a singular subject that requires an essential phrase like "in [city\]" to be grammatically correct.

2. Use non-restrictive relative clauses when you want to add extra information about the noun without affecting its meaning.
   Example: "The students studied for three hours before the exam." Here, we don't need to know their gender or other details so an extra phrase like "before the exam" is useful
but not necessary.

In summary, use restrictive relative clauses when you have some additional information that's relevant and accurate about a noun, while non-restrictive ones are used for extra 
information without changing the essential meaning of the sentence.

The key to understanding this distinction lies in the meaning of each type of relative clause. Here are some differences you might want to consider:                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Essential Information: A restrictive relative clause is one that provides essential information about the noun it modifies, which means we know that it's true without adding 
any other information. For example, "The teacher gave the students a lot of homework." This clause tells us that there are only 20 students in the class, so we can conclude that
they're all male or female.                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. Extra Information: A non-restrictive relative clause is one that provides extra information about the noun it modifies without affecting the essential meaning of the         
sentence. For example, "The students were given a lot of homework." This clause tells us that there are 20 students in the class but we don't necessarily know their gender or   
other details.

Restrictive relative clause vs Non-restrictive relative clause                                                                                                                   
The key to understanding this distinction lies in the meaning of each type of relative clause. Here are some differences you might want to consider:                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Essential Information: A restrictive relative clause is one that provides essential information about the noun it modifies, which means we know that it's true without adding 
any other information. For example, "The teacher gave the students a lot of homework." This clause tells us that there are only 20 students in the class, so we can conclude that
they're all male or female.                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. Extra Information: A non-restrictive relative clause is one that provides extra information about the noun it modifies without affecting the essential meaning of the         
sentence. For example, "The students were given a lot of homework." This clause tells us that there are 20 students in the class but we don't necessarily know their gender or   
other details.                                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
When to use each type:                                                                                                                                                           
1. Use restrictive relative clauses when you need to provide essential information about the noun and make sure it's accurate.                                                   
   Example: "The company is headquartered in [city]." Here, "the company" is a singular subject that requires an essential phrase like "in [city]" to be grammatically correct.  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. Use non-restrictive relative clauses when you want to add extra information about the noun without affecting its meaning.                                                     
   Example: "The students studied for three hours before the exam." Here, we don't need to know their gender or other details so an extra phrase like "before the exam" is useful
but not necessary.                                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
In summary, use restrictive relative clauses when you have some additional information that's relevant and accurate about a noun, while non-restrictive ones are used for extra  
information without changing the essential meaning of the sentence.

1. Essential Information: A restrictive relative clause is one that provides essential information about the noun it modifies, which means we know that it's true without adding 
any other information. For example, "The teacher gave the students a lot of homework." This clause tells us that there are only 20 students in the class, so we can conclude that
they're all male or female.                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. Extra Information: A non-restrictive relative clause is one that provides extra information about the noun it modifies without affecting the essential meaning of the         
sentence. For example, "The students were given a lot of homework." This clause tells us that there are 20 students in the class but we don't necessarily know their gender or   
other details.                                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
When to use each type:                                                                                                                                                           
1. Use restrictive relative clauses when you need to provide essential information about the noun and make sure it's accurate.                                                   
   Example: "The company is headquartered in [city]." Here, "the company" is a singular subject that requires an essential phrase like "in [city]" to be grammatically correct.  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. Use non-restrictive relative clauses when you want to add extra information about the noun without affecting its meaning.                                                     
   Example: "The students studied for three hours before the exam." Here, we don't need to know their gender or other details so an extra phrase like "before the exam" is useful
but not necessary.                                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
In summary, use restrictive relative clauses when you have some additional information that's relevant and accurate about a noun, while non-restrictive ones are used for extra  
information without changing the essential meaning of the sentence.

other details.                                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
When to use each type:

   Example: "The company is headquartered in [city]." Here, "the company" is a singular subject that requires an essential phrase like "in [city]" to be grammatically correct.  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. Use non-restrictive relative clauses when you want to add extra information about the noun without affecting its meaning.                                                     
   Example: "The students studied for three hours before the exam." Here, we don't need to know their gender or other details so an extra phrase like "before the exam" is useful
but not necessary.                                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
In summary, use restrictive relative clauses when you have some additional information that's relevant and accurate about a noun, while non-restrictive ones are used for extra  
information without changing the essential meaning of the sentence.

Task: "Explain the difference between restrictive and non-restrictive relative clauses using these examples."

Restrictive relative clause vs Non-restrictive relative clause
The key to understanding this distinction lies in the meaning of each type of relative clause. Here are some differences you might want to consider:

1. Essential Information: A restrictive relative clause is one that provides essential information about the noun it modifies, which means we know that it's true without adding 
any other information. For example, "The teacher gave the students a lot of homework." This clause tells us that there are only 20 students in the class, so we can conclude that
they're all male or female.

2. Extra Information: A non-restrictive relative clause is one that provides extra information about the noun it modifies without affecting the essential meaning of the 
sentence. For example, "The students were given a lot of homework." This clause tells us that there are 20 students in the class but we don't necessarily know their gender or 
other details.

When to use each type: 
1. Use restrictive relative clauses when you need to provide essential information about the noun and make sure it's accurate.
   Example: "The company is headquartered in [city\]." Here, "the company" is a singular subject that requires an essential phrase like "in [city\]" to be grammatically correct.

2. Use non-restrictive relative clauses when you want to add extra information about the noun without affecting its meaning.
   Example: "The students studied for three hours before the exam." Here, we don't need to know their gender or other details so an extra phrase like "before the exam" is useful
but not necessary.

In summary, use restrictive relative clauses when you have some additional information that's relevant and accurate about a noun, while non-restrictive ones are used for extra 
information without changing the essential meaning of the sentence.

2. Use non-restrictive relative clauses when you want to add extra information about the noun without affecting its meaning.                                                     
   Example: "The students studied for three hours before the exam." Here, we don't need to know their gender or other details so an extra phrase like "before the exam" is useful
but not necessary.                                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
In summary, use restrictive relative clauses when you have some additional information that's relevant and accurate about a noun, while non-restrictive ones are used for extra  
information without changing the essential meaning of the sentence.

Task: "Explain the difference between restrictive and non-restrictive relative clauses using these examples."

Restrictive relative clause vs Non-restrictive relative clause
The key to understanding this distinction lies in the meaning of each type of relative clause. Here are some differences you might want to consider:

1. Essential Information: A restrictive relative clause is one that provides essential information about the noun it modifies, which means we know that it's true without adding 
any other information. For example, "The teacher gave the students a lot of homework." This clause tells us that there are only 20 students in the class, so we can conclude that
they're all male or female.

2. Extra Information: A non-restrictive relative clause is one that provides extra information about the noun it modifies without affecting the essential meaning of the 
sentence. For example, "The students were given a lot of homework." This clause tells us that there are 20 students in the class but we don't necessarily know their gender or 
other details.

When to use each type: 
1. Use restrictive relative clauses when you need to provide essential information about the noun and make sure it's accurate.
   Example: "The company is headquartered in [city\]." Here, "the company" is a singular subject that requires an essential phrase like "in [city\]" to be grammatically correct.

2. Use non-restrictive relative clauses when you want to add extra information about the noun without affecting its meaning.
   Example: "The students studied for three hours before the exam." Here, we don't need to know their gender or other details so an extra phrase like "before the exam" is useful
but not necessary.

In summary, use restrictive relative clauses when you have some additional information that's relevant and accurate about a noun, while non-restrictive ones are used for extra 
information without changing the essential meaning of the sentence.
            Make sure to include code with the correct pattern, for instance:
            Thoughts: Your thoughts
            Code:
            ```py
            # Your python code here
            ```<end_code>
Make sure to provide correct code blobs.
