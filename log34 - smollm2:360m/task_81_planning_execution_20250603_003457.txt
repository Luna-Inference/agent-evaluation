Sure, here is a step-by-step plan to organize a $500-budget surprise birthday party for 20 friends and family members:                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
**Step 1: Choose a Date and Time**                                                                                                                                               
Decide on the date and time that works best for you. A weekend evening or late afternoon would be ideal since it is the start of a new year, which could help to build excitement
among your guests. Also consider what time will keep everyone quiet until the party starts as loud noises may disturb others. Choose 2-3 hours before your friends and family are
expected to leave for dinner or after their night out with friends.                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
**Step 2: Finalize Guest List and Reservations**                                                                                                                                 
Once you have decided on a date, finalize who will be attending the party. Make sure they are all close to 18 years old so it is not too difficult to handle them during the     
party. You also need to contact local venues that can accommodate your guests in a private area of the house or event space and reserve an empty room for two nights at least.   
Check availability, check if rooms are booked by the venue and have enough time to secure the date without disappointing the guests.                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
**Step 3: Plan the Party Logistics**                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Create Guest List: You should create a list of all your guests so you can communicate with them and ensure there is not any misunderstanding or confusion about who will be   
attending. This can be done by creating an email template and sending it out to all your friends and family members in advance, ideally 2-3 weeks before the party.              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. Set Up Decorations: Decide on decorations that you like such as balloons, banners, flowers, etc., and set up these for the party area where guests will be seated or standing 
at the entrance to the venue. You can also set up a photo booth if you have space.                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3. Choose Vessel: A table with a bar and food stations is ideal for serving your friends and family as there is plenty of seating on each table, thus allowing everyone to dine  
comfortably without having to stand. You might want to consider a buffet service at the start of the party to allow guests to pick what they like.                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
4. Plan for Food: Determine how many meals are needed for your guests based on their number and dietary needs. Choose catering if possible, or you can do it yourself by         
preparing food in advance that is easy to serve as a potluck. It's also important to note that everyone must take a turn at eating during the party so make sure there is plenty 
of seating available.                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
5. Arrange for Games: Depending on the number of guests and your preferences, you can have games or activities to keep people entertained throughout the party. This could be    
anything from simple quizzes to games like Scrabble or card games if they are allowed.                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
6. Set Up Tables, Chairs, and Equipment: Ensure that all tables, chairs, and food stations are clean and set up so guests do not accidentally break things during the party. You 
should also make sure there is a place for drinks such as glasses and a few bottles of water or other beverages.                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
7. Prepare Food and Wine: This includes setting up serving dishes, utensils, napkins, etc. You might want to have food that guests can eat on their own at different stations    
throughout the party if you are doing some cooking in advance. The same goes for wine - it should be served out of a pitcher or decanter as opposed to glasses to avoid spilling.
                                                                                                                                                                                 
8. Set Up the Sound System: If your venue allows, you might want to set up some music or a DJ to keep the party going. You can also have some background noise if possible to    
make the space more inviting and comfortable for guests.                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
9. Organize Storage Space: It's crucial that there is enough storage space available in any given area of the room at all times as you might be hosting a large number of guests.
If possible, use storage containers or bins to store food and drinks when they are not being served.                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
**Step 4: Plan for Party Activities and Entertainment**                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Create Music: Create some music that your guests can enjoy without it seeming too loud. You don't need anything extremely complex but just a good mix of different genres to  
keep the party interesting.                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. Set Up Games or Activities: Depending on the number of guests, there are many fun activities you could set up throughout the day. This could be anything from a photo booth   
with silly pictures for each guest to create a funny picture collage, or games such as 'Guess Who' where guests have to guess who is sitting in their seat when they hear their  
name called.                                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3. Play Music: During the party, ensure that you keep music playing at different levels so people can get used to the loud sound. Keep some soft background music going if       
possible for a while after the main part of the party.                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
4. Have 'The Talk': In advance, prepare your guests and encourage them to have an open conversation with each other about what they expect and are excited about this event. It  
might be as simple as asking about plans for their anniversary or wishing them all a happy birthday on the big day.                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
**Step 5: Finalize Setup and Clean Up**                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Set Up Tables, Chairs, and Equipment: Check that everything is in place before guests start arriving and get set to eat and drink. This includes decorations if you chose to  
put up ones such as balloons or banners.                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. Clean Up: Finally, after the party is over, ensure that all food waste is disposed of properly and any mess left on tables are cleaned up promptly.                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
With these steps, it should be easy for you to organize a surprise birthday party for your friends and family members within your budget of $500.

            Sure, here is a step-by-step plan to organize a $500-budget surprise birthday party for 20 friends and family members:

**Step 1: Choose a Date and Time**
Decide on the date and time that works best for you. A weekend evening or late afternoon would be ideal since it is the start of a new year, which could help to build excitement
among your guests. Also consider what time will keep everyone quiet until the party starts as loud noises may disturb others. Choose 2-3 hours before your friends and family are
expected to leave for dinner or after their night out with friends.

**Step 2: Finalize Guest List and Reservations**
Once you have decided on a date, finalize who will be attending the party. Make sure they are all close to 18 years old so it is not too difficult to handle them during the 
party. You also need to contact local venues that can accommodate your guests in a private area of the house or event space and reserve an empty room for two nights at least. 
Check availability, check if rooms are booked by the venue and have enough time to secure the date without disappointing the guests.

**Step 3: Plan the Party Logistics**

1. Create Guest List: You should create a list of all your guests so you can communicate with them and ensure there is not any misunderstanding or confusion about who will be 
attending. This can be done by creating an email template and sending it out to all your friends and family members in advance, ideally 2-3 weeks before the party.

2. Set Up Decorations: Decide on decorations that you like such as balloons, banners, flowers, etc., and set up these for the party area where guests will be seated or standing 
at the entrance to the venue. You can also set up a photo booth if you have space.

3. Choose Vessel: A table with a bar and food stations is ideal for serving your friends and family as there is plenty of seating on each table, thus allowing everyone to dine 
comfortably without having to stand. You might want to consider a buffet service at the start of the party to allow guests to pick what they like.

4. Plan for Food: Determine how many meals are needed for your guests based on their number and dietary needs. Choose catering if possible, or you can do it yourself by 
preparing food in advance that is easy to serve as a potluck. It's also important to note that everyone must take a turn at eating during the party so make sure there is plenty 
of seating available.

5. Arrange for Games: Depending on the number of guests and your preferences, you can have games or activities to keep people entertained throughout the party. This could be 
anything from simple quizzes to games like Scrabble or card games if they are allowed.

6. Set Up Tables, Chairs, and Equipment: Ensure that all tables, chairs, and food stations are clean and set up so guests do not accidentally break things during the party. You 
should also make sure there is a place for drinks such as glasses and a few bottles of water or other beverages.

7. Prepare Food and Wine: This includes setting up serving dishes, utensils, napkins, etc. You might want to have food that guests can eat on their own at different stations 
throughout the party if you are doing some cooking in advance. The same goes for wine - it should be served out of a pitcher or decanter as opposed to glasses to avoid spilling.

8. Set Up the Sound System: If your venue allows, you might want to set up some music or a DJ to keep the party going. You can also have some background noise if possible to 
make the space more inviting and comfortable for guests.

9. Organize Storage Space: It's crucial that there is enough storage space available in any given area of the room at all times as you might be hosting a large number of guests.
If possible, use storage containers or bins to store food and drinks when they are not being served.

**Step 4: Plan for Party Activities and Entertainment**

1. Create Music: Create some music that your guests can enjoy without it seeming too loud. You don't need anything extremely complex but just a good mix of different genres to 
keep the party interesting.

2. Set Up Games or Activities: Depending on the number of guests, there are many fun activities you could set up throughout the day. This could be anything from a photo booth 
with silly pictures for each guest to create a funny picture collage, or games such as 'Guess Who' where guests have to guess who is sitting in their seat when they hear their 
name called.

3. Play Music: During the party, ensure that you keep music playing at different levels so people can get used to the loud sound. Keep some soft background music going if 
possible for a while after the main part of the party.

4. Have 'The Talk': In advance, prepare your guests and encourage them to have an open conversation with each other about what they expect and are excited about this event. It 
might be as simple as asking about plans for their anniversary or wishing them all a happy birthday on the big day.

**Step 5: Finalize Setup and Clean Up**

1. Set Up Tables, Chairs, and Equipment: Check that everything is in place before guests start arriving and get set to eat and drink. This includes decorations if you chose to 
put up ones such as balloons or banners. 

2. Clean Up: Finally, after the party is over, ensure that all food waste is disposed of properly and any mess left on tables are cleaned up promptly.

With these steps, it should be easy for you to organize a surprise birthday party for your friends and family members within your budget of $500.

Sure, here is the step-by-step plan to organize a $500-budget surprise birthday party for 20 friends and family members without repeating past code errors:                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
**Step 1: Choose a Date and Time**                                                                                                                                               
Decide on the date and time that works best for you. A weekend evening or late afternoon would be ideal since it is the start of a new year, which could help to build excitement
among your guests. Also consider what time will keep everyone quiet until the party starts as loud noises may disturb others. Choose 2-3 hours before your friends and family are
expected to leave for dinner or after their night out with friends.                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
**Step 2: Finalize Guest List and Reservations**                                                                                                                                 
Once you have decided on a date, finalize who will be attending the party. Make sure they are all close to 18 years old so it is not too difficult to handle them during the     
party if there's no one older than them who might start behaving badly. You also need to contact local venues that can accommodate your guests in a private area of the house or 
event space and reserve an empty room for two nights at least. Check availability, check if rooms are booked by the venue and have enough time to secure the date without

            Sure, here is the step-by-step plan to organize a $500-budget surprise birthday party for 20 friends and family members without repeating past code errors:

**Step 1: Choose a Date and Time**
Decide on the date and time that works best for you. A weekend evening or late afternoon would be ideal since it is the start of a new year, which could help to build excitement
among your guests. Also consider what time will keep everyone quiet until the party starts as loud noises may disturb others. Choose 2-3 hours before your friends and family are
expected to leave for dinner or after their night out with friends.

**Step 2: Finalize Guest List and Reservations**
Once you have decided on a date, finalize who will be attending the party. Make sure they are all close to 18 years old so it is not too difficult to handle them during the 
party if there's no one older than them who might start behaving badly. You also need to contact local venues that can accommodate your guests in a private area of the house or 
event space and reserve an empty room for two nights at least. Check availability, check if rooms are booked by the venue and have enough time to secure the date without 
disappointing the guests.

**Step 3: Plan the Party Logistics**

1. Create Guest List: You should create a list of all your guests so you can communicate with them and ensure there is not any misunderstanding or confusion about who will be 
attending. This can be done by creating an email template and sending it out to all your friends and family members in advance, ideally 2-3 weeks before the party.

2. Set Up Decorations: Decide on decorations that you like such as balloons, banners, flowers, etc., and set up these for the party area where guests will be seated or standing 
at the entrance to the venue. You might want to consider a buffet service at the start of the party to allow guests to pick what they like.

3. Choose Vessel: A table with a bar and food stations is ideal for serving your friends and family as there is plenty of seating on each table, thus allowing everyone to dine 
comfortably without having to stand. You might want to consider a buffet service at the start of the party or have some background noise if possible to make the space more 
inviting and comfortable for guests.

4. Plan for Food: Determine how many meals are needed for your guests based on their number and dietary needs. Choose catering if you prefer cooking in advance, or you can do it
yourself by preparing food in advance that is easy to serve as a potluck. It's also important to note that everyone must take a turn at eating during the party so make sure 
there is plenty of seating available for each person who will be dining alone.

5. Set Up Tables, Chairs, and Equipment: Ensure all tables, chairs, and food stations are clean and set up so guests do not accidentally break things during the party. You 
should also make sure there is a place for drinks such as glasses and a few bottles of water or other beverages if they are allowed.

6. Prepare Food and Wine: This includes setting up serving dishes, utensils, napkins, etc. You might want to have food that guests can eat on their own at different stations 
throughout the party if you are doing some cooking in advance. The same goes for wine - it should be served out of a pitcher or decanter as opposed to glasses to avoid spilling.

7. Set Up the Sound System: If your venue allows, you might want to set up some music or a DJ to keep the party going. You can also have some background noise if possible to 
make the space more inviting and comfortable for guests.

8. Organize Storage Space: It's crucial that there is enough storage space available in any given area of the room at all times as you might be hosting a large number of guests.
If possible, use storage containers or bins to store food and drinks when they are not being served.

**Step 4: Plan for Party Activities and Entertainment**

1. Create Music: Create some music that your guests can enjoy without it seeming too loud. You don't need anything extremely complex but just a good mix of different genres to 
keep the party interesting.

2. Set Up Games or Activities: Depending on the number of guests, there are many fun activities you could set up throughout the day. This could be anything from a photo booth 
with silly pictures for each guest to create a funny picture collage, or games such as 'Guess Who' where guests have to guess who is sitting in their seat when called.

3. Play Music: During the party, ensure that you keep music playing at different levels so people can get used to the loud sound. Keep some soft background music going if 
possible for a while after the main part of the party to maintain a peaceful atmosphere.

4. Have 'The Talk': In advance, prepare your guests and encourage them to have an open conversation with each other about what they expect and are excited about this event. It 
might be as simple as asking about plans for their anniversary or wishing them all a happy birthday on the big day if possible.

**Step 5: Finalize Setup and Clean Up**

1. Set Up Tables, Chairs, and Equipment: Check that everything is in place before guests start arriving and get set to eat and drink. This includes decorations if you chose to 
put up ones such as balloons or banners.

2. Clean Up: Finally, after the party is over, ensure that all food waste is disposed of properly and any mess left on tables are cleaned up promptly.

With these steps, it should be easy for you to organize a surprise birthday party for your friends and family members within your budget of $500 without repeating previous 
errors!

            Sure, here is the step-by-step plan to organize a $500-budget surprise birthday party for 20 friends and family members without repeating past code errors:

**Step 1: Choose a Date and Time**
Decide on the date and time that works best for you. A weekend evening or late afternoon would be ideal since it is the start of a new year, which could help to build excitement
among your guests. Also consider what time will keep everyone quiet until the party starts as loud noises may disturb others. Choose 2-3 hours before your friends and family are
expected to leave for dinner or after their night out with friends.

**Step 2: Finalize Guest List and Reservations**
Once you have decided on a date, finalize who will be attending the party. Make sure they are all close to 18 years old so it is not too difficult to handle them during the 
party if there's no one older than them who might start behaving badly. You also need to contact local venues that can accommodate your guests in a private area of the house or 
event space and reserve an empty room for two nights at least. Check availability, check if rooms are booked by the venue and have enough time to secure the date without 
disappointing the guests.

**Step 3: Plan the Party Logistics**

1. Create Guest List: You should create a list of all your guests so you can communicate with them and ensure there is not any misunderstanding or confusion about who will be 
attending. This can be done by creating an email template and sending it out to all your friends and family members in advance, ideally 2-3 weeks before the party.

2. Set Up Decorations: Decide on decorations that you like such as balloons, banners, flowers, etc., and set up these for the party area where guests will be seated or standing 
at the entrance to the venue. You might want to consider a buffet service at the start of the party to allow guests to pick what they like.

3. Choose Vessel: A table with a bar and food stations is ideal for serving your friends and family as there is plenty of seating on each table, thus allowing everyone to dine 
comfortably without having to stand. You might want to consider a buffet service at the start of the party or have some background noise if possible to make the space more 
inviting and comfortable for guests.

4. Plan for Food: Determine how many meals are needed for your guests based on their number and dietary needs. Choose catering if you prefer cooking in advance, or you can do it
yourself by preparing food in advance. It's also important to note that everyone must take a turn at eating during the party so make sure there is plenty of seating available 
for each person who will be dining alone.

5. Set Up Tables, Chairs, and Equipment: Ensure all tables, chairs, and equipment are clean and set up so guests do not accidentally break things during the party. You should 
also have a place for drinks such as glasses and a few bottles of water or other beverages if they are allowed.

**Step 4: Plan for Party Activities and Entertainment**

1. Create Music: Create some music that your guests can enjoy without it seeming too loud. You don't need anything extremely complex but just a good mix of different genres to 
keep the party interesting.

2. Set Up Games or Activities: Depending on the number of guests, there are many fun activities you could set up throughout the day. This could be anything from a photo booth 
with silly pictures for each guest to create a funny picture collage, or games such as 'Guess Who' where guests have to guess who is sitting in their seat when called.

3. Play Music: During the party, ensure that music is played at different levels so people can get used to it. Keep some soft background music going if possible for a while 
after the main part of the party without disrupting the atmosphere.

**Step 5: Finalize Setup and Clean Up**

1. Set up tables, chairs, and equipment as per your instructions in step 2.

2. Clean up after the party to make sure there is nothing that could be dangerous for guests. You should also have a place for drinks such as glasses and a few bottles of water 
or other beverages if they are allowed.

With these steps, it should be easy for you to organize a surprise birthday party for your friends and family members within your budget without repeating past errors!

            Sure, here is the step-by-step plan to organize a $500-budget surprise birthday party for 20 friends and family members without repeating past code errors:

**Step 1: Choose a Date and Time**
Decide on the date and time that works best for you. A weekend evening or late afternoon would be ideal since it is the start of a new year, which could help to build excitement
among your guests. Also consider what time will keep everyone quiet until the party starts as loud noises may disturb others. Choose 2-3 hours before your friends and family are
expected to leave for dinner or after their night out with friends.

**Step 2: Finalize Guest List and Reservations**
Once you have decided on a date, finalize who will be attending the party. Make sure they are all close to 18 years old so it is not too difficult to handle them during the 
party if there's no one older than them who might start behaving badly. You also need to contact local venues that can accommodate your guests in a private area of the house or 
event space and reserve an empty room for two nights at least. Check availability, check if rooms are booked by the venue and have enough time to secure the date without 
disappointing the guests.

**Step 3: Plan the Party Logistics**

1. Create Guest List: You should create a list of all your guests so you can communicate with them and ensure there is not any misunderstanding or confusion about who will be 
attending. This can be done by creating an email template and sending it out to all your friends and family members in advance, ideally 2-3 weeks before the party.

2. Set Up Decorations: Decide on decorations that you like such as balloons, banners, flowers, etc., and set up these for the party area where guests will be seated or standing 
at the entrance to the venue. You might want to consider a buffet service at the start of the party to allow guests to pick what they like.

3. Choose Vessel: A table with a bar and food stations is ideal for serving your friends and family as there is plenty of seating on each table, thus allowing everyone to dine 
comfortably without having to stand. You might want to consider a buffet service at the start of the party or have some background noise if possible to make the space more 
inviting and comfortable for guests.

4. Plan for Food: Determine how many meals are needed for your guests based on their number and dietary needs. Choose catering if you prefer cooking in advance, or you can do it
yourself by preparing food in advance that is easy to serve as a potluck. It's also important to note that everyone must take a turn at eating during the party so make sure 
there is plenty of seating available for each person who will be dining alone.

5. Set Up Tables, Chairs, and Equipment: Ensure all tables, chairs, and equipment are clean and set up so guests do not accidentally break things during the party. You should 
also have a place for drinks such as glasses and a few bottles of water or other beverages if they are allowed.

**Step 4: Plan for Party Activities and Entertainment**

1. Create Music: Create some music that your guests can enjoy without it seeming too loud. You don't need anything extremely complex but just a good mix of different genres to 
keep the party interesting.

2. Set Up Games or Activities: Depending on the number of guests, there are many fun activities you could set up throughout the day. This could be anything from a photo booth 
with silly pictures for each guest to create a funny picture collage, or games such as 'Guess Who' where guests have to guess who is sitting in their seat when called.

3. Play Music: During the party, ensure that music is played at different levels so people can get used to it. Keep some soft background music going if possible for a while 
after the main part of the party without disrupting the atmosphere.

**Step 5: Finalize Setup and Clean Up**

1. Set up tables, chairs, and equipment as per your instructions in step 2.

2. Clean up after the party to make sure there is nothing that could be dangerous for guests. You should also have a place for drinks such as glasses and a few bottles of water 
or other beverages if they are allowed.

With these steps, it should be easy for you to organize a surprise birthday party for your friends and family members within your budget without repeating past errors!

**Step 1: Choose a Date and Time**
Decide on the date and time that works best for you. A weekend evening or late afternoon would be ideal since it is the start of a new year, which could help to build excitement
among your guests. Also consider what time will keep everyone quiet until the party starts as loud noises may disturb others. Choose 2-3 hours before your friends and family are
expected to leave for dinner or after their night out with friends.

**Step 2: Finalize Guest List and Reservations**
Once you have decided on a date, finalize who will be attending the party. Make sure they are all close to 18 years old so it is not too difficult to handle them during the 
party if there's no one older than them who might start behaving badly. You also need to contact local venues that can accommodate your guests in a private area of the house or 
event space and reserve an empty room for two nights at least. Check availability, check if rooms are booked by the venue and have enough time to secure the date without 
disappointing the guests.

**Step 3: Plan the Party Logistics**

1. Create Guest List: You should create a list of all your guests so you can communicate with them and ensure there is not any misunderstanding or confusion about who will be 
attending. This can be done by creating an email template and sending it out to all your friends and family members in advance, ideally 2-3 weeks before the party.

2. Set Up Decorations: Decide on decorations that you like such as balloons, banners, flowers, etc., and set up these for the party area where guests will be seated or standing 
at the entrance to the venue. You might want to consider a buffet service at the start of the party to allow guests to pick what they like.

3. Choose Vessel: A table with a bar and food stations is ideal for serving your friends and family as there is plenty of seating on each table, thus allowing everyone to dine 
comfortably without having to stand. You might want to consider a buffet service at the start of the party or have some soft background music if possible to make the space more 
inviting and comfortable for guests.

4. Plan for Food: Determine how many meals are needed for your guests based on their number and dietary needs. Choose catering if you prefer cooking in advance, or you can do it
yourself by preparing food in advance that is easy to serve as a potluck. It's also important to note that everyone must take a turn at eating during the party so make sure 
there is plenty of seating available for each person who will be dining alone.

5. Set Up Tables, Chairs, and Equipment: Ensure all tables, chairs, and equipment are clean and set up so guests do not accidentally break things during the party. You should 
also have a place for drinks such as glasses and a few bottles of water or other beverages if they are allowed.

**Step 4: Plan for Party Activities and Entertainment**

1. Create Music: Create some music that your guests can enjoy without it seeming too loud. You don't need anything extremely complex but just a good mix of different genres to 
keep the party interesting.

2. Set Up Games or Activities: Depending on the number of guests, there are many fun activities you could set up throughout the day. This could be anything from a photo booth 
with silly pictures for each guest to create a funny picture collage, or games such as 'Guess Who' where guests have to guess who is sitting in their seat when called.

3. Play Music: During the party, ensure that music is played at different levels so people can get used to it. Keep some soft background music going if possible for a while 
after the main part of the party without disrupting the atmosphere.

**Step 5: Finalize Setup and Clean Up**

1. Set up tables, chairs, and equipment as per your instructions in step 3.

2. Clean up after the party to make sure there is nothing that could be dangerous for guests. You should also have a place for drinks such as glasses and a few bottles of water 
or other beverages if they are allowed.

With these steps, it should be easy for you to organize a surprise birthday party for your friends and family members within your budget without repeating past errors!

            Sure, here is the step-by-step plan to organize a $500-budget surprise birthday party for 20 friends and family members without repeating past code errors:

**Step 1: Choose a Date and Time**
Decide on the date and time that works best for you. A weekend evening or late afternoon would be ideal since it is the start of a new year, which could help to build excitement
among your guests. Also consider what time will keep everyone quiet until the party starts as loud noises may disturb others. Choose 2-3 hours before your friends and family are
expected to leave for dinner or after their night out with friends.

**Step 2: Finalize Guest List and Reservations**
Once you have decided on a date, finalize who will be attending the party. Make sure they are all close to 18 years old so it is not too difficult to handle them during the 
party if there's no one older than them who might start behaving badly. You also need to contact local venues that can accommodate your guests in a private area of the house or 
event space and reserve an empty room for two nights at least. Check availability, check if rooms are booked by the venue and have enough time to secure the date without 
disappointing the guests.

**Step 3: Plan the Party Logistics**

1. Create Guest List: You should create a list of all your guests so you can communicate with them and ensure there is not any misunderstanding or confusion about who will be 
attending. This can be done by creating an email template and sending it out to all your friends and family members in advance, ideally 2-3 weeks before the party.

2. Set Up Decorations: Decide on decorations that you like such as balloons, banners, flowers, etc., and set up these for the party area where guests will be seated or standing 
at the entrance to the venue. You might want to consider a buffet service at the start of the party to allow guests to pick what they like.

3. Choose Vessel: A table with a bar and food stations is ideal for serving your friends and family as there is plenty of seating on each table, thus allowing everyone to dine 
comfortably without having to stand. You might want to consider a buffet service at the start of the party or have some soft background music if possible to make the space more 
inviting and comfortable for guests.

4. Plan for Food: Determine how many meals are needed for your guests based on their number and dietary needs. Choose catering if you prefer cooking in advance, or you can do it

there is plenty of seating available for each person who will be dining alone.

5. Set Up Tables, Chairs, and Equipment: Ensure all tables, chairs, and equipment are clean and set up so guests do not accidentally break things during the party. You should 
also have a place for drinks such as glasses and a few bottles of water or other beverages if they are allowed.

**Step 4: Plan for Party Activities and Entertainment**

1. Create Music: Create some music that your guests can enjoy without it seeming too loud. You don't need anything extremely complex but just a good mix of different genres to 
keep the party interesting.

2. Set Up Games or Activities: Depending on the number of guests, there are many fun activities you could set up throughout the day. This could be anything from a photo booth 
with silly pictures for each guest to create a funny picture collage, or games such as 'Guess Who' where guests have to guess who is sitting in their seat when called.

3. Play Music: During the party, ensure that music is played at different levels so people can get used to it. Keep some soft background music going if possible for a while 
after the main part of the party without disrupting the atmosphere.

**Step 5: Finalize Setup and Clean Up**

1. Set up tables, chairs, and equipment as per your instructions in step 3.

2. Clean up after the party to make sure there is nothing that could be dangerous for guests. You should also have a place for drinks such as glasses and a few bottles of water 
or other beverages if they are allowed.

With these steps, it should be easy for you to organize a surprise birthday party for your friends and family members within your budget without repeating past errors!

Sure, here is the step-by-step plan to organize a $500-budget surprise birthday party for 20 friends and family members without repeating past code errors:                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
**Step 1: Choose a Date and Time**                                                                                                                                               
Decide on the date and time that works best for you. A weekend evening or late afternoon would be ideal since it is the start of a new year, which could help to build excitement
among your guests. Also consider what time will keep everyone quiet until the party starts as loud noises may disturb others. Choose 2-3 hours before your friends and family are
expected to leave for dinner or after their night out with friends.                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
**Step 2: Finalize Guest List and Reservations**                                                                                                                                 
Once you have decided on a date, finalize who will be attending the party. Make sure they are all close to 18 years old so it is not too difficult to handle them during the     
party if there's no one older than them who might start behaving badly. You also need to contact local venues that can accommodate your guests in a private area of the house or 
event space and reserve an empty room for two nights at least. Check availability, check if rooms are booked by the venue and have enough time to secure the date without        
disappointing the guests.                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
**Step 3: Plan the Party Logistics**                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Create Guest List: You should create a list of all your guests so you can communicate with them and ensure there is not any misunderstanding or confusion about who will be   
attending. This can be done by creating an email template and sending it out to all your friends and family members in advance, ideally 2-3 weeks before the party.              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. Set Up Decorations: Decide on decorations that you like such as balloons, banners, flowers, etc., and set up these for the party area where guests will be seated or standing 
at the entrance to the venue. You might want to consider a buffet service at the start of the party to allow guests to pick what they like.                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3. Choose Vessel: A table with a bar and food stations is ideal for serving your friends and family as there is plenty of seating on each table, thus allowing everyone to dine  
comfortably without having to stand. You might want to consider a buffet service at the start of the party or have some soft background music if possible to make the space more 
inviting and comfortable for guests.                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
4. Plan for Food: Determine how many meals are needed for your guests based on their number and dietary needs. Choose catering if you prefer cooking in advance, or you can do it
yourself by preparing food in advance that is easy to serve as a potluck. It's also important to note that everyone must take a turn at eating during the party so make sure     
there is plenty of seating available for each person who will be dining alone.                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
5. Set Up Tables, Chairs, and Equipment: Ensure all tables, chairs, and equipment are clean and set up so guests do not accidentally break things during the party. You should   
also have a place for drinks such as glasses and a few bottles of water or other beverages if they are allowed.                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
**Step 4: Plan for Party Activities and Entertainment**                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Create Music: Create some music that your guests can enjoy without it seeming too loud. You don't need anything extremely complex but just a good mix of different genres to  
keep the party interesting.

**Step 1: Choose a Date and Time**                                                                                                                                               
Decide on the date and time that works best for you. A weekend evening or late afternoon would be ideal since it is the start of a new year, which could help to build excitement
among your guests. Also consider what time will keep everyone quiet until the party starts as loud noises may disturb others. Choose 2-3 hours before your friends and family are
expected to leave for dinner or after their night out with friends.                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
**Step 2: Finalize Guest List and Reservations**                                                                                                                                 
Once you have decided on a date, finalize who will be attending the party. Make sure they are all close to 18 years old so it is not too difficult to handle them during the     
party if there's no one older than them who might start behaving badly. You also need to contact local venues that can accommodate your guests in a private area of the house or 
event space and reserve an empty room for two nights at least. Check availability, check if rooms are booked by the venue and have enough time to secure the date without        
disappointing the guests.                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
**Step 3: Plan the Party Logistics**                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Create Guest List: You should create a list of all your guests so you can communicate with them and ensure there is not any misunderstanding or confusion about who will be   
attending. This can be done by creating an email template and sending it out to all your friends and family members in advance, ideally 2-3 weeks before the party.              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. Set Up Decorations: Decide on decorations that you like such as balloons, banners, flowers, etc., and set up these for the party area where guests will be seated or standing 
at the entrance to the venue. You might want to consider a buffet service at the start of the party to allow guests to pick what they like.                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3. Choose Vessel: A table with a bar and food stations is ideal for serving your friends and family as there is plenty of seating on each table, thus allowing everyone to dine  
comfortably without having to stand. You might want to consider a buffet service at the start of the party or have some soft background music if possible to make the space more 
inviting and comfortable for guests.                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
4. Plan for Food: Determine how many meals are needed for your guests based on their number and dietary needs. Choose catering if you prefer cooking in advance, or you can do it
yourself by preparing food in advance that is easy to serve as a potluck. It's also important to note that everyone must take a turn at eating during the party so make sure     
there is plenty of seating available for each person who will be dining alone.                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
5. Set Up Tables, Chairs, and Equipment: Ensure all tables, chairs, and equipment are clean and set up so guests do not accidentally break things during the party. You should   
also have a place for drinks such as glasses and a few bottles of water or other beverages if they are allowed.                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
**Step 4: Plan for Party Activities and Entertainment**                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Create Music: Create some music that your guests can enjoy without it seeming too loud. You don't need anything extremely complex but just a good mix of different genres to  
keep the party interesting.                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. Set Up Games or Activities: Depending on the number of guests, there are many fun activities you could set up throughout the day. This could be anything from a photo booth   
with silly pictures for each guest to create a funny picture collage, or games such as 'Guess Who' where guests have to guess who is sitting in their seat when called.          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3. Play Music: During the party, ensure that music is played at different levels so people can get used to it. Keep some soft background music going if possible for a while     
after the main part of the party without disrupting the atmosphere.                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
**Step 5: Finalize Setup and Clean Up**                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Set up tables, chairs, and equipment as per your instructions in step 3.                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. Clean up after the party to make sure there is nothing that could be dangerous for guests. You should also have a place for drinks such as glasses and a few bottles of water 
or other beverages if they are allowed.

disappointing the guests.                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
**Step 3: Plan the Party Logistics**                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Create Guest List: You should create a list of all your guests so you can communicate with them and ensure there is not any misunderstanding or confusion about who will be   
attending. This can be done by creating an email template and sending it out to all your friends and family members in advance, ideally 2-3 weeks before the party.              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. Set Up Decorations: Decide on decorations that you like such as balloons, banners, flowers, etc., and set up these for the party area where guests will be seated or standing 
at the entrance to the venue. You might want to consider a buffet service at the start of the party to allow guests to pick what they like.                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3. Choose Vessel: A table with a bar and food stations is ideal for serving your friends and family as there is plenty of seating on each table, thus allowing everyone to dine  
comfortably without having to stand. You might want to consider a buffet service at the start of the party or have some soft background music if possible to make the space more 
inviting and comfortable for guests.                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
4. Plan for Food: Determine how many meals are needed for your guests based on their number and dietary needs. Choose catering if you prefer cooking in advance, or you can do it
yourself by preparing food in advance that is easy to serve as a potluck. It's also important to note that everyone must take a turn at eating during the party so make sure     
there is plenty of seating available for each person who will be dining alone.                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
5. Set up Tables, Chairs and Equipment: Ensure all tables, chairs, and equipment are clean and set up so guests do not accidentally break things during the party. You should    
also have a place for drinks such as glasses and a few bottles of water or other beverages if they are allowed.                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
**Step 4: Plan for Party Activities and Entertainment**                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Create Music: Create some music that your guests can enjoy without it seeming too loud. You don't need anything extremely complex but just a good mix of different genres to  
keep the party interesting.                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. Set Up Games or Activities: Depending on the number of guests, there are many fun activities you could set up throughout the day. This could be anything from a photo booth   
with silly pictures for each guest to create a funny picture collage, or games such as 'Guess Who' where guests have to guess who is sitting in their seat when called.          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3. Play Music: During the party, ensure that music is played at different levels so people can get used to it. Keep some soft background music going if possible for a while     
after the main part of the party without disrupting the atmosphere.                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
**Step 5: Finalize Setup and Clean Up**                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Set up tables, chairs and equipment as per your instructions in step 3.                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. Clean up after the party to make sure there is nothing that could be dangerous for guests. You should also have a place for drinks such as glasses and a few bottles of water 
or other beverages if they are allowed.

            Sure, here is the step-by-step plan to organize a $500-budget surprise birthday party for 20 friends and family members without repeating past code errors:

**Step 1: Choose a Date and Time**
Decide on the date and time that works best for you. A weekend evening or late afternoon would be ideal since it is the start of a new year, which could help to build excitement
among your guests. Also consider what time will keep everyone quiet until the party starts as loud noises may disturb others. Choose 2-3 hours before your friends and family are
expected to leave for dinner or after their night out with friends.

**Step 2: Finalize Guest List and Reservations**
Once you have decided on a date, finalize who will be attending the party. Make sure they are all close to 18 years old so it is not too difficult to handle them during the 
party if there's no one older than them who might start behaving badly. You also need to contact local venues that can accommodate your guests in a private area of the house or 
event space and reserve an empty room for two nights at least. Check availability, check if rooms are booked by the venue and have enough time to secure the date without 
disappointing the guests.

**Step 3: Plan the Party Logistics**

attending. This can be done by creating an email template and sending it out to all your friends and family members in advance, ideally 2-3 weeks before the party.

You might want to consider a buffet service at the start of the party to allow guests to pick what they like.                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3. Choose Vessel: A table with a bar and food stations is ideal for serving your friends and family as there is plenty of seating on each table, thus allowing everyone to dine  
comfortably without having to stand. You might want to consider a buffet service at the start of the party or have some soft background music if possible to make the space more 
inviting and comfortable for guests.                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
4. Plan for Food: Determine how many meals are needed for your guests based on their number and dietary needs. Choose catering if you prefer cooking in advance, or you can do it
yourself by preparing food in advance that is easy to serve as a potluck. It's also important to note that everyone must take a turn at eating during the party so make sure     
there is plenty of seating available for each person who will be dining alone.                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
5. Set up Tables, Chairs and Equipment: Ensure all tables, chairs, and equipment are clean and set up so guests do not accidentally break things during the party. You should    
also have a place for drinks such as glasses and a few bottles of water or other beverages if they are allowed.                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
**Step 4: Plan for Party Activities and Entertainment**                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Create Music: Create some music that your guests can enjoy without it seeming too loud. You don't need anything extremely complex but just a good mix of different genres to  
keep the party interesting.                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. Set Up Games or Activities: Depending on the number of guests, there are many fun activities you could set up throughout the day. This could be anything from a photo booth   
with silly pictures for each guest to create a funny picture collage, or games such as 'Guess Who' where guests have to guess who is sitting in their seat when called.          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3. Play Music: During the party, ensure that music is played at different levels so people can get used to it. Keep some soft background music going if possible for a while     
after the main part of the party without disrupting the atmosphere.                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
**Step 5: Finalize Setup and Clean Up**                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Set up tables, chairs and equipment as per your instructions in step 3.                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. Clean up after the party to make sure there is nothing that could be dangerous for guests. You should also have a place for drinks such as glasses and a few bottles of water 
or other beverages if they are allowed.

            Sure, here is the step-by-step plan to organize a $500-budget surprise birthday party for 20 friends and family members without repeating past code errors:

**Step 1: Choose a Date and Time**
Decide on the date and time that works best for you. A weekend evening or late afternoon would be ideal since it is the start of a new year, which could help to build excitement
among your guests. Also consider what time will keep everyone quiet until the party starts as loud noises may disturb others. Choose 2-3 hours before your friends and family are
expected to leave for dinner or after their night out with friends.

**Step 2: Finalize Guest List and Reservations**
Once you have decided on a date, finalize who will be attending the party. Make sure they are all close to 18 years old so it is not too difficult to handle them during the 
party if there's no one older than them who might start behaving badly. You also need to contact local venues that can accommodate your guests in a private area of the house or 
event space and reserve an empty room for two nights at least. Check availability, check if rooms are booked by the venue and have enough time to secure the date without 
disappointing the guests.

**Step 3: Plan the Party Logistics**

1. Create Guest List: You should create a list of all your guests so you can communicate with them and ensure there is not any misunderstanding or confusion about who will be 
attending. This can be done by creating an email template and sending it out to all your friends and family members in advance, ideally 2-3 weeks before the party.

2. Set Up Decorations: Decide on decorations that you like such as balloons, banners, flowers, etc., and set up these for the party area where guests will be seated or standing 
at the entrance to the venue. You might want to consider a buffet service at the start of the party to allow guests to pick what they like.

also have a place for drinks such as glasses and a few bottles of water or other beverages if they are allowed.                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
**Step 4: Plan for Party Activities and Entertainment**                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Create Music: Create some music that your guests can enjoy without it seeming too loud. You don't need anything extremely complex but just a good mix of different genres to  
keep the party interesting.                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. Set Up Games or Activities: Depending on the number of guests, there are many fun activities you could set up throughout the day. This could be anything from a photo booth   
with silly pictures for each guest to create a funny picture collage, or games such as 'Guess Who' where guests have to guess who is sitting in their seat when called.          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3. Play Music: During the party, ensure that music is played at different levels so people can get used to it. Keep some soft background music going if possible for a while     
after the main part of the party without disrupting the atmosphere.                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
**Step 5: Finalize Setup and Clean Up**                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Set up tables, chairs and equipment as per your instructions in step 3.                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. Clean up after the party to make sure there is nothing that could be dangerous for guests. You should also have a place for drinks such as glasses and a few bottles of water 
or other beverages if they are allowed.

            Sure, here is the step-by-step plan to organize a $500-budget surprise birthday party for 20 friends and family members without repeating past code errors:

**Step 1: Choose a Date and Time**
Decide on the date and time that works best for you. A weekend evening or late afternoon would be ideal since it is the start of a new year, which could help to build excitement
among your guests. Also consider what time will keep everyone quiet until the party starts as loud noises may disturb others. Choose 2-3 hours before your friends and family are
expected to leave for dinner or after their night out with friends.

**Step 2: Finalize Guest List and Reservations**
Once you have decided on a date, finalize who will be attending the party. Make sure they are all close to 18 years old so it is not too difficult to handle them during the 
party if there's no one older than them who might start behaving badly. You also need to contact local venues that can accommodate your guests in a private area of the house or 
event space and reserve an empty room for two nights at least. Check availability, check if rooms are booked by the venue and have enough time to secure the date without 
disappointing the guests.

**Step 3: Plan the Party Logistics**

1. Create Guest List: You should create a list of all your guests so you can communicate with them and ensure there is not any misunderstanding or confusion about who will be 
attending. This can be done by creating an email template and sending it out to all your friends and family members in advance, ideally 2-3 weeks before the party.

2. Set Up Decorations: Decide on decorations that you like such as balloons, banners, flowers, etc., and set up these for the party area where guests will be seated or standing 
at the entrance to the venue. You might want to consider a buffet service at the start of the party to allow guests to pick what they like.

3. Choose Vessel: A table with a bar and food stations is ideal for serving your friends and family as there is plenty of seating on each table, thus allowing everyone to dine 
comfortably without having to stand. You might want to consider a buffet service at the start of the party or have some soft background music if possible to make the space more 
inviting and comfortable for guests.

4. Plan for Food: Determine how many meals are needed for your guests based on their number and dietary needs. Choose catering if you prefer cooking in advance, or you can do it
yourself by preparing food in advance that is easy to serve as a potluck. It's also important to note that everyone must take a turn at eating during the party so make sure 
there is plenty of seating available for each person who will be dining alone.

5. Set up Tables, Chairs and Equipment: Ensure all tables, chairs, and equipment are clean and set up so guests do not accidentally break things during the party. You should 
also have a place for drinks such as glasses and a few bottles of water or other beverages if they are allowed.

**Step 4: Plan for Party Activities and Entertainment**

keep the party interesting.                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. Set up Games or Activities: Depending on the number of guests, there are many fun activities you could set up throughout the day. This could be anything from a photo booth   
with silly pictures for each guest to create a funny picture collage, or games such as 'Guess Who' where guests have to guess who is sitting in their seat when called.          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3. Play Music: During the party, ensure that music is played at different levels so people can get used to it. Keep some soft background music going if possible for a while     
after the main part of the party without disrupting the atmosphere.                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
**Step 5: Finalize Setup and Clean Up**                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Set up tables, chairs and equipment as per your instructions in step 3.                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. Clean up after the party to make sure there is nothing that could be dangerous for guests. You should also have a place for drinks such as glasses and a few bottles of water 
or other beverages if they are allowed.

            Sure, here is the step-by-step plan to organize a $500-budget surprise birthday party for 20 friends and family members without repeating past code errors:

**Step 1: Choose a Date and Time**
Decide on the date and time that works best for you. A weekend evening or late afternoon would be ideal since it is the start of a new year, which could help to build excitement
among your guests. Also consider what time will keep everyone quiet until the party starts as loud noises may disturb others. Choose 2-3 hours before your friends and family are
expected to leave for dinner or after their night out with friends.

**Step 2: Finalize Guest List and Reservations**
Once you have decided on a date, finalize who will be attending the party. Make sure they are all close to 18 years old so it is not too difficult to handle them during the 
party if there's no one older than them who might start behaving badly. You also need to contact local venues that can accommodate your guests in a private area of the house or 
event space and reserve an empty room for two nights at least. Check availability, check if rooms are booked by the venue and have enough time to secure the date without 
disappointing the guests.

**Step 3: Plan the Party Logistics**

1. Create Guest List: You should create a list of all your guests so you can communicate with them and ensure there is not any misunderstanding or confusion about who will be 
attending. This can be done by creating an email template and sending it out to all your friends and family members in advance, ideally 2-3 weeks before the party.

2. Set Up Decorations: Decide on decorations that you like such as balloons, banners, flowers, etc., and set up these for the party area where guests will be seated or standing 
at the entrance to the venue. You might want to consider a buffet service at the start of the party to allow guests to pick what they like.

3. Choose Vessel: A table with a bar and food stations is ideal for serving your friends and family as there is plenty of seating on each table, thus allowing everyone to dine 
comfortably without having to stand. You might want to consider a buffet service at the start of the party or have some soft background music if possible to make the space more 
inviting and comfortable for guests.

4. Plan for Food: Determine how many meals are needed for your guests based on their number and dietary needs. Choose catering if you prefer cooking in advance, or you can do it
yourself by preparing food in advance that is easy to serve as a potluck. It's also important to note that everyone must take a turn at eating during the party so make sure 
there is plenty of seating available for each person who will be dining alone.

5. Set up Tables, Chairs and Equipment: Ensure all tables, chairs, and equipment are clean and set up so guests do not accidentally break things during the party. You should 
also have a place for drinks such as glasses and a few bottles of water or other beverages if they are allowed.

**Step 4: Plan for Party Activities and Entertainment**

1. Create Music: Create some music that your guests can enjoy without it seeming too loud. You don't need anything extremely complex but just a good mix of different genres to 
keep the party interesting.

after the main part of the party without disrupting the atmosphere.                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
**Step 5: Finalize Setup and Clean Up**                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Set up tables, chairs and equipment as per your instructions in step 3.                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. Clean up after the party to make sure there is nothing that could be dangerous for guests. You should also have a place for drinks such as glasses and a few bottles of water 
or other beverages if they are allowed.

            Sure, here is the step-by-step plan to organize a $500-budget surprise birthday party for 20 friends and family members without repeating past code errors:

**Step 1: Choose a Date and Time**
Decide on the date and time that works best for you. A weekend evening or late afternoon would be ideal since it is the start of a new year, which could help to build excitement
among your guests. Also consider what time will keep everyone quiet until the party starts as loud noises may disturb others. Choose 2-3 hours before your friends and family are
expected to leave for dinner or after their night out with friends.

**Step 2: Finalize Guest List and Reservations**
Once you have decided on a date, finalize who will be attending the party. Make sure they are all close to 18 years old so it is not too difficult to handle them during the 
party if there's no one older than them who might start behaving badly. You also need to contact local venues that can accommodate your guests in a private area of the house or 
event space and reserve an empty room for two nights at least. Check availability, check if rooms are booked by the venue and have enough time to secure the date without 
disappointing the guests.

**Step 3: Plan the Party Logistics**

1. Create Guest List: You should create a list of all your guests so you can communicate with them and ensure there is not any misunderstanding or confusion about who will be 
attending. This can be done by creating an email template and sending it out to all your friends and family members in advance, ideally 2-3 weeks before the party.

2. Set Up Decorations: Decide on decorations that you like such as balloons, banners, flowers, etc., and set up these for the party area where guests will be seated or standing 
at the entrance to the venue. You might want to consider a buffet service at the start of the party to allow guests to pick what they like.

3. Choose Vessel: A table with a bar and food stations is ideal for serving your friends and family as there is plenty of seating on each table, thus allowing everyone to dine 
comfortably without having to stand. You might want to consider a buffet service at the start of the party or have some soft background music if possible to make the space more 
inviting and comfortable for guests.

4. Plan for Food: Determine how many meals are needed for your guests based on their number and dietary needs. Choose catering if you prefer cooking in advance, or you can do it
yourself by preparing food in advance that is easy to serve as a potluck. It's also important to note that everyone must take a turn at eating during the party so make sure 
there is plenty of seating available for each person who will be dining alone.

5. Set up Tables, Chairs and Equipment: Ensure all tables, chairs, and equipment are clean and set up so guests do not accidentally break things during the party. You should 
also have a place for drinks such as glasses and a few bottles of water or other beverages if they are allowed.

**Step 4: Plan for Party Activities and Entertainment**

1. Create Music: Create some music that your guests can enjoy without it seeming too loud. You don't need anything extremely complex but just a good mix of different genres to 
keep the party interesting.

2. Set up Games or Activities: Depending on the number of guests, there are many fun activities you could set up throughout the day. This could be anything from a photo booth 
with silly pictures for each guest to create a funny picture collage, or games such as 'Guess Who' where guests have to guess who is sitting in their seat when called.

3. Play Music: During the party, ensure that music is played at different levels so people can get used to it. Keep some soft background music going if possible for a while

            Sure, here is the step-by-step plan to organize a $500-budget surprise birthday party for 20 friends and family members without repeating past code errors:

**Step 1: Choose a Date and Time**
Decide on the date and time that works best for you. A weekend evening or late afternoon would be ideal since it is the start of a new year, which could help to build excitement
among your guests. Also consider what time will keep everyone quiet until the party starts as loud noises may disturb others. Choose 2-3 hours before your friends and family are
expected to leave for dinner or after their night out with friends.

**Step 2: Finalize Guest List and Reservations**
Once you have decided on a date, finalize who will be attending the party. Make sure they are all close to 18 years old so it is not too difficult to handle them during the 
party if there's no one older than them who might start behaving badly. You also need to contact local venues that can accommodate your guests in a private area of the house or 
event space and reserve an empty room for two nights at least. Check availability, check if rooms are booked by the venue and have enough time to secure the date without 
disappointing the guests.

**Step 3: Plan the Party Logistics**

1. Create Guest List: You should create a list of all your guests so you can communicate with them and ensure there is not any misunderstanding or confusion about who will be 
attending. This can be done by creating an email template and sending it out to all your friends and family members in advance, ideally 2-3 weeks before the party.

2. Set Up Decorations: Decide on decorations that you like such as balloons, banners, flowers, etc., and set up these for the party area where guests will be seated or standing 
at the entrance to the venue. You might want to consider a buffet service at the start of the party to allow guests to pick what they like.

3. Choose Vessel: A table with a bar and food stations is ideal for serving your friends and family as there is plenty of seating on each table, thus allowing everyone to dine 
comfortably without having to stand. You might want to consider a buffet service at the start of the party or have some soft background music if possible to make the space more 
inviting and comfortable for guests.

4. Plan for Food: Determine how many meals are needed for your guests based on their number and dietary needs. Choose catering if you prefer cooking in advance, or you can do it
yourself by preparing food in advance that is easy to serve as a potluck. It's also important to note that everyone must take a turn at eating during the party so make sure 
there is plenty of seating available for each person who will be dining alone.

5. Set up Tables, Chairs and Equipment: Ensure all tables, chairs, and equipment are clean and set up so guests do not accidentally break things during the party. You should 
also have a place for drinks such as glasses and a few bottles of water or other beverages if they are allowed.

**Step 4: Plan for Party Activities and Entertainment**

1. Create Music: Create some music that your guests can enjoy without it seeming too loud. You don't need anything extremely complex but just a good mix of different genres to 
keep the party interesting.

2. Set up Games or Activities: Depending on the number of guests, there are many fun activities you could set up throughout the day. This could be anything from a photo booth 
with silly pictures for each guest to create a funny picture collage, or games such as 'Guess Who' where guests have to guess who is sitting in their seat when called.

3. Play Music: During the party, ensure that music is played at different levels so people can get used to it. Keep some soft background music going if possible for a while 
after the main part of the party without disrupting the atmosphere.

**Step 5: Finalize Setup and Clean Up**

1. Set up tables, chairs and equipment as per your instructions in step 3.

2. Clean up after the party to make sure there is nothing that could be dangerous for guests. You should also have a place for drinks such as glasses and a few bottles of water 
or other beverages if they are allowed.

Decide on the date and time that works best for you. A weekend evening or late afternoon would be ideal since it is the start of a new year, which could help to build excitement
among your guests. Also consider what time will keep everyone quiet until the party starts as loud noises may disturb others. Choose 2-3 hours before your friends and family are
expected to leave for dinner or after their night out with friends.

**Step 2: Finalize Guest List and Reservations**
Once you have decided on a date, finalize who will be attending the party. Make sure they are all close to 18 years old so it is not too difficult to handle them during the 
party if there's no one older than them who might start behaving badly. You also need to contact local venues that can accommodate your guests in a private area of the house or 
event space and reserve an empty room for two nights at least. Check availability, check if rooms are booked by the venue and have enough time to secure the date without 
disappointing the guests.

**Step 3: Plan the Party Logistics**

1. Create Guest List: You should create a list of all your guests so you can communicate with them and ensure there is not any misunderstanding or confusion about who will be 
attending. This can be done by creating an email template and sending it out to all your friends and family members in advance, ideally 2-3 weeks before the party.

2. Set Up Decorations: Decide on decorations that you like such as balloons, banners, flowers, etc., and set up these for the party area where guests will be seated or standing 
at the entrance to the venue. You might want to consider a buffet service at the start of the party to allow guests to pick what they like.

3. Choose Vessel: A table with a bar and food stations is ideal for serving your friends and family as there is plenty of seating on each table, thus allowing everyone to dine 
comfortably without having to stand. You might want to consider a buffet service at the start of the party or have some soft background music if possible to make the space more 
inviting and comfortable for guests.

4. Plan for Food: Determine how many meals are needed for your guests based on their number and dietary needs. Choose catering if you prefer cooking in advance, or you can do it
yourself by preparing food in advance that is easy to serve as a potluck. It's also important to note that everyone must take a turn at eating during the party so make sure 
there is plenty of seating available for each person who will be dining alone.

5. Set up Tables, Chairs and Equipment: Ensure all tables, chairs, and equipment are clean and set up so guests do not accidentally break things during the party. You should 
also have a place for drinks such as glasses and a few bottles of water or other beverages if they are allowed.

**Step 4: Plan for Party Activities and Entertainment**

1. Create Music: Create some music that your guests can enjoy without it seeming too loud. You don't need anything extremely complex but just a good mix of different genres to 
keep the party interesting.

2. Set up Games or Activities: Depending on the number of guests, there are many fun activities you could set up throughout the day. This could be anything from a photo booth 
with silly pictures for each guest to create a funny picture collage, or games such as 'Guess Who' where guests have to guess who is sitting in their seat when called.

3. Play Music: During the party, ensure that music is played at different levels so people can get used to it. Keep some soft background music going if possible for a while 
after the main part of the party without disrupting the atmosphere.

**Step 5: Finalize Setup and Clean Up**

1. Set up tables, chairs and equipment as per your instructions in step 3.

2. Clean up after the party to make sure there is nothing that could be dangerous for guests. You should also have a place for drinks such as glasses and a few bottles of water 
or other beverages if they are allowed.

With these steps, it should be easy for you to organize a surprise birthday party for your friends and family members within your budget without repeating previous errors!

            Sure, here is the step-by-step plan to organize a $500-budget surprise birthday party for 20 friends and family members without repeating past code errors:

**Step 1: Choose a Date and Time**
Decide on the date and time that works best for you. A weekend evening or late afternoon would be ideal since it is the start of a new year, which could help to build excitement
among your guests. Also consider what time will keep everyone quiet until the party starts as loud noises may disturb others. Choose 2-3 hours before your friends and family are
expected to leave for dinner or after their night out with friends.

**Step 2: Finalize Guest List and Reservations**
Once you have decided on a date, finalize who will be attending the party. Make sure they are all close to 18 years old so it is not too difficult to handle them during the 
party if there's no one older than them who might start behaving badly. You also need to contact local venues that can accommodate your guests in a private area of the house or 
event space and reserve an empty room for two nights at least. Check availability, check if rooms are booked by the venue and have enough time to secure the date without 
disappointing the guests.

**Step 3: Plan the Party Logistics**

1. Create Guest List: You should create a list of all your guests so you can communicate with them and ensure there is not any misunderstanding or confusion about who will be 
attending. This can be done by creating an email template and sending it out to all your friends and family members in advance, ideally 2-3 weeks before the party.

2. Set Up Decorations: Decide on decorations that you like such as balloons, banners, flowers, etc., and set up these for the party area where guests will be seated or standing 
at the entrance to the venue. You might want to consider a buffet service at the start of the party to allow guests to pick what they like.

3. Choose Vessel: A table with a bar and food stations is ideal for serving your friends and family as there is plenty of seating on each table, thus allowing everyone to dine 
comfortably without having to stand. You might want to consider a buffet service at the start of the party or have some soft background music if possible to make the space more 
inviting and comfortable for guests.

4. Plan for Food: Determine how many meals are needed for your guests based on their number and dietary needs. Choose catering if you prefer cooking in advance, or you can do it
yourself by preparing food in advance that is easy to serve as a potluck. It's also important to note that everyone must take a turn at eating during the party so make sure 
there is plenty of seating available for each person who will be dining alone.

5. Set up Tables, Chairs and Equipment: Ensure all tables, chairs, and equipment are clean and set up so guests do not accidentally break things during the party. You should 
also have a place for drinks such as glasses and a few bottles of water or other beverages if they are allowed.

**Step 4: Plan for Party Activities and Entertainment**

1. Create Music: Create some music that your guests can enjoy without it seeming too loud. You don't need anything extremely complex but just a good mix of different genres to 
keep the party interesting.

2. Set up Games or Activities: Depending on the number of guests, there are many fun activities you could set up throughout the day. This could be anything from a photo booth 
with silly pictures for each guest to create a funny picture collage, or games such as 'Guess Who' where guests have to guess who is sitting in their seat when called.

3. Play Music: During the party, ensure that music is played at different levels so people can get used to it. Keep some soft background music going if possible for a while 
after the main part of the party without disrupting the atmosphere.

**Step 5: Finalize Setup and Clean Up**

1. Set up tables, chairs and equipment as per your instructions in step 3.

2. Clean up after the party to make sure there is nothing that could be dangerous for guests. You should also have a place for drinks such as glasses and a few bottles of water 
or other beverages if they are allowed.

Sure, here is the step-by-step plan to organize a $500-budget surprise birthday party for 20 friends and family members without repeating past code errors:                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
**Step 1: Choose a Date and Time**                                                                                                                                               
Decide on the date and time that works best for you. A weekend evening or late afternoon would be ideal since it is the start of a new year, which could help to build excitement
among your guests. Also consider what time will keep everyone quiet until the party starts as loud noises may disturb others. Choose 2-3 hours before your friends and family are
expected to leave for dinner or after their night out with friends.                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
**Step 2: Finalize Guest List and Reservations**                                                                                                                                 
Once you have decided on a date, finalize who will be attending the party. Make sure they are all close to 18 years old so it is not too difficult to handle them during the     
party if there's no one older than them who might start behaving badly. You also need to contact local venues that can accommodate your guests in a private area of the house or 
event space and reserve an empty room for two nights at least. Check availability, check if rooms are booked by the venue and have enough time to secure the date without        
disappointing the guests.                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
**Step 3: Plan the Party Logistics**                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Create Guest List: You should create a list of all your guests so you can communicate with them and ensure there is not any misunderstanding or confusion about who will be   
attending. This can be done by creating an email template and sending it out to all your friends and family members in advance, ideally 2-3 weeks before the party.              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. Set up Decorations: Decide on decorations that you like such as balloons, banners, flowers, etc., and set up these for the party area where guests will be seated or standing 
at the entrance to the venue. You might want to consider a buffet service at the start of the party to allow guests to pick what they like.                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3. Choose Vessel: A table with a bar and food stations is ideal for serving your friends and family as there is plenty of seating on each table, thus allowing everyone to dine  
comfortably without having to stand. You might want to consider a buffet service at the start of the party or have some soft background music if possible to make the space more 
inviting and comfortable for guests.                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
4. Plan for Food: Determine how many meals are needed for your guests based on their number and dietary needs. Choose catering if you prefer cooking in advance, or you can do it
yourself by preparing food in advance that is easy to serve as a potluck. It's also important to note that everyone must take a turn at eating during the party so make sure     
there is plenty of seating available for each person who will be dining alone.                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
5. Set up Tables, Chairs and Equipment: Ensure all tables, chairs, and equipment are clean and set up so guests do not accidentally break things during the party. You should    
also have a place for drinks such as glasses and a few bottles of water or other beverages if they are allowed.                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
**Step 4: Plan for Party Activities and Entertainment**                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Create Music: Create some music that your guests can enjoy without it seeming too loud. You don't need anything extremely complex but just a good mix of different genres to  
keep the party interesting.                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. Set up Games or Activities: Depending on the number of guests, there are many fun activities you could set up throughout the day. This could be anything from a photo booth   
with silly pictures for each guest to create a funny picture collage, or games such as 'Guess Who' where guests have to guess who is sitting in their seat when called.          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3. Play Music: During the party, ensure that music is played at different levels so people can get used to it. Keep some soft background music going if possible for a while     
after the main part of the party without disrupting the atmosphere.                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
**Step 5: Finalize Setup and Clean Up**                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Set up tables, chairs and equipment as per your instructions in step 3.                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. Clean up after the party to make sure there is nothing that could be dangerous for guests. You should also have a place for drinks such as glasses and a few bottles of water 
or other beverages if they are allowed.

disappointing the guests.                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
**Step 3: Plan the Party Logistics**                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Create Guest List: You should create a list of all your guests so you can communicate with them and ensure there is not any misunderstanding or confusion about who will be   
attending. This can be done by creating an email template and sending it out to all your friends and family members in advance, ideally 2-3 weeks before the party.              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. Set up Decorations: Decide on decorations that you like such as balloons, banners, flowers, etc., and set up these for the party area where guests will be seated or standing 
at the entrance to the venue. You might want to consider a buffet service at the start of the party to allow guests to pick what they like.                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3. Choose Vessel: A table with a bar and food stations is ideal for serving your friends and family as there is plenty of seating on each table, thus allowing everyone to dine  
comfortably without having to stand. You might want to consider a buffet service at the start of the party or have some soft background music if possible to make the space more 
inviting and comfortable for guests.                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
4. Plan for Food: Determine how many meals are needed for your guests based on their number and dietary needs. Choose catering if you prefer cooking in advance, or you can do it
yourself by preparing food in advance that is easy to serve as a potluck. It's also important to note that everyone must take a turn at eating during the party so make sure     
there is plenty of seating available for each person who will be dining alone.                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
5. Set up Tables, Chairs and Equipment: Ensure all tables, chairs, and equipment are clean and set up so guests do not accidentally break things during the party. You should    
also have a place for drinks such as glasses and a few bottles of water or other beverages if they are allowed.                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
**Step 4: Plan for Party Activities and Entertainment**                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Create Music: Create some music that your guests can enjoy without it seeming too loud. You don't need anything extremely complex but just a good mix of different genres to  
keep the party interesting.                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. Set up Games or Activities: Depending on the number of guests, there are many fun activities you could set up throughout the day. This could be anything from a photo booth   
with silly pictures for each guest to create a funny picture collage, or games such as 'Guess Who' where guests have to guess who is sitting in their seat when called.          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3. Play Music: During the party, ensure that music is played at different levels so people can get used to it. Keep some soft background music going if possible for a while     
after the main part of the party without disrupting the atmosphere.                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
**Step 5: Finalize Setup and Clean Up**                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Set up tables, chairs and equipment as per your instructions in step 3.                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. Clean up after the party to make sure there is nothing that could be dangerous for guests. You should also have a place for drinks such as glasses and a few bottles of water 
or other beverages if they are allowed.

            Sure, here is the step-by-step plan to organize a $500-budget surprise birthday party for 20 friends and family members without repeating past code errors:

**Step 1: Choose a Date and Time**
Decide on the date and time that works best for you. A weekend evening or late afternoon would be ideal since it is the start of a new year, which could help to build excitement
among your guests. Also consider what time will keep everyone quiet until the party starts as loud noises may disturb others. Choose 2-3 hours before your friends and family are
expected to leave for dinner or after their night out with friends.

**Step 2: Finalize Guest List and Reservations**
Once you have decided on a date, finalize who will be attending the party. Make sure they are all close to 18 years old so it is not too difficult to handle them during the 
party if there's no one older than them who might start behaving badly. You also need to contact local venues that can accommodate your guests in a private area of the house or 
event space and reserve an empty room for two nights at least. Check availability, check if rooms are booked by the venue and have enough time to secure the date without 
disappointing the guests.

**Step 3: Plan the Party Logistics**

1. Create Guest List: You should create a list of all your guests so you can communicate with them and ensure there is not any misunderstanding or confusion about who will be 
attending. This can be done by creating an email template and sending it out to all your friends and family members in advance, ideally 2-3 weeks before the party.

You might want to consider a buffet service at the start of the party to allow guests to pick what they like.                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3. Choose Vessel: A table with a bar and food stations is ideal for serving your friends and family as there is plenty of seating on each table, thus allowing everyone to dine  
comfortably without having to stand. You might want to consider a buffet service at the start of the party or have some soft background music if possible to make the space more 
inviting and comfortable for guests.                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
4. Plan for Food: Determine how many meals are needed for your guests based on their number and dietary needs. Choose catering if you prefer cooking in advance, or you can do it
yourself by preparing food in advance that is easy to serve as a potluck. It's also important to note that everyone must take a turn at eating during the party so make sure     
there is plenty of seating available for each person who will be dining alone.                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
5. Set up Tables, Chairs and Equipment: Ensure all tables, chairs, and equipment are clean and set up so guests do not accidentally break things during the party. You should    
also have a place for drinks such as glasses and a few bottles of water or other beverages if they are allowed.                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
**Step 4: Plan for Party Activities and Entertainment**                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Create Music: Create some music that your guests can enjoy without it seeming too loud. You don't need anything extremely complex but just a good mix of different genres to  
keep the party interesting.                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. Set up Games or Activities: Depending on the number of guests, there are many fun activities you could set up throughout the day. This could be anything from a photo booth   
with silly pictures for each guest to create a funny picture collage, or games such as 'Guess Who' where guests have to guess who is sitting in their seat when called.          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3. Play Music: During the party, ensure that music is played at different levels so people can get used to it. Keep some soft background music going if possible for a while     
after the main part of the party without disrupting the atmosphere.                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
**Step 5: Finalize Setup and Clean Up**                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Set up tables, chairs and equipment as per your instructions in step 3.                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. Clean up after the party to make sure there is nothing that could be dangerous for guests. You should also have a place for drinks such as glasses and a few bottles of water 
or other beverages if they are allowed.

            Sure, here is the step-by-step plan to organize a $500-budget surprise birthday party for 20 friends and family members without repeating past code errors:

**Step 1: Choose a Date and Time**
Decide on the date and time that works best for you. A weekend evening or late afternoon would be ideal since it is the start of a new year, which could help to build excitement
among your guests. Also consider what time will keep everyone quiet until the party starts as loud noises may disturb others. Choose 2-3 hours before your friends and family are
expected to leave for dinner or after their night out with friends.

**Step 2: Finalize Guest List and Reservations**
Once you have decided on a date, finalize who will be attending the party. Make sure they are all close to 18 years old so it is not too difficult to handle them during the 
party if there's no one older than them who might start behaving badly. You also need to contact local venues that can accommodate your guests in a private area of the house or 
event space and reserve an empty room for two nights at least. Check availability, check if rooms are booked by the venue and have enough time to secure the date without 
disappointing the guests.

**Step 3: Plan the Party Logistics**

1. Create Guest List: You should create a list of all your guests so you can communicate with them and ensure there is not any misunderstanding or confusion about who will be 
attending. This can be done by creating an email template and sending it out to all your friends and family members in advance, ideally 2-3 weeks before the party.

2. Set up Decorations: Decide on decorations that you like such as balloons, banners, flowers, etc., and set up these for the party area where guests will be seated or standing 
at the entrance to the venue. You might want to consider a buffet service at the start of the party to allow guests to pick what they like.

also have a place for drinks such as glasses and a few bottles of water or other beverages if they are allowed.                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
**Step 4: Plan for Party Activities and Entertainment**                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Create Music: Create some music that your guests can enjoy without it seeming too loud. You don't need anything extremely complex but just a good mix of different genres to  
keep the party interesting.                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. Set up Games or Activities: Depending on the number of guests, there are many fun activities you could set up throughout the day. This could be anything from a photo booth   
with silly pictures for each guest to create a funny picture collage, or games such as 'Guess Who' where guests have to guess who is sitting in their seat when called.          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3. Play Music: During the party, ensure that music is played at different levels so people can get used to it. Keep some soft background music going if possible for a while     
after the main part of the party without disrupting the atmosphere.                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
**Step 5: Finalize Setup and Clean Up**                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Set up tables, chairs and equipment as per your instructions in step 3.                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. Clean up after the party to make sure there is nothing that could be dangerous for guests. You should also have a place for drinks such as glasses and a few bottles of water 
or other beverages if they are allowed.

            Sure, here is the step-by-step plan to organize a $500-budget surprise birthday party for 20 friends and family members without repeating past code errors:

**Step 1: Choose a Date and Time**
Decide on the date and time that works best for you. A weekend evening or late afternoon would be ideal since it is the start of a new year, which could help to build excitement
among your guests. Also consider what time will keep everyone quiet until the party starts as loud noises may disturb others. Choose 2-3 hours before your friends and family are
expected to leave for dinner or after their night out with friends.

**Step 2: Finalize Guest List and Reservations**
Once you have decided on a date, finalize who will be attending the party. Make sure they are all close to 18 years old so it is not too difficult to handle them during the 
party if there's no one older than them who might start behaving badly. You also need to contact local venues that can accommodate your guests in a private area of the house or 
event space and reserve an empty room for two nights at least. Check availability, check if rooms are booked by the venue and have enough time to secure the date without 
disappointing the guests.

**Step 3: Plan the Party Logistics**

1. Create Guest List: You should create a list of all your guests so you can communicate with them and ensure there is not any misunderstanding or confusion about who will be 
attending. This can be done by creating an email template and sending it out to all your friends and family members in advance, ideally 2-3 weeks before the party.

2. Set up Decorations: Decide on decorations that you like such as balloons, banners, flowers, etc., and set up these for the party area where guests will be seated or standing 
at the entrance to the venue. You might want to consider a buffet service at the start of the party to allow guests to pick what they like.

3. Choose Vessel: A table with a bar and food stations is ideal for serving your friends and family as there is plenty of seating on each table, thus allowing everyone to dine 
comfortably without having to stand. You might want to consider a buffet service at the start of the party or have some soft background music if possible to make the space more 
inviting and comfortable for guests.

4. Plan for Food: Determine how many meals are needed for your guests based on their number and dietary needs. Choose catering if you prefer cooking in advance, or you can do it
yourself by preparing food in advance that is easy to serve as a potluck. It's also important to note that everyone must take a turn at eating during the party so make sure 
there is plenty of seating available for each person who will be dining alone.

5. Set up Tables, Chairs and Equipment: Ensure all tables, chairs, and equipment are clean and set up so guests do not accidentally break things during the party. You should 
also have a place for drinks such as glasses and a few bottles of water or other beverages if they are allowed.

**Step 4: Plan for Party Activities and Entertainment**

1. Create Music: Create some music that your guests can enjoy without it seeming too loud. You don't need anything extremely complex but just a good mix of different genres to 
keep the party interesting.

2. Set up Games or Activities: Depending on the number of guests, there are many fun activities you could set up throughout the day. This could be anything from a photo booth

after the main part of the party without disrupting the atmosphere.

2. Clean up after the party to make sure there is nothing that could be dangerous for guests. You should also have a place for drinks such as glasses and a few bottles of water 
or other beverages if they are allowed.

5. Create a detailed budget breakdown based on recent event attendance figures, including venue rental costs, catering fees, decorations, music, and entertainment costs. Set aside some money for contingencies in case unforeseen expenses arise during the party planning process.

6. Plan a theme or dress code for the party to avoid confusion among guests. Decide whether to have formal attire for the kids and adults alike or opt for more casual options that fit your budget. Make sure it is something everyone will enjoy participating in.

7. Create a playlist of songs with an upbeat tempo suitable for a children's birthday celebration. The playlist can include classic party favorites, popular children's songs, and some fun tunes to keep guests entertained throughout the event.

8. Plan activities that will engage all ages during the party. Options could include games, bounce houses or other attractions that cater to various age groups. Ensure there is plenty of seating available for each person who will be attending without having them need to stand.

9. Confirm party details with your guests in advance so they can plan accordingly and ensure everyone arrives safely at the event. Send reminders before closing time as a courtesy, even if you already know all the attendees by name.

10. Finalize setup and cleanup procedures well in advance of the scheduled start time to ensure everything is set up comfortably and efficiently for guests upon arrival.

Task 81 complete.
