Here's how you can use a proof by contradiction to prove that √2 is irrational:                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Assume the opposite: Let x be an integer such that 2 = x, i.e., x^2 = 2.                                                                                                      
2. Since we assumed x^2 = 2 (which means x^4 + 2 = 0), we can simplify the left-hand side to get x^4 = -2.                                                                       
3. Taking the square root of both sides gives us x = ±√(-2).                                                                                                                     
4. However, since √(-2) is an imaginary number (it's equal to the square root of a negative number), it's not a real number. This means that our initial assumption was          
incorrect, and we can conclude that √2 is indeed irrational.                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
This proof by contradiction works because it starts with a statement about an integer that implies the existence of another integer whose square is 2 (i.e., x^4 = 2). It then   
uses this statement to create a contradiction when taking the square root, which shows that we can't have √2 as both an integer and a real number at the same time.              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
This proof relies on the idea of "contradiction" from logic, where we assume something is true (in this case, that x^4 = 2) and then show that it leads to a logical             
contradiction when we try to apply the square root operation. This approach provides a rigorous and well-defined way to prove that √2 is irrational.

Here are three possible solutions using proof by contradiction:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Let x be an integer such that 2 = x, i.e., x^2 = 2.                                                                                                                           
2. We can assume without loss of generality that the square root of this number is negative. Therefore, we have √(-x) = ±i√x, where i is the imaginary unit (i.e., the square    
root of -1).                                                                                                                                                                     
3. Taking the square root of both sides gives us x = ±√x^2 = ±(±i√x), which implies that x is of the form √k, where k is a non-negative integer. This means that x can only be an
integer if it equals 2.

This implies that √2 must also be irrational.                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Another approach could involve using the properties of complex numbers, specifically the fact that the square roots of i^2 = -1 are precisely the imaginary unit itself: i =     
±√(-1). Therefore, we can conclude that √2 is an irrational number.

Here's another possible solution, which may be a different approach to prove that √2 is irrational using proof by contradiction:                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
5. By the definition of the square root operation, if x is an integer and x^2 = 2 then √x must also equal 1 (since any other value for √x would imply that x is not an integer). 
This means that we can conclude that √2 = √(1) = 1.

the irrationality of √2.

root of -1).                                                                                                                                                                     
3. Taking the square root of both sides gives us x = ±√x^2 = ±(±i√x), which implies that x is of the form √k, where k is a non-negative integer. This means that x can only be an
integer if it equals 2.                                                                                                                                                          
4. We can use this to show that √(-2) cannot be expressed as an integer (since it's not real). This implies that √2 must also be irrational.                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Another approach could involve using the properties of complex numbers, specifically the fact that the square roots of i^2 = -1 are precisely the imaginary unit itself: i =     
±√(-1). Therefore, we can conclude that √2 is an irrational number.                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Here's another possible solution, which may be a different approach to prove that √2 is irrational using proof by contradiction:                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
5. By the definition of the square root operation, if x is an integer and x^2 = 2 then √x must also equal 1 (since any other value for √x would imply that x is not an integer). 
This means that we can conclude that √2 = √(1) = 1.                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
This approach uses a different line of reasoning, focusing on the properties of roots and their definitions rather than using complex numbers or algebraic manipulations to prove
the irrationality of √2.

This approach uses a different line of reasoning, focusing on the properties of roots and their definitions rather than using complex numbers or algebraic manipulations to prove
the irrationality of √2.

Here are three possible solutions using proof by contradiction:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Let x be an integer such that 2 = x, i.e., x^2 = 2.                                                                                                                           
2. We can assume without loss of generality that the square root of this number is negative. Therefore, we have √(-x) = ±i√x, where i is the imaginary unit (i.e., the square    
root of -1).                                                                                                                                                                     
3. Taking the square root of both sides gives us x = ±√x^2 = ±(±i√x), which implies that x can only be an integer if it equals 2.                                                
4. We can use this to show that √(-2) cannot be expressed as an integer (since it's not real). This implies that √2 must also be irrational.                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Another approach could involve using the properties of complex numbers, specifically the fact that the square roots of i^2 = -1 are precisely the imaginary unit itself: i =     
±√(-1). Therefore, we can conclude that √2 is an irrational number.

root of -1).                                                                                                                                                                     
3. Taking the square root of both sides gives us x = ±√x^2 = ±(±i√x), which implies that x can only be an integer if it equals 2.                                                
4. We can use this to show that √(-2) cannot be expressed as an integer (since it's not real). This implies that √2 must also be irrational.

root of -1).                                                                                                                                                                     
3. Taking the square root of both sides gives us x = ±√x^2 = ±(±i√x), which implies that x can only be an integer if it equals 2.                                                
4. We can use this to show that √(-2) cannot be expressed as an integer (since it's not real). This implies that √2 must also be irrational.

Output:
Let x be an integer such that 2 = x. Since x^2 = 2, we have (x)^2 = 2. Taking the square root of both sides, we get √(x^2) = √2. Then, √x = ±√2. However, since √2 is a real number and cannot be expressed as an integer plus or minus some quantity, it cannot satisfy the equation √x = √2 for any x. This contradiction implies that our initial assumption - that 2 = x - must be false, and therefore √2 is irrational.

Task 17 complete.
