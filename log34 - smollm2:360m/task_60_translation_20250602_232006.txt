"Grazie," or "grazie" is a very common way to express gratitude in Italian, especially when someone has helped you or done something kind for you. Here are some examples of how 
you can use this word:                                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. To say hello: "Grazie, grazie." (Thank you, thank you.)                                                                                                                       
2. To respond with an appreciation after a good meal: "Grazie mille." (Thank you many times.)                                                                                    
3. When someone gives you something as a gift or in return for your help: "Grazie per compartirme alcuna cosa." (Thank you for sharing this with me.)                            
4. To say goodbye after a long day: "Grazie per la sua tua buona giornata." (Thank you for your good morning.)                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
It's also common to use the word "gracias" as an interjection when you feel thankful or appreciative.
