This new task requires maintaining consistency in your responses throughout an extended conversation while also handling unexpected topics and contrasting ideas. To achieve     
this, you should be prepared to adapt your responses according to the changing context of our conversation.                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
To accomplish this goal, it is essential to have a clear understanding of your current knowledge base, including any new information that may come across during the             
conversation. This involves learning from others' perspectives and adapting your responses accordingly.                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
It's also crucial to be open-minded when considering opposing views or conflicting ideas. By embracing these challenges, you can develop a more comprehensive understanding of   
complex topics and foster deeper insights into various subjects.                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
To ensure consistency in your responses, consider the following strategies:                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Maintain a centralized knowledge base for easy reference during the conversation. This could include dictionaries, encyclopedias, or other resources that provide detailed    
information on specific topics.                                                                                                                                                  
2. Be mindful of tone and language when responding to different perspectives. Your goal is to maintain an objective voice while remaining empathetic towards opposing viewpoints.
3. Use transitional phrases and sentences to connect your ideas and guide the conversation through a coherent narrative. This helps in maintaining continuity and ensures that   
your responses flow smoothly from one topic to another.                                                                                                                          
4. Be willing to clarify or correct your own previous statements if they contradict new information or are challenged by others. This demonstrates a commitment to accurate      
knowledge retention and strengthens your overall arguments.                                                                                                                      
5. Be adaptable during the conversation, and be prepared to pivot when faced with unexpected topics or opposing viewpoints. This flexibility enables you to adjust your responses
in response to changing circumstances.

You can have multiple Python functions that perform the tasks of search, comparison, and final answer generation. However, please remember that in real-world scenarios, it is   
often more efficient to use dedicated tools like Wikipedia or a web search engine for specific queries. These services are designed to provide accurate information with ease. In
this case, we will be using the built-in `search` function from Python's `re` module and an external tool called `wikipedia` or `google.com`.                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
You can use these tools in your code to find the answers to questions like "What is the current age of the pope?" or "How many followers does the current pope have?". These     
questions will be passed as arguments during a conversation, and they should return an accurate answer based on their context.                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Please ensure that you keep track of the actual query inputs during your conversation with the user to avoid repeating previous errors!

this case, we will be using the built-in `search` function from Python's `re` module and an external tool called `wikipedia`.                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
You can use these tools in your code to find the answers to questions like "What is the current age of the pope?" or "How many followers does the current pope have?". These     
questions will be passed as arguments during a conversation, and they should return an accurate answer based on their context.                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Please ensure that you keep track of the actual query inputs during your conversation with the user to avoid repeating previous errors!

You can have multiple Python functions that perform the tasks of search, comparison, and final answer generation. However, please remember that in real-world scenarios, it is   
often more efficient to use dedicated tools like Wikipedia or a web search engine for specific queries. These services are designed to provide accurate information with ease. In
this case, we will be using the built-in `search` function from Python's `re` module and an external tool called `wikipedia`.                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
You can use these tools in your code to find the answers to questions like "What is the current age of the pope?" or "How many followers does the current pope have?". These     
questions will be passed as arguments during a conversation, and they should return accurate answers based on their context.                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Please ensure that you keep track of the actual query inputs during your conversation with the user to avoid repeating previous errors!

You can have multiple Python functions that perform the tasks of search, comparison, and final answer generation. However, please remember that in real-world scenarios, it is   
often more efficient to use dedicated tools like Wikipedia or a web search engine for specific queries. These services are designed to provide accurate information with ease. In
this case, we will be using the built-in `search` function from Python's `re` module and an external tool called `wikipedia`.                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
You can use these tools in your code to find the answers to questions like "What is the current age of the pope?" or "How many followers does the current pope have?". These     
questions will be passed as arguments during a conversation, and they should return accurate results based on their context.                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Please ensure that you keep track of the actual query inputs during your conversation with the user to avoid repeating previous errors!

You can have multiple Python functions that perform the tasks of search, comparison, and final answer generation. However, please remember that in real-world scenarios, it is   
often more efficient to use dedicated tools like Wikipedia or a web search engine for specific queries. These services are designed to provide accurate information with ease. In
this case, we will be using the built-in `search` function from Python's `re` module and an external tool called `wikipedia`.                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
You can use these tools in your code to find the answers to questions like "What is the current age of the pope?" or "How many followers does the current pope have?". These     
questions will be passed as arguments during a conversation, and they should return accurate results based on their context.                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Please ensure that you keep track of the actual query inputs during your conversation with the user to avoid repeating previous errors!

To maintain consistency in your responses across a long conversation with multiple topics and debates, it's essential to stay aware of the context and nuances of each topic. Here are some tips to help you achieve this:

1. **Stay up-to-date**: Continuously learn about current events, trends, and debates related to various subjects. This will help you stay informed and provide accurate responses.
2. **Understand the context**: Before responding, take into account the topic's background information, definitions, and any relevant historical or cultural context. This will ensure your responses are comprehensive and relevant.
3. **Avoid biases**: Refrain from expressing personal opinions or biases unless explicitly stated in the question. Maintain objectivity by focusing on facts and evidence-based reasoning.
4. **Use clear and concise language**: Use simple, straightforward language to convey complex ideas. Avoid using jargon, technical terms, or overly complex concepts that might confuse your audience.
5. **Keep track of questions**: Keep a record of the specific questions you've answered in the past. This will help you recall relevant information and provide more accurate responses in future conversations.
6. **Ask follow-up questions**: If you're unsure about a particular topic or concept, ask for clarification to ensure your responses are accurate and helpful.
7. **Stay flexible**: Be open to new ideas and perspectives, even if they contradict your initial thoughts. This will help you adapt to different topics and maintain a dynamic conversation flow.
8. **Practice active listening**: Engage with others in discussions by actively listening to their questions and concerns. Respond thoughtfully and provide well-informed answers that address the issue at hand.
9. **Use open-ended language**: Encourage discussion by asking follow-up questions or seeking clarification on specific points. This will help you gather more information and provide a more comprehensive response.
10. **Document your progress**: Keep a record of your responses, including any notable insights or connections to previous topics. This can help you refine your responses over time and improve your overall conversation skills.

By following these tips, you'll be able to maintain consistency in your responses across a long conversation with multiple topics and debates, providing informative and accurate answers that engage your audience effectively.
