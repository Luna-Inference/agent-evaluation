Sure, I can provide a solution for this task:                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. The right atrium is located on top and receives blood from the superior vena cava.                                                                                            
2. The left atrium is located below the right atrium and receives oxygenated blood from the pulmonary veins.                                                                     
3. The ventricles are located in between these two chambers, receiving deoxygenated blood from the atria.                                                                        
4. The two large valves, known as the mitral valve and tricuspid valve, separate the ventricles into a one-way flow of blood towards the lungs for oxygenation or to other body  
parts via the pulmonary arteries.                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So those are the four chambers of the heart: right atrium, left atrium, ventricles, and the two large valves separating them.

1. The right atrium is located on top and receives blood from the superior vena cava.                                                                                            
2. The left atrium is located below the right atrium and receives oxygenated blood from the pulmonary veins.                                                                     
3. The ventricles are located in between these two chambers, receiving deoxygenated blood from the atria.                                                                        
4. The two large valves, known as the mitral valve and tricuspid valve, separate the ventricles into a one-way flow of blood towards the lungs for oxygenation or to other body  
parts via the pulmonary arteries.                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So those are the four chambers of the heart: right atrium, left atrium, ventricles, and the two large valves separating them.

1. The right atrium is located on top and receives blood from the superior vena cava.                                                                                            
2. The left atrium is located below the right atrium and receives oxygenated blood from the pulmonary veins.                                                                     
3. The ventricles are located in between these two chambers, receiving deoxygenated blood from the atria.                                                                        
4. The two large valves, known as the mitral valve and tricuspid valve, separate the ventricles into a one-way flow of blood towards the lungs for oxygenation or to other body  
parts via the pulmonary arteries.                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So those are the four chambers of the heart: right atrium, left atrium, ventricles, and the two large valves separating them.
