The powerhouse of a cell is known as the mitochondria. It's an organelle found within eukaryotic cells and performs several crucial functions such as generating energy for the  
cell through cellular respiration, producing some organic molecules, and regulating calcium homeostasis. The inner mitochondrial membrane contains many sub-units called cristae,
which increase the surface area for generating ATP (adenosine triphosphate), a molecule that stores chemical energy in the form of phosphate bonds.                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The energy produced by mitochondria can then be utilized by various cellular processes such as biosynthesis, protein synthesis, and signaling to ensure proper cellular function 
and growth. Overall, the mitochondria play a vital role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and supporting eukaryotic cells in their primary functions.

which increase the surface area for generating ATP (adenosine triphosphate), a molecule that stores chemical energy in the form of phosphate bonds.                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The energy produced by mitochondria can then be utilized by various cellular processes such as biosynthesis, protein synthesis, and signaling to ensure proper cellular function 
and growth. Overall, the mitochondria play a vital role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and supporting eukaryotic cells in their primary functions.

The powerhouse of a cell is known as the mitochondria. It's an organelle found within eukaryotic cells and performs several crucial functions such as generating energy for the  
cell through cellular respiration, producing some organic molecules, and regulating calcium homeostasis. The inner mitochondrial membrane contains many sub-units called cristae,
which increase the surface area for generating ATP (adenosine triphosphate), a molecule that stores chemical energy in the form of phosphate bonds.                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The energy produced by mitochondria can then be utilized by various cellular processes such as biosynthesis, protein synthesis, and signaling to ensure proper cellular function 
and growth. Overall, the mitochondria play a vital role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and supporting eukaryotic cells in their primary functions.
