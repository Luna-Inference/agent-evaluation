To calculate the average speed of the train, we need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken.                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The train travels a total distance of 2 * 120 = 240 miles in 2 hours (at an average speed of 60 mph). So, the total distance is:                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now we need to find the time taken for each leg of the journey. The train travels a total distance of 80 miles in 1.5 hours at an average speed of 40 mph. So, the time taken is:
                                                                                                                                                                                 
80 miles / 40 mph = 2 hours                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The total time taken is:                                                                                                                                                         
2 hours * 2 = 4 hours                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now we can calculate the average speed for the entire journey by dividing the total distance traveled (120 miles) by the total time taken (4 hours). Therefore, the average speed
of the train is:                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
120 miles / 4 hours = 30 mph                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So, the train travels at an average speed of 30 mph for the entire journey.

            Here is your code snippet:
            To calculate the average speed of the train, we need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken. 

The train travels a total distance of 2 * 120 = 240 miles in 2 hours (at an average speed of 60 mph). So, the total distance is:

60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles

Now we need to find the time taken for each leg of the journey. The train travels a total distance of 80 miles in 1.5 hours at an average speed of 40 mph. So, the time taken is:

80 miles / 40 mph = 2 hours

The total time taken is:
2 hours * 2 = 4 hours

Now we can calculate the average speed for the entire journey by dividing the total distance traveled (120 miles) by the total time taken (4 hours). Therefore, the average speed
of the train is:

120 miles / 4 hours = 30 mph

So, the train travels at an average speed of 30 mph for the entire journey.

             To calculate the average speed of the train, we need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken.                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The train travels a total distance of 2 * 120 = 240 miles in 2 hours (at an average speed of 60 mph). So, the total distance is:

Now we need to find the time taken for each leg of the journey. The train travels a total distance of 80 miles in 1.5 hours at an average speed of 40 mph. So, the time taken is:
                                                                                                                                                                                 
80 miles / 40 mph = 2 hours                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The total time taken is:                                                                                                                                                         
2 hours * 2 = 4 hours                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now we can calculate the average speed for the entire journey by dividing the total distance traveled (120 miles) by the total time taken (4 hours). Therefore, the average speed
of the train is:                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
120 miles / 4 hours = 30 mph                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So, the train travels at an average speed of 30 mph for the entire journey.

             To calculate the average speed of the train, we need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken.                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The train travels a total distance of 2 * 120 = 240 miles in 2 hours (at an average speed of 60 mph). So, the total distance is:                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now we need to find the time taken for each leg of the journey. The train travels a total distance of 80 miles in 1.5 hours at an average speed of 40 mph. So, the time taken is:
                                                                                                                                                                                 
80 miles / 40 mph = 2 hours                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The total time taken is:                                                                                                                                                         
2 hours * 2 = 4 hours                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now we can calculate the average speed for the entire journey by dividing the total distance traveled (120 miles) by the total time taken (4 hours). Therefore, the average speed
of the train is:                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
120 miles / 4 hours = 30 mph                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So, the train travels at an average speed of 30 mph for the entire journey.

            Here is your code snippet:                                                                                                                                           
             To calculate the average speed of the train, we need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken.                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The train travels a total distance of 2 * 120 = 240 miles in 2 hours (at an average speed of 60 mph). So, the total distance is:                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now we need to find the time taken for each leg of the journey. The train travels a total distance of 80 miles in 1.5 hours at an average speed of 40 mph. So, the time taken is:
                                                                                                                                                                                 
80 miles / 40 mph = 2 hours                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The total time taken is:                                                                                                                                                         
2 hours * 2 = 4 hours                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now we can calculate the average speed for the entire journey by dividing the total distance traveled (120 miles) by the total time taken (4 hours). Therefore, the average speed
of the train is:                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
120 miles / 4 hours = 30 mph                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So, the train travels at an average speed of 30 mph for the entire journey.

Now we need to find the time taken for each leg of the journey. The train travels a total distance of 80 miles in 1.5 hours at an average speed of 40 mph. So, the time taken is:

80 miles / 40 mph = 2 hours

The total time taken is:
2 hours * 2 = 4 hours

Now we can calculate the average speed for the entire journey by dividing the total distance traveled (120 miles) by the total time taken (4 hours). Therefore, the average speed
of the train is:

120 miles / 4 hours = 30 mph

So, the train travels at an average speed of 30 mph for the entire journey.

             To calculate the average speed of the train, we need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken.                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The train travels a total distance of 2 * 120 = 240 miles in 2 hours (at an average speed of 60 mph). So, the total distance is:                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now we need to find the time taken for each leg of the journey. The train travels a total distance of 80 miles in 1.5 hours at an average speed of 40 mph. So, the time taken is:
                                                                                                                                                                                 
80 miles / 40 mph = 2 hours                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The total time taken is:                                                                                                                                                         
2 hours * 2 = 4 hours                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now we can calculate the average speed for the entire journey by dividing the total distance traveled (120 miles) by the total time taken (4 hours). Therefore, the average speed
of the train is:                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
120 miles / 4 hours = 30 mph                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So, the train travels at an average speed of 30 mph for the entire journey.

The train travels a total distance of 2 * 120 = 240 miles in 2 hours (at an average speed of 60 mph). So, the total distance is:

Now we need to find the time taken for each leg of the journey. The train travels a total distance of 80 miles in 1.5 hours at an average speed of 40 mph. So, the time taken is:

80 miles / 40 mph = 2 hours

The total time taken is:
2 hours * 2 = 4 hours

Now we can calculate the average speed for the entire journey by dividing the total distance traveled (120 miles) by the total time taken (4 hours). Therefore, the average speed
of the train is:

120 miles / 4 hours = 30 mph

So, the train travels at an average speed of 30 mph for the entire journey.

             To calculate the average speed of the train, we need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken.                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The train travels a total distance of 2 * 120 = 240 miles in 2 hours (at an average speed of 60 mph). So, the total distance is:                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now we need to find the time taken for each leg of the journey. The train travels a total distance of 80 miles in 1.5 hours at an average speed of 40 mph. So, the time taken is:
                                                                                                                                                                                 
80 miles / 40 mph = 2 hours                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The total time taken is:                                                                                                                                                         
2 hours * 2 = 4 hours                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now we can calculate the average speed for the entire journey by dividing the total distance traveled (120 miles) by the total time taken (4 hours). Therefore, the average speed
of the train is:                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
120 miles / 4 hours = 30 mph                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So, the train travels at an average speed of 30 mph for the entire journey.

The train travels a total distance of 2 * 120 = 240 miles in 2 hours (at an average speed of 60 mph). So, the total distance is:

Now we need to find the time taken for each leg of the journey. The train travels a total distance of 80 miles in 1.5 hours at an average speed of 40 mph. So, the time taken is:

80 miles / 40 mph = 2 hours

The total time taken is:
2 hours * 2 = 4 hours

Now we can calculate the average speed for the entire journey by dividing the total distance traveled (120 miles) by the total time taken (4 hours). Therefore, the average speed
of the train is:

120 miles / 4 hours = 30 mph

So, the train travels at an average speed of 30 mph for the entire journey.

             To calculate the average speed of the train, we need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken.                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The train travels a total distance of 2 * 120 = 240 miles in 2 hours (at an average speed of 60 mph). So, the total distance is:                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now we need to find the time taken for each leg of the journey. The train travels a total distance of 80 miles in 1.5 hours at an average speed of 40 mph. So, the time taken is:
                                                                                                                                                                                 
80 miles / 40 mph = 2 hours                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The total time taken is:                                                                                                                                                         
2 hours * 2 = 4 hours                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now we can calculate the average speed for the entire journey by dividing the total distance traveled (120 miles) by the total time taken (4 hours). Therefore, the average speed
of the train is:                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
120 miles / 4 hours = 30 mph                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So, the train travels at an average speed of 30 mph for the entire journey.

The train travels a total distance of 2 * 120 = 240 miles in 2 hours (at an average speed of 60 mph). So, the total distance is:

Now we need to find the time taken for each leg of the journey. The train travels a total distance of 80 miles in 1.5 hours at an average speed of 40 mph. So, the time taken is:

80 miles / 40 mph = 2 hours

The total time taken is:
2 hours * 2 = 4 hours

Now we can calculate the average speed for the entire journey by dividing the total distance traveled (120 miles) by the total time taken (4 hours). Therefore, the average speed
of the train is:

120 miles / 4 hours = 30 mph

So, the train travels at an average speed of 30 mph for the entire journey.

             To calculate the average speed of the train, we need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken.                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The train travels a total distance of 2 * 120 = 240 miles in 2 hours (at an average speed of 60 mph). So, the total distance is:                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now we need to find the time taken for each leg of the journey. The train travels a total distance of 80 miles in 1.5 hours at an average speed of 40 mph. So, the time taken is:
                                                                                                                                                                                 
80 miles / 40 mph = 2 hours                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The total time taken is:                                                                                                                                                         
2 hours * 2 = 4 hours                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now we can calculate the average speed for the entire journey by dividing the total distance traveled (120 miles) by the total time taken (4 hours). Therefore, the average speed
of the train is:                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
120 miles / 4 hours = 30 mph                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So, the train travels at an average speed of 30 mph for the entire journey.

The train travels a total distance of 2 * 120 = 240 miles in 2 hours (at an average speed of 60 mph). So, the total distance is:

Now we need to find the time taken for each leg of the journey. The train travels a total distance of 80 miles in 1.5 hours at an average speed of 40 mph. So, the time taken is:

80 miles / 40 mph = 2 hours

The total time taken is:
2 hours * 2 = 4 hours

Now we can calculate the average speed for the entire journey by dividing the total distance traveled (120 miles) by the total time taken (4 hours). Therefore, the average speed
of the train is:

120 miles / 4 hours = 30 mph

So, the train travels at an average speed of 30 mph for the entire journey.

             To calculate the average speed of the train, we need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken.                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The train travels a total distance of 2 * 120 = 240 miles in 2 hours (at an average speed of 60 mph). So, the total distance is:                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now we need to find the time taken for each leg of the journey. The train travels a total distance of 80 miles in 1.5 hours at an average speed of 40 mph. So, the time taken is:
                                                                                                                                                                                 
80 miles / 40 mph = 2 hours                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The total time taken is:                                                                                                                                                         
2 hours * 2 = 4 hours                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now we can calculate the average speed for the entire journey by dividing the total distance traveled (120 miles) by the total time taken (4 hours). Therefore, the average speed
of the train is:                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
120 miles / 4 hours = 30 mph                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So, the train travels at an average speed of 30 mph for the entire journey.

The train travels a total distance of 2 * 120 = 240 miles in 2 hours (at an average speed of 60 mph). So, the total distance is:

Now we need to find the time taken for each leg of the journey. The train travels a total distance of 80 miles in 1.5 hours at an average speed of 40 mph. So, the time taken is:

80 miles / 40 mph = 2 hours

The total time taken is:
2 hours * 2 = 4 hours

Now we can calculate the average speed for the entire journey by dividing the total distance traveled (120 miles) by the total time taken (4 hours). Therefore, the average speed
of the train is:

120 miles / 4 hours = 30 mph

So, the train travels at an average speed of 30 mph for the entire journey.

             To calculate the average speed of the train, we need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken.                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The train travels a total distance of 2 * 120 = 240 miles in 2 hours (at an average speed of 60 mph). So, the total distance is:                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now we need to find the time taken for each leg of the journey. The train travels a total distance of 80 miles in 1.5 hours at an average speed of 40 mph. So, the time taken is:
                                                                                                                                                                                 
80 miles / 40 mph = 2 hours                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The total time taken is:                                                                                                                                                         
2 hours * 2 = 4 hours                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now we can calculate the average speed for the entire journey by dividing the total distance traveled (120 miles) by the total time taken (4 hours). Therefore, the average speed
of the train is:                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
120 miles / 4 hours = 30 mph                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So, the train travels at an average speed of 30 mph for the entire journey.

             To calculate the average speed of the train, we need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken. 

The train travels a total distance of 2 * 120 = 240 miles in 2 hours (at an average speed of 60 mph). So, the total distance is:

60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles

Now we need to find the time taken for each leg of the journey. The train travels a total distance of 80 miles in 1.5 hours at an average speed of 40 mph. So, the time taken is:

80 miles / 40 mph = 2 hours

The total time taken is:
2 hours * 2 = 4 hours

Now we can calculate the average speed for the entire journey by dividing the total distance traveled (120 miles) by the total time taken (4 hours). Therefore, the average speed
of the train is:

120 miles / 4 hours = 30 mph

So, the train travels at an average speed of 30 mph for the entire journey.

[Step 21: Duration 13.41 seconds| Input tokens: 125,528 | Output tokens: 5,080]

Output:
To calculate the average speed of the train for the entire journey, we need to find the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken. 

The total distance is 120 miles + 80 miles = 200 miles.
The total time taken is 2 hours (from 120 miles in 2 hours) + 4 hours (from 80 miles in 1.5 hours). The total time is therefore 6 hours.

Therefore, the average speed for the entire journey is:

200 miles / 6 hours = 33.33 mph

Task 11 complete.
