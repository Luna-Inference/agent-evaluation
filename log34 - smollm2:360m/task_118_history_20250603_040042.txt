Here is a Python solution that uses the `datetime` module and `datetime` object to get the date of the end of World War II:

You can find the execution logs in your working directory to see if any invalid dates were raised or ignored during the process. The logs should contain details about what went 
wrong and any relevant errors that were encountered. You can access these logs using `logging.getlogger().debug('Your message here')` to get more information about the error    
messages.
