If you let go of a ball while holding it, there is no guarantee that it will fall due to gravity. However, if the object falls under certain conditions, such as when it reaches 
terminal velocity and has an initial velocity or inertia, then the following can occur:                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. **Gravity's influence**: The weight of the ball (which includes its mass) interacts with the Earth's gravitational force, causing the ball to fall towards the ground.        
2. **Acceleration due to gravity**: As the ball falls, it gains speed and starts to accelerate downward under the sole influence of gravity. This acceleration is a result of    
Newton's second law: F = ma, where F represents the net external force acting on an object (in this case, gravity) and m represents its mass.                                    
3. **Terminal velocity**: Once the ball reaches a certain speed called terminal velocity, it begins to slow down due to air resistance (drag). If there are no other forces      
acting upon the ball (like friction), then its acceleration will eventually cease when its weight is balanced by its inertia and the force of drag opposing gravity.             
4. **Deceleration**: As the ball decelerates under terminal velocity, it slows down until it finally comes to rest at a point where its initial upward velocity has been reduced 
by air resistance forces that counteract gravity. This occurs in an idealized case called an "inertial frame." In reality, objects do not fall uniformly under constant          
acceleration due to gravity; instead, they will continue falling unless acted upon by external forces like friction or air resistance.                                           
5. **Fall**: At this point, the ball has fallen a certain distance (usually referred to as its "fall") and now rests at that point.                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So in summary, if you let go of a ball while holding it, there is no guarantee that it will fall due to gravity. However, under idealized conditions with zero air resistance, an
object falling towards the ground following Newton's law of motion (F = ma) can decelerate until it comes to rest at its terminal velocity, which depends on factors like mass   
and initial speed.
