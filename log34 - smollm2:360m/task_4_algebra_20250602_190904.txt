To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation, which will get rid of the constant 
term.                                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So, let's start with the given equation:                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2x + 5 = 13                                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now, if we subtract 5 from both sides, we get:                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2x = 13 - 5                                                                                                                                                                      
2x = 8

We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So, let's divide both sides of the equation by 2:                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2x / 2 = 8 / 2                                                                                                                                                                   
x = 4                                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Therefore, the value of x is 4.

Now, if we subtract 5 from both sides, we get:

To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

2x + 5 = 13                                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now, if we subtract 5 from both sides, we get:                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2x = 13 - 5                                                                                                                                                                      
2x = 8                                                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So, let's divide both sides of the equation by 2:                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2x / 2 = 8 / 2                                                                                                                                                                   
x = 4                                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Therefore, the value of x is 4.

            Here is your code snippet:
            To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation, which will get rid of 
the constant term. 

So, let's start with the given equation:

2x + 5 = 13

Now, if we subtract 5 from both sides, we get:

2x = 13 - 5
2x = 8

To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

So, let's divide both sides of the equation by 2:

2x / 2 = 8 / 2
x = 4

Therefore, the value of x is 4.
