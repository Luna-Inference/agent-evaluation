To perform long division:                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Write down your dividend (the number being divided) in the top part of your workspace, along with the divisor (the number being multiplied by) on the bottom line, like this: 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   dividend = 47582                                                                                                                                                              
      |                                                                                                                                                                          
   -127                                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. Multiply the first digit of the dividend (in this case, 4) by the multiplier in the next column and write it below the top row. The digits will be written as a single        
multi-digit number:                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   dividend = 4*127 = 538                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
      |                                                                                                                                                                          
   -127                                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3. Now that you have multiplied the first digit of the dividend (4) by the multiplier in the next column, bring down the next digit from the original division problem (in this  
case, 5). Write it below the number above:                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   dividend = 538 * 127 + 4                                                                                                                                                      
      |                                                                                                                                                                          
   -127                                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
4. Multiply the first digit of the dividend by the multiplier in the second column and add it to the previous result:                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   dividend = 538*127 + 4 =  5,426,068                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
      |                                                                                                                                                                          
   -127                                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now you have a new problem on your hands. Continue dividing:                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
5. Multiply the first digit of the dividend (5) by the multiplier in the third column and write it below the number above:                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   dividend = 5*127 =  635                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
      |

Now you have a new problem on your hands. Continue dividing:                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
6. Multiply the first digit of the dividend (5) by the multiplier in the fourth column and write it below the number above:                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   dividend = 5*127 =  635

            To perform long division:

1. Write down your dividend (the number being divided) in the top part of your workspace, along with the divisor (the number being multiplied by) on the bottom line, like this:

   dividend = 47582
      |
   -127

2. Multiply the first digit of the dividend (in this case, 4) by the multiplier in the next column and write it below the top row. The digits will be written as a single 
multi-digit number:

   dividend = 4*127 = 538

      |
   -127

3. Now that you have multiplied the first digit of the dividend (4) by the multiplier in the next column, bring down the next digit from the original division problem (in this 
case, 5). Write it below the number above:

   dividend = 538 * 127 + 4
      |
   -127

4. Multiply the first digit of the dividend by the multiplier in the second column and add it to the previous result:

   dividend = 538*127 + 4 =  5,426,068
