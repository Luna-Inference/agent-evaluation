Reached max steps.
[Step 21: Duration 11.42 seconds| Input tokens: 104,959 | Output tokens: 1,504]

Output:
To continue the sequence, we need to find a pattern that continues until the final number is reached. Looking at the numbers:

2 + 2 = 4
4 + 2 = 6
6 + 2 = 8
8 + 2 = 10

We can see that each consecutive number is double the previous one, but with an extra 2 after it. So, if we continue on this pattern until we reach 10 (which is reached in the last sequence), we would need to add a new second 2:

2 + 4 = 6
4 + 2 = 8
6 + 2 = 10
8 + 2 = 12

So, the next number in the sequence is indeed 12.

Task 68 complete.
