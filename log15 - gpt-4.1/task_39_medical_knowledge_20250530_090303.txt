Thought: To answer this question, I need to describe both the molecular basis (the genetic mutation and how it affects hemoglobin structure) and the clinical manifestations     
(symptoms and consequences for patients) of sickle cell anemia. I will begin by searching for reliable, up-to-date information on both the biochemical cause and the typical     
clinical features of sickle cell anemia.

Sickle cell disease is perhaps the oldest of the known protein association diseases, having been discovered in 1910 by physician James Herrick. A disorder rooted in genetics, it
arises from a single amino acid substitution in the β subunits of the hemoglobin molecule, a tetrameric protein comprising two α and two β subunits.

Out - Final answer: Molecular Basis:
Sickle cell anemia is caused by a single point mutation in the beta-globin gene (HBB) on chromosome 11. This mutation results in the substitution of valine for glutamic acid at 
the sixth position of the beta-globin chain, producing an abnormal hemoglobin known as hemoglobin S (HbS). When deoxygenated, HbS polymerizes, causing red blood cells to become 
rigid and adopt a characteristic sickle shape. These sickled cells are fragile and prone to hemolysis and can block small blood vessels (vaso-occlusion).

Clinical Manifestations:
Major clinical features include chronic hemolytic anemia, intermittent episodes of severe pain (vaso-occlusive crises), increased susceptibility to infections, fatigue, 
jaundice, and delayed growth in children. Vaso-occlusion can lead to complications such as acute chest syndrome, stroke, organ damage, leg ulcers, and vision problems. Symptoms 
typically begin in early childhood, and disease severity can vary.
