[Earth radius - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_radius)
Earth radius (denoted as R 🜨 or R E) is the distance from the center of Earth to a point on or near its surface. Approximating the figure of Earth by an Earth spheroid (an 
oblate ellipsoid), the radius ranges from a maximum (equatorial radius, denoted a) of about 6,378 km (3,963 mi) to a minimum (polar radius, denoted b) of nearly 6,357 km (3,950 
mi).

[Earth mass - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_mass)
An Earth mass (denoted as M 🜨, M ♁ or M E, where 🜨 and ♁ are the astronomical symbols for Earth), is a unit of mass equal to the mass of the planet Earth.The current best 
estimate for the mass of Earth is M 🜨 = 5.9722 × 10 24 kg, with a relative uncertainty of 10 −4. [2] It is equivalent to an average density of 5515 kg/m 3.Using the nearest 
metric prefix, the Earth mass is ...

[Calculating the Mass of Earth: How Much Does Earth Weigh?](https://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/earth/geophysics/planet-earth-weigh.htm)
Calculating Earth's Mass. Assume that Earth is one of the masses (M1) and a 1-kg sphere is the other (M2). The force between them is 9.8 kg x m/s 2 — we can calculate this force
by dropping the 1-kilogram sphere and measuring the acceleration that the Earth's gravitational field applies to it (9.8 m/s 2).. The radius of the Earth is 6,400,000 meters 
(6,999,125 yards).

What scientists have spent centuries determining, however, is Earth's mass, which is its resistance to movement against an applied force. According to NASA , Earth's mass is 
5.9722×1024 kilograms ...

[Mass of the Earth - The Physics Factbook - The Physics Hypertextbook](https://hypertextbook.com/facts/2002/SamanthaDong2.shtml)
The Earth gains mass each day, as a result of incoming debris from space. This occurs in the forms of "falling stars", or meteors, on a dark night. The actual amount of added 
material depends on each study, though it is estimated that 10 to the 8th power kilograms of in-falling matter accumulates every day.

[How much does the Earth weigh? - Telescope Nerd](https://www.telescopenerd.com/celestial-objects/earth-weight.htm)
The weight of Earth in kg is not measured. Earth's mass, which is 5.9722 × 10^24 kg (1.316 × 10^25 lbs), is used to calculate its weight. Weight varies depending on location due
to gravity, while mass remains constant. The current best estimate for Earth's mass is 5.9722 × 10^24 kg (1.316 × 10^25 lbs).

[Convert Earth Masses to Kilograms - Sixus](https://sixus-converter.com/earth-mass/kilograms)
The mass of Earth is 5.9724×10 24 kilograms. Note: The values used in this converter are borrowed from the Planetary Fact Sheets. Some Facts. The major part of the mass of Earth
comes from atoms of iron and oxygen. Those two elements alone represent around 64% of the total mass (32% each). Then come atoms of magnesium and silicium at 15% each.

[How Much Does The Earth Weigh? | Mass, Weight, KG's, Pounds, Ton](https://nineplanets.org/questions/how-much-does-the-earth-weigh/)
On the other hand, weight measures how much gravity pulls down on the object. Mass stays the same no matter where it is, which means your mass is the same on Earth as it is 
anywhere else in space. ... Scientists say that Earth weighs around 6 x 10 24 kilograms, or 1.3 x 10 25 pounds. The actual size may be just slightly over this. That's ...

[What is Mass of the Earth? - The Environmental Literacy Council](https://enviroliteracy.org/what-is-mass-of-the-earth/)
The Current Value of Earth's Mass. The most current and widely accepted value for the mass of the Earth is approximately 5.972 × 10 24 kg. This is an enormous number, and it 
reflects the scale of our planet. While it's a single number, it encompasses the mass of all of Earth's components: the crust, mantle, core, oceans, and atmosphere.

[How Much Does the Earth Weigh? - Universe Today](https://www.universetoday.com/articles/how-much-does-the-earth-weigh)
Between its size, composition, and the distribution of its matter, the Earth has a mass of 5.9736×1024 kg (~5.97 billion trillion metric tons) or 1.31668×1025 lbs (6.585 billion
trillion tons).
