[Why does a skater spin faster when they pull their arms in?](https://physics-network.org/why-does-a-skater-spin-faster-when-they-pull-their-arms-in/)
Why do you spin slower with your arms out? Spinning takes energy. The momentum built up by a spinning figure skater is that same whether they have their limbs extended or pulled
in towards their body, but with their arms extended, their mass extends further from their center and their speed decreases to compensate.

[Eli5: Why ice-skaters rotate faster when they pull in?](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/t247jb/eli5_why_iceskaters_rotate_faster_when_they_pull/)
So the skater takes lots of energy to get up to a given spin speed with their arms outstretched. Then they pull their arms in and suddenly they have lower moment of inertia. But
they have the same angular momentum as before, so they must spin faster. You can try this yourself: hold a heavy object like a jug of milk at arms length and spin around.

[Why Do Figure Skaters Spin Faster With Their Arms In? - The Mary Sue](https://www.themarysue.com/figure-skaters-spinning-science/)
With their limbs pulled into their body, their momentum is conserved and they spin faster than with their arms extended. If you look at a spinning figure skater from above, it 
helps illustrate the ...

[How Do Figure Skaters Spin So Quickly? - Wonderopolis](https://www.wonderopolis.org/wonder/how-do-figure-skaters-spin-so-quickly)
This explains why a figure skater spins faster when she tucks her arms in close to her body. When she begins spinning with her arms away from her body, she has a large moment of
inertia because more of her mass is farther away from her axis of movement (her body). When she tucks her arms in close to her body, her moment of inertia decreases.

[physics test 2 conceptual Flashcards - Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/384753309/physics-test-2-conceptual-flash-cards/)
Why do figure skaters spin faster when they pull their arms in? The lower rotational inertia produced by pulling in the arms requires a larger rotational speed to conserve 
angular momentum. Newtons first law states that every object remains at rest or in motion in a straight line at constant speed unless acted on by an unbalanced force. Is this 
...

[How Ice Skaters Turn Physics Into Astonishing Spins - WIRED](https://www.wired.com/story/how-ice-skaters-turn-physics-into-astonishing-spins/)
The skater starts off in a standing position and spins about the vertical axis. After a few rotations, the skater pulls both arm in closer to the body and spins faster. In 
physics, we call this ...

[How Physics Keeps Figure Skaters Gracefully Aloft - Smithsonian 
Magazine](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/how-physics-keeps-figure-skaters-gracefully-aloft-180968051/)
When a skater performs a dazzling spin, they control their rotational speed by pulling their arms in to decrease the moment of inertia and speed up rotation or spreading them 
out to decrease ...

[Momentum Machine: Physics & Mechanics Science Activity | Exploratorium ...](https://www.exploratorium.edu/snacks/momentum-machine)
Quickly pull the masses in towards your body and notice that you rotate faster. ... The conservation of angular momentum explains why ice skaters start to spin faster when they 
suddenly draw their arms inward, or why divers or gymnasts who decrease their moment of inertia by going into the tuck position start to flip or twist at a faster rate.

[[FREE] Why does a figure skater spin faster when she has her arms ...](https://brainly.com/question/38246037)
A figure skater spins faster by pulling her arms closer due to the conservation of angular momentum, which keeps the total angular momentum constant. When her arms are extended,
her moment of inertia is higher, causing her to spin slower. Conversely, pulling her arms in decreases her moment of inertia, resulting in a faster spin.

[Why do skaters pull their arms inward when they spin? - SoHelp 
Science](https://scienceblogsohel.wixsite.com/sohelpscience/post/why-do-skaters-pull-their-arms-inward-when-they-spin)
When a figure skater pulls his/her arm in, the rotational inertia would decrease because R decreases. However, since total angular momentum must be conserved, if I (moment of 
inertia) decreases, ⍵ (angular velocity) must increase in order to keep the angular momentum constant. That's why the figure skaters spin faster when they pull their ...

Thought: The search results confirm the core physics principle involved: conservation of angular momentum. When the figure skater pulls their arms in, their moment of inertia   
decreases. To conserve angular momentum (which remains constant in the absence of external torque), the skater's rotational speed (angular velocity) increases. I will now       
formulate this explanation clearly and concisely as the final answer.
