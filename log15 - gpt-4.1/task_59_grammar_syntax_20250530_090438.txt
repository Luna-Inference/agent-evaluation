Thought: The request asks for an explanation of the difference between restrictive and non-restrictive relative clauses using "these examples." However, there are no examples   
provided in the message. To give a complete answer, I need to clarify whether specific example sentences were omitted or if I'm supposed to provide my own. I will check if there
are any context clues on this page or if not, proceed to explain the difference with standard sample sentences.

 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 
Out - Final answer: Restrictive relative clauses give essential information about the noun they modify. Without the clause, the meaning changes or becomes unclear. Example: 'The
students who studied hard passed the exam.' (Only the students who studied hard passed).

Non-restrictive relative clauses add extra, non-essential information. The main point remains clear if the clause is omitted. These clauses are separated by commas. Example: 'My
brother, who lives in Canada, is visiting us next week.' (The main idea: My brother is visiting; the clause 'who lives in Canada' is additional information).

Restrictive relative clauses give essential information about the noun they modify. Without the clause, the meaning changes or becomes unclear. Example: 'The students who studied hard passed the exam.' (Only the students who studied hard passed).

Non-restrictive relative clauses add extra, non-essential information. The main point remains clear if the clause is omitted. These clauses are separated by commas.
