To analyze the group dynamics in the described workplace scenario, I need to understand typical responses and theories related to how groups react when a new manager implements 
changes that meet resistance. Since no specific case details are provided, I will search for analysis and frameworks about group dynamics when a new leader initiates changes and
meets team resistance. I will use the web_search tool to find expert commentary or models about group dynamics in such situations.

The search results provide insight into group dynamics when a new manager implements changes that face resistance. Key factors include the importance of communication, group    
norms, established relationships, psychological ownership, and perceived threats to control or competence. It appears that group resistance stems from disruption to group       
cohesion, norms, and comfort, and that successful change management involves involving employees and supporting leader-member relationships. I will synthesize these findings and
provide a concise analysis based on the sources.

Out - Final answer: When a new manager implements changes, group dynamics frequently shift as established norms, roles, and relationships are challenged. Resistance can emerge 
because:
- Strong group norms or culture may make teams defensive against perceived disruptions (changecollaboration.com).
- Employees may feel lacking in control and experience the change as imposed, which creates psychological reactance (neurofied.com).
- Team sub-groups with misaligned practices and norms might resist blanket changes more strongly (mccombs.utexas.edu).
- The leader-member relationship is crucial; purposeful actions to build trust foster smoother transitions (pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).
- Open communication, opportunities for input, and recognizing expertise on the front lines help reduce resistance and foster buy-in (yourthoughtpartner.com, 
instituteprojectmanagement.com).

In summary, resistance often reflects the group's desire for stability, involvement, and acknowledgment. Best practices include engaging the team in dialogue, supporting 
autonomy, and addressing specific group concerns to gradually shift group dynamics in favor of change.
