Thought: To analyze this complex case and develop a comprehensive diagnostic workup, I first need access to the patient's details, including symptoms, lab results, and imaging  
studies. Since the task does not provide specific case details, I should check if they are available elsewhere or prompt for them. I will start by searching to see if additional
details are provided.

Thought: The search results only provided general diagnostic frameworks, strategies, and example case studies, but not a specific complex case with detailed lab results,        
imaging, and symptoms. Without these data, I cannot generate a targeted diagnostic workup. I need explicit patient details to proceed.                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So, the next step is to clarify that specific clinical information (such as symptoms, lab results, imaging findings) is needed to analyze the case and provide a comprehensive   
diagnostic workup.
