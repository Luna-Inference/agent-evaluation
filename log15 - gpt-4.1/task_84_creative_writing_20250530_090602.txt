Thought: I need to craft a compelling 500-word short story starting with the sentence provided: "The last person on Earth sat alone in a room. There was a knock on the door."   
I'll write the story in Python and count its words to ensure it is close to 500 words.                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Code:

story = """                                                                                                                                                                      
The last person on Earth sat alone in a room. There was a knock on the door.                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Evelyn’s breath caught. The stillness of months pressed all at once against her chest. Rain tap-tapped on the dirty window, but under it now vibrated something much more        
terrifying—a sound no wind or memory could have forged. Someone, or something, was reaching out.                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
She stared at the old door. Its paint was chipped, handle rusted. Once, she’d dreamt of another knock, a knock long ago—her mother, her brother or Sam from three houses down    
when the world was loud and ordinary. But those were voices left in the static days after the world’s edge.                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now, she existed in silence, her only companion the slow ticking of the clock and her own ceaseless thoughts. She tried to convince herself it was just the house shifting as it 
settled, but the knock came again. Sharper now. Expectant.                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Evelyn moved, footsteps the hush of a ghost and heart hammering. “Who is it?” she called, voice lost and small and strange to her ears.                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
No answer. Her trembling hand found the handle, cold under her palm. Another knock, softer—almost apologetic.                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
She opened the door.                                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
A child. Dirt-smudged, hair tangled, eyes shining a dark, bruised blue. The girl looked up at Evelyn, silent as a secret. Evelyn’s mind spun; this couldn’t be.                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
For so long, she’d lived as the end, the coda to civilization, finding riddles in old letters, stories in silence. The idea that someone else—anyone—could be here felt like a   
trick of hope.                                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
“Hello?” Evelyn whispered. “Are you real?”                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The girl nodded. “I’m lost,” she said, in a croak like an old hinge.                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
“Me too,” Evelyn managed, kneeling to her level, tears stinging her eyes. “Come in.”                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
They sat together in that room as the rain washed the world outside. The silence changed. It wasn’t empty now; it was full of slow, tentative questions, of a shared meal        
scavenged from old cans, of laughter awkward and rare, but there. Each word, each battered smile, chipped away at the walls of loneliness that Evelyn had thought permanent.     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
As dusk turned walls amber, Evelyn noticed the girl clutching something—an old, battered photograph. She showed it shyly: a cluster of children in a schoolyard, sunlight in     
their hair. “I hoped someone was left,” the girl said. “I thought if I knocked somewhere, maybe…”                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
She didn’t finish. She didn’t have to.                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Together, they scrawled names on the walls—names remembered, names invented, refusing the erasure of all who had been before and all they might become. Later, they pulled       
mattresses together and talked long after the electricity gave out, words tumbling through a darkness no longer so complete.                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Outside, the world remained broken and scarred, but inside, Evelyn and the girl made their own beginning. The last person on Earth wasn’t alone any longer.                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
And as the rain fell, they listened not for knocks, but for the tender, uncertain echo of hope.

  The last person on Earth sat alone in a room. There was a knock on the door.                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  Evelyn’s breath caught. The stillness of months pressed all at once against her chest. Rain tap-tapped on the dirty window, but under it now vibrated something much more      
  terrifying—a sound no wind or memory could have forged. Someone, or something, was reaching out.                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  She stared at the old door. Its paint was chipped, handle rusted. Once, she’d dreamt of another knock, a knock long ago—her mother, her brother or Sam from three houses down  
  when the world was loud and ordinary. But those were voices left in the static days after the world’s edge.                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  Now, she existed in silence, her only companion the slow ticking of the clock and her own ceaseless thoughts. She tried to convince herself it was just the house shifting as  
  it settled, but the knock came again. Sharper now. Expectant.                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  Evelyn moved, footsteps the hush of a ghost and heart hammering. “Who is it?” she called, voice lost and small and strange to her ears.                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  No answer. Her trembling hand found the handle, cold under her palm. Another knock, softer—almost apologetic.                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  She opened the door.                                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  A child. Dirt-smudged, hair tangled, eyes shining a dark, bruised blue. The girl looked up at Evelyn, silent as a secret. Evelyn’s mind spun; this couldn’t be.                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  For so long, she’d lived as the end, the coda to civilization, finding riddles in old letters, stories in silence. The idea that someone else—anyone—could be here felt like   
  a trick of hope.                                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  “Hello?” Evelyn whispered. “Are you real?”                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  The girl nodded. “I’m lost,” she said, in a croak like an old hinge.                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  “Me too,” Evelyn managed, kneeling to her level, tears stinging her eyes. “Come in.”                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  They sat together in that room as the rain washed the world outside. The silence changed. It wasn’t empty now; it was full of slow, tentative questions, of a shared meal      
  scavenged from old cans, of laughter awkward and rare, but there. Each word, each battered smile, chipped away at the walls of loneliness that Evelyn had thought permanent.   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  As dusk turned walls amber, Evelyn noticed the girl clutching something—an old, battered photograph. She showed it shyly: a cluster of children in a schoolyard, sunlight in   
  their hair. “I hoped someone was left,” the girl said. “I thought if I knocked somewhere, maybe…”                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  She didn’t finish. She didn’t have to.                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  Together, they scrawled names on the walls—names remembered, names invented, refusing the erasure of all who had been before and all they might become. Later, they pulled     
  mattresses together and talked long after the electricity gave out, words tumbling through a darkness no longer so complete.                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  Outside, the world remained broken and scarred, but inside, Evelyn and the girl made their own beginning. The last person on Earth wasn’t alone any longer.                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  And as the rain fell, they listened not for knocks, but for the tender, uncertain echo of hope.

The last person on Earth sat alone in a room. There was a knock on the door.

Evelyn’s breath caught. The stillness of months pressed all at once against her chest. Rain tap-tapped on the dirty window, but under it now vibrated something much more

Thought: The story is 491 words—slightly under the 500-word requirement. I need to expand it by around 9–15 words, ideally by fleshing out emotional beats or descriptions to    
maintain its tone and pace.

There was a knock on the door.                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Evelyn’s breath caught. The stillness of months pressed all at once against her chest. Rain tap-tapped on the dirty window, but under it now vibrated something much more        
terrifying—a sound no wind or memory could have forged. Someone, or something, was reaching out.                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
She stared at the old door. Its paint was chipped, handle rusted. Once, she’d dreamt of another knock, a knock long ago—her mother, her brother or Sam from three houses down    
when the world was loud and ordinary. But those were voices left in the static days after the world’s edge.                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now, she existed in silence, her only companion the slow ticking of the clock and her own ceaseless thoughts. Some nights she spoke aloud, just to hear a voice. She tried to    
convince herself it was just the house shifting as it settled, but the knock came again. Sharper now. Expectant.                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Evelyn moved, footsteps the hush of a ghost and heart hammering so loudly she was sure it would give her away. “Who is it?” she called, voice lost and small and strange to her  
ears.                                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
No answer. Her trembling hand found the handle, cold under her palm. Another knock, softer—almost apologetic.                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
She opened the door.                                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
A child. Dirt-smudged, hair tangled, eyes shining a dark, bruised blue. The girl looked up at Evelyn, silent as a secret. Evelyn’s mind spun; this couldn’t be.                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
For so long, she’d lived as the end, the coda to civilization, finding riddles in old letters, stories in silence. The idea that someone else—anyone—could be here felt like a   
trick of hope, too fragile to trust.                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
“Hello?” Evelyn whispered, hardly daring. “Are you real?”                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The girl nodded. “I’m lost,” she said, in a croak like an old hinge, blinking quickly as if the words themselves were a risk.                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
“Me too,” Evelyn managed, kneeling to her level, tears stinging her eyes. “Come in, please. You must be cold.”                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
They sat together in that room as the rain washed the world outside. The silence changed. It wasn’t empty now; it was full of slow, tentative questions, of a shared meal        
scavenged from old cans, of laughter awkward and rare, but there. Each word, each battered smile, chipped away at the walls of loneliness that Evelyn had thought permanent and  
unbreakable.                                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
As dusk turned walls amber, Evelyn noticed the girl clutching something—an old, battered photograph. She showed it shyly: a cluster of children in a schoolyard, sunlight in     
their hair, frozen forever in happiness. “I hoped someone was left,” the girl said. “I thought if I knocked somewhere, maybe…”                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
She didn’t finish. She didn’t have to.                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Together, they scrawled names on the walls—names remembered, names invented, refusing the erasure of all who had been before and all they might become. Later, they pulled       
mattresses together and talked long after the electricity gave out, words tumbling through a darkness no longer so complete or terrifying.                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Outside, the world remained broken and scarred, but inside, Evelyn and the girl made their own beginning. The last person on Earth wasn’t alone any longer.                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
And as the rain fell, and hope flickered, they listened not for knocks, but for the tender, uncertain echo of possibility—awakened at the edge of the world.

  her ears.                                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  No answer. Her trembling hand found the handle, cold under her palm. Another knock, softer—almost apologetic.                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  She opened the door.                                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  A child. Dirt-smudged, hair tangled, eyes shining a dark, bruised blue. The girl looked up at Evelyn, silent as a secret. Evelyn’s mind spun; this couldn’t be.                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  For so long, she’d lived as the end, the coda to civilization, finding riddles in old letters, stories in silence. The idea that someone else—anyone—could be here felt like   
  a trick of hope, too fragile to trust.                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  “Hello?” Evelyn whispered, hardly daring. “Are you real?”                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  The girl nodded. “I’m lost,” she said, in a croak like an old hinge, blinking quickly as if the words themselves were a risk.                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  “Me too,” Evelyn managed, kneeling to her level, tears stinging her eyes. “Come in, please. You must be cold.”                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  They sat together in that room as the rain washed the world outside. The silence changed. It wasn’t empty now; it was full of slow, tentative questions, of a shared meal      
  scavenged from old cans, of laughter awkward and rare, but there. Each word, each battered smile, chipped away at the walls of loneliness that Evelyn had thought permanent    
  and unbreakable.                                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  As dusk turned walls amber, Evelyn noticed the girl clutching something—an old, battered photograph. She showed it shyly: a cluster of children in a schoolyard, sunlight in   
  their hair, frozen forever in happiness. “I hoped someone was left,” the girl said. “I thought if I knocked somewhere, maybe…”                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  She didn’t finish. She didn’t have to.                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  Together, they scrawled names on the walls—names remembered, names invented, refusing the erasure of all who had been before and all they might become. Later, they pulled     
  mattresses together and talked long after the electricity gave out, words tumbling through a darkness no longer so complete or terrifying.                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  Outside, the world remained broken and scarred, but inside, Evelyn and the girl made their own beginning. The last person on Earth wasn’t alone any longer.                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  And as the rain fell, and hope flickered, they listened not for knocks, but for the tender, uncertain echo of possibility—awakened at the edge of the world.

The last person on Earth sat alone in a room. There was a knock on the door.

Evelyn’s breath caught. The stillness of months pressed all at once against her chest. Rain tap-tapped on the dirty window, but under it now vibrated something much more 
terrifying—a sound no wind or memory could have forged. Someone, or something, was reaching out.

She stared at the old door. Its paint was chipped, handle rusted. Once, she’d dreamt of another knock, a knock long ago—her mother, her brother or Sam from three houses down 
when the world was loud and ordinary. But those were voices left in the static days after the world’s edge.

Now, she existed in silence, her only companion the slow ticking of the clock and her own ceaseless thoughts. Some nights she spoke aloud, just to hear a voice. She tried to 
convince herself it was just the house shifting as it settled, but the knock came again. Sharper now. Expectant.

Evelyn moved, footsteps the hush of a ghost and heart hammering so loudly she was sure it would give her away. “Who is it?” she called, voice lost and small and strange to her 
ears.

No answer. Her trembling hand found the handle, cold under her palm. Another knock, softer—almost apologetic.

She opened the door.

A child. Dirt-smudged, hair tangled, eyes shining a dark, bruised blue. The girl looked up at Evelyn, silent as a secret. Evelyn’s mind spun; this couldn’t be.

condensing sentences but keeping the narrative structure and style intact.

Evelyn moved, footsteps the hush of a ghost and heart hammering so loudly she was sure it would give her away. “Who is it?” she called, voice lost and strange to her ears.      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
No answer. Her trembling hand found the handle, cold under her palm. Another knock, softer—almost apologetic.                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
She opened the door.                                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
A child. Dirt-smudged, hair tangled, eyes shining a dark, bruised blue. The girl looked up at Evelyn, silent as a secret. Evelyn’s thoughts spun; this couldn’t be.              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
She had lived as the end, the coda to civilization, finding riddles in old letters and stories in silence. The idea that someone else—anyone—could be here felt like a trick, too
fragile to trust.                                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
“Hello?” Evelyn whispered, hardly daring. “Are you real?”                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The girl nodded. “I’m lost,” she said, words croaking out, blinking as if the words themselves were a risk.                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
“Me too,” Evelyn managed, kneeling to her level, tears stinging her eyes. “Come in, please.”                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
They sat together as the rain washed the world outside. The silence changed. It wasn’t empty now; it was tentative questions, a shared meal scavenged from cans, laughter awkward
and rare. Each word, each battered smile, chipped away at the walls of loneliness Evelyn had thought permanent.                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
As dusk turned walls amber, Evelyn noticed the girl clutching something—an old photograph. She showed it shyly: a cluster of children in a schoolyard, frozen in happiness. “I   
hoped someone was left,” the girl said. “I thought if I knocked somewhere, maybe...”                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
She didn’t finish. She didn’t have to.                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Together, they scrawled names on the walls—names remembered, names invented, refusing the erasure of all who had been before. Later, they pulled mattresses together and talked  
long after electricity failed, words tumbling through a darkness no longer so complete.                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Outside, the world remained broken and scarred, but inside, Evelyn and the girl made a beginning. The last person on Earth wasn’t alone any longer.                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
And as the rain fell, hope flickered. They listened not for knocks, but for the uncertain echo of possibility awakening at the edge of the world.

  The last person on Earth sat alone in a room. There was a knock on the door.                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  Evelyn’s breath caught. The stillness of months pressed all at once against her chest. Rain tap-tapped on the dirty window, but under it now vibrated something much more      
  terrifying—a sound no wind or memory could have forged. Someone, or something, was reaching out.                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  She stared at the old door. Its paint was chipped, handle rusted. Once, she’d dreamt of another knock, long ago—her mother, her brother, or Sam from three houses down when    
  the world was loud and ordinary. But those were voices left behind in the static days after the world’s edge.                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  Now, she existed in silence, her only companion the slow ticking of the clock and her own ceaseless thoughts. Some nights she spoke aloud, just to hear a voice. She tried     
  convincing herself it was just the house shifting as it settled, but the knock came again. Sharper now. Expectant.                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  Evelyn moved, footsteps the hush of a ghost and heart hammering so loudly she was sure it would give her away. “Who is it?” she called, voice lost and strange to her ears.

  “Hello?” Evelyn whispered, hardly daring. “Are you real?”                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  The girl nodded. “I’m lost,” she said, words croaking out, blinking as if the words themselves were a risk.                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  “Me too,” Evelyn managed, kneeling to her level, tears stinging her eyes. “Come in, please.”                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  They sat together as the rain washed the world outside. The silence changed. It wasn’t empty now; it was tentative questions, a shared meal scavenged from cans, laughter      
  awkward and rare. Each word, each battered smile, chipped away at the walls of loneliness Evelyn had thought permanent.                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  As dusk turned walls amber, Evelyn noticed the girl clutching something—an old photograph. She showed it shyly: a cluster of children in a schoolyard, frozen in happiness.    
  “I hoped someone was left,” the girl said. “I thought if I knocked somewhere, maybe...”                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  She didn’t finish. She didn’t have to.                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  Together, they scrawled names on the walls—names remembered, names invented, refusing the erasure of all who had been before. Later, they pulled mattresses together and       
  talked long after electricity failed, words tumbling through a darkness no longer so complete.                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  Outside, the world remained broken and scarred, but inside, Evelyn and the girl made a beginning. The last person on Earth wasn’t alone any longer.

The last person on Earth sat alone in a room. There was a knock on the door.

Evelyn’s breath caught. The stillness of months pressed all at once against her chest. Rain tap-tapped on the dirty window, but under it now vibrated something much more 
terrifying—a sound no wind or memory could have forged. Someone, or something, was reaching out.

She stared at the old door. Its paint was chipped, handle rusted. Once, she’d dreamt of another knock, long ago—her mother, her brother, or Sam from three houses down when the 
world was loud and ordinary. But those were voices left behind in the static days after the world’s edge.

Now, she existed in silence, her only companion the slow ticking of the clock and her own ceaseless thoughts. Some nights she spoke aloud, just to hear a voice. She tried 
convincing herself it was just the house shifting as it settled, but the knock came again. Sharper now. Expectant.

Evelyn moved, footsteps the hush of a ghost and heart hammering so loudly she was sure it would give her away. “Who is it?” she called, voice lost and strange to her ears.

No answer. Her trembling hand found the handle, cold under her palm. Another knock, softer—almost apologetic.

She opened the door.

A child. Dirt-smudged, hair tangled, eyes shining a dark, bruised blue. The girl looked up at Evelyn, silent as a secret. Evelyn’s thoughts spun; this couldn’t be.

She had lived as the end, the coda to civilization, finding riddles in old letters and stories in silence. The idea that someone else—anyone—could be here felt like a trick, too
fragile to trust.

“Hello?” Evelyn whispered, hardly daring. “Are you real?”

The girl nodded. “I’m lost,” she said, words croaking out, blinking as if the words themselves were a risk.

“Me too,” Evelyn managed, kneeling to her level, tears stinging her eyes. “Come in, please.”                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
They sat together as the rain washed the world outside. The silence changed. It wasn’t empty now; it was tentative questions, a shared meal scavenged from cans, laughter awkward
and rare. Each word, each battered smile, chipped away at the walls of loneliness Evelyn had thought permanent.                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
As dusk turned walls amber, Evelyn noticed the girl clutching something—an old photograph. She showed it shyly: a cluster of children in a schoolyard, frozen in happiness. “I   
hoped someone was left,” the girl said. “I thought if I knocked somewhere, maybe...”                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
She didn’t finish. She didn’t have to.                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Together, they scrawled names on the walls—names remembered, names invented, refusing the erasure of all who had been before. Later, they pulled mattresses together and talked  
long after electricity failed, words tumbling through a darkness no longer so complete.                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Outside, the world remained broken and scarred, but inside, Evelyn and the girl made a beginning. The last person on Earth wasn’t alone any longer.                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
And as the rain fell, hope flickered. They listened not for knocks, but for the uncertain echo of possibility awakening at the edge of the world.

  The last person on Earth sat alone in a room. There was a knock on the door.                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  Evelyn’s breath caught. The stillness of months pressed all at once against her chest. Rain tap-tapped on the dirty window, but under it now vibrated something much more      
  terrifying—a sound no wind or memory could have forged. Someone, or something, was reaching out.                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  She stared at the old door. Its paint was chipped, handle rusted. Once, she’d dreamt of another knock, long ago—her mother, her brother, or Sam from three houses down when    
  the world was loud and ordinary. But those were voices left behind in the static days after the world’s edge.                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  Now, she existed in silence, her only companion the slow ticking of the clock and her own ceaseless thoughts. Some nights she spoke aloud, just to hear a voice. She tried     
  convincing herself it was just the house shifting as it settled, but the knock came again. Sharper now. Expectant.                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  Evelyn moved, footsteps the hush of a ghost and heart hammering so loudly she was sure it would give her away. “Who is it?” she called, voice lost and strange to her ears.    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  No answer. Her trembling hand found the handle, cold under her palm. Another knock, softer—almost apologetic.                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  She opened the door.                                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  A child. Dirt-smudged, hair tangled, eyes shining a dark, bruised blue. The girl looked up at Evelyn, silent as a secret. Evelyn’s thoughts spun; this couldn’t be.            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  She had lived as the end, the coda to civilization, finding riddles in old letters and stories in silence. The idea that someone else—anyone—could be here felt like a trick,  
  too fragile to trust.                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  “Hello?” Evelyn whispered, hardly daring. “Are you real?”                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  The girl nodded. “I’m lost,” she said, words croaking out, blinking as if the words themselves were a risk.                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  “Me too,” Evelyn managed, kneeling to her level, tears stinging her eyes. “Come in, please.”

She didn’t have to.

Out - Final answer: 
The last person on Earth sat alone in a room. There was a knock on the door.

Evelyn’s breath caught. The stillness of months pressed all at once against her chest. Rain tap-tapped on the dirty window, but under it now vibrated something much more 
terrifying—a sound no wind or memory could have forged. Someone, or something, was reaching out.

She stared at the old door. Its paint was chipped, handle rusted. Once, she’d dreamt of another knock, long ago—her mother, her brother, or Sam from three houses down when the 
world was loud and ordinary. But those were voices left behind in the static days after the world’s edge.

Now, she existed in silence, her only companion the slow ticking of the clock and her own ceaseless thoughts. Some nights she spoke aloud, just to hear a voice. She tried 
convincing herself it was just the house shifting as it settled, but the knock came again. Sharper now. Expectant.

Evelyn moved, footsteps the hush of a ghost and heart hammering so loudly she was sure it would give her away. “Who is it?” she called, voice lost and strange to her ears.

No answer. Her trembling hand found the handle, cold under her palm. Another knock, softer—almost apologetic.

She opened the door.

A child. Dirt-smudged, hair tangled, eyes shining a dark, bruised blue. The girl looked up at Evelyn, silent as a secret. Evelyn’s thoughts spun; this couldn’t be.

She had lived as the end, the coda to civilization, finding riddles in old letters and stories in silence. The idea that someone else—anyone—could be here felt like a trick, too
fragile to trust.

“Hello?” Evelyn whispered, hardly daring. “Are you real?”

The girl nodded. “I’m lost,” she said, words croaking out, blinking as if the words themselves were a risk.

“Me too,” Evelyn managed, kneeling to her level, tears stinging her eyes. “Come in, please.”

They sat together as the rain washed the world outside. The silence changed. It wasn’t empty now; it was tentative questions, a shared meal scavenged from cans, laughter awkward
and rare. Each word, each battered smile, chipped away at the walls of loneliness Evelyn had thought permanent.

As dusk turned walls amber, Evelyn noticed the girl clutching something—an old photograph. She showed it shyly: a cluster of children in a schoolyard, frozen in happiness. “I 
hoped someone was left,” the girl said. “I thought if I knocked somewhere, maybe...”

She didn’t finish. She didn’t have to.

Together, they scrawled names on the walls—names remembered, names invented, refusing the erasure of all who had been before. Later, they pulled mattresses together and talked 
long after electricity failed, words tumbling through a darkness no longer so complete.

Outside, the world remained broken and scarred, but inside, Evelyn and the girl made a beginning. The last person on Earth wasn’t alone any longer.

And as the rain fell, hope flickered. They listened not for knocks, but for the uncertain echo of possibility awakening at the edge of the world.
