Thought: To identify all subordinate clauses in the given sentence, I will first analyze the sentence structure and identify components introduced by subordinating conjunctions 
or relative pronouns ("Although", "that", "which"). I will then list out each of these subordinate clauses and their boundaries. To avoid confusion, I will break down the       
sentence manually and print the clauses for ease of reference.
