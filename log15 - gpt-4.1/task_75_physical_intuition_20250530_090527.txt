Thought: To answer this question, I need to consider the forces involved when pushing or pulling a box up a ramp, particularly the effect on the normal force and friction. When 
pulling, the applied force typically has an upward component that reduces the normal force and consequently the friction. When pushing, the applied force often adds to the      
normal force, which increases friction. I will explain this using physics principles.

Out - Final answer: It would generally be easier to pull the heavy box up the ramp rather than push it. When you pull the box, the force you apply usually has an upward 
component, which slightly reduces the normal force (the force the box presses into the ramp). Less normal force means less friction to overcome. When you push the box, the force
you apply often has a downward component, increasing the normal force and thus increasing the friction, making it harder to move the box up the ramp.

It would generally be easier to pull the heavy box up the ramp rather than push it. When you pull the box, the force you apply usually has an upward component, which slightly reduces the normal force (the force the box presses into the ramp). Less normal force means less friction to overcome.
