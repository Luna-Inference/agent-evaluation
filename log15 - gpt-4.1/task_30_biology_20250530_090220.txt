The mechanism of CRISPR/Cas-9 genome editing can be generally divided into three steps: recognition, cleavage, and repair. 13 The designed sgRNA directs Cas-9 and recognizes the
target sequence in the gene of interest through its 5ʹcrRNA complementary base pair component. The Cas-9 protein remains inactive in the absence of sgRNA.

The molecular mechanism of the CRISPR-Cas9 system-mediated genome-editing is illustrated in Figure 1. Cas9 is comprised of two nuclease domains: an HNH (His-Asn-His) nuclease 
which cleaves the target strand of DNA, and RuvC-like nuclease, which splits into RuvC-I, RuvC-II and RuvC-III subdomains and cleaves the nontarget strand.

Thought: The search results provide detailed information on the molecular mechanisms of CRISPR-Cas9. The process involves three primary steps: recognition (targeting), cleavage 
(DNA cutting by Cas9), and repair (cellular pathways repairing the double-strand break). The system involves the Cas9 protein (with HNH and RuvC nuclease domains) and a guide   
RNA (sgRNA) that recognizes the target sequence.

Out - Final answer: CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology is a genome engineering tool derived from a natural bacterial defense system. Its molecular mechanism involves the 
following steps:

1. Target Recognition: A single-guide RNA (sgRNA), composed of CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA), is designed to be complementary to a specific DNA 
sequence in the genome. The Cas9 protein binds the sgRNA to form a complex. This complex scans genomic DNA for a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), a short specific sequence 
required for target binding.

2. DNA Binding and Cleavage: Upon binding to the PAM and confirming sequence complementarity between the sgRNA and the target DNA, the Cas9 protein induces a conformational 
change that activates its nuclease domains: the HNH domain cuts the target DNA strand, while the RuvC domain cleaves the non-target strand, leading to a site-specific 
double-strand break (DSB) in the DNA.

3. DNA Repair: The cell detects the DSB and employs its natural repair mechanisms: either non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which may introduce small insertions or deletions 
(indels), or homology-directed repair (HDR) if a repair template is provided. These repairs can disrupt genes or precisely introduce or correct specific mutations.
