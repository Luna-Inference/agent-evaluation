Thought: To create a step-by-step plan for organizing a surprise birthday party for 20 people within a $500 budget, I need to consider the following steps: deciding the venue,  
food & drinks, decorations, invitations, entertainment/activities, and gifts/prizes. I also need to allocate the budget for each aspect while ensuring it adds up to $500 or     
less. I'll research cost-effective party ideas and typical pricing for each aspect to help inform the plan.                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I'll search for advice and sample plans for organizing a budget-friendly birthday party for 20 people, focusing on $500 budget tips.
