Thought: I will first use web_search to get the current stock price of Apple. Then, I'll check the same search or perform a secondary one if needed to find explanations for any 
recent significant changes in Apple's stock price. I'll print both so I can analyze and explain in the next step.

Thought: The search results provide several relevant sources for both the current stock price of Apple and recent significant changes. The latest stock price appears to be
