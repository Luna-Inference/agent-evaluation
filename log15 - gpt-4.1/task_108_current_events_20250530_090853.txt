The South China Sea has long been a flashpoint for regional tension, with competing territorial claims at the heart of a complex and evolving geopolitical struggle. Stretching 
from the Strait of Malacca to the Strait of Taiwan, this vital waterway includes hundreds of islands, reefs, and rocks, most notably in the Paracel and Spratly chains. The South
China Sea is a cornerstone of global trade, accounting for one-third of all maritime commerce and containing rich undersea resources like oil, natural gas, and 
fish.[[1]](#_ftn1) Beyond its economic significance, the region serves as a strategic chokepoint for international shipping and offers significant military leverage, making it a
flashpoint for sovereignty disputes and concerns over freedom of navigation and regional security.[[2]](#_ftn2) Territorial claims from Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, and 
China are driven by competing interests in sovereignty, security, and control over key shipping lanes. China’s aggressive military expansion in the region has heightened 
tensions, forcing neighboring nations to reevaluate their strategies and alliances. Meanwhile, the United States, though not a direct claimant, has voiced concerns about China’s
violations of fr

Thought: The second source provided substantial content and analysis. It highlights the importance of the South China Sea for global trade, undersea resources (oil, natural gas,
and fish), and its role as a strategic military chokepoint. Territorial claims from Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, and China are driven by interests in sovereignty, security,
and control of shipping lanes, while China's military expansion is intensifying the situation. U.S. involvement is also mentioned as a factor.                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The first source did not yield content directly related to the analysis. The third source could not be accessed due to an error. To add further depth, I will extract key points 
found so far and also check another accessible summary-oriented source (the CFR global conflict tracker page on the South China Sea), as it often compiles concise analyses.

China’s assertiveness in the South China Sea has steadily increased, resulting in heightened tensions with Southeast Asian claimant states, particularly the Philippines, at the 
Second Thomas Shoal in the Spratly Islands.

Background

China’s sweeping claims of sovereignty over the sea—and the sea’s estimated 11 billion barrels of untapped 
[oil](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/5-things-didnt-know-south-china-sea-conflict/)and 190 trillion cubic feet of [natural 
gas](http://www.eia.gov/countries/analysisbriefs/South_China_Sea/south_china_sea.pdf)—have antagonized competing claimants Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, 
and Vietnam. As early as the 1970s, countries began to

islands and various zones in the South China Sea, such as the Spratly Islands, which possess rich natural resources and fishing areas. The failure of Chinese and Southeast Asian
leaders to resolve the disputes diplomatically could undermine international laws governing maritime disputes and encourage destabilizing arms buildups.

[China maintains](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R42784.pdf) [PDF] that, under international law, foreign militaries cannot conduct intelligence-gathering activities, such as 
reconnaissance flights, in its exclusive economic zone (EEZ). According to the United States, c

- The South China Sea contains large reserves of untapped oil (estimated at 11 billion barrels) and natural gas (about 190 trillion cubic feet), as well as rich fishery stocks,
