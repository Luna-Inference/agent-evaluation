Cellular respiration is the process by which cells extract energy from glucose and other fuel molecules, converting it into ATP, the cell's main energy currency. The process    
occurs in three main stages:                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Glycolysis: This stage takes place in the cytoplasm. One molecule of glucose is broken down into two molecules of pyruvate, producing a small amount of ATP and NADH (an      
electron carrier).                                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. Citric Acid Cycle (Krebs Cycle): This occurs in the mitochondria. The pyruvate produced in glycolysis is further processed, releasing carbon dioxide and producing more NADH  
and another electron carrier called FADH2, as well as a small amount of ATP.                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3. Oxidative Phosphorylation (Electron Transport Chain): Also in the mitochondria, this stage uses the NADH and FADH2 from the previous stages to drive the production of a large
amount of ATP. Electrons are transferred through a series of proteins, ultimately combining with oxygen (the final electron acceptor) to form water.                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
This sequential process efficiently converts the chemical energy stored in glucose into the usable chemical energy of ATP.

Out - Final answer: 
Cellular respiration is the process by which cells extract energy from glucose and other fuel molecules, converting it into ATP, the cell's main energy currency. The process 
occurs in three main stages:

1. Glycolysis: This stage takes place in the cytoplasm. One molecule of glucose is broken down into two molecules of pyruvate, producing a small amount of ATP and NADH (an 
electron carrier).

2. Citric Acid Cycle (Krebs Cycle): This occurs in the mitochondria. The pyruvate produced in glycolysis is further processed, releasing carbon dioxide and producing more NADH 
and another electron carrier called FADH2, as well as a small amount of ATP.

3. Oxidative Phosphorylation (Electron Transport Chain): Also in the mitochondria, this stage uses the NADH and FADH2 from the previous stages to drive the production of a large
amount of ATP. Electrons are transferred through a series of proteins, ultimately combining with oxygen (the final electron acceptor) to form water.

This sequential process efficiently converts the chemical energy stored in glucose into the usable chemical energy of ATP.
