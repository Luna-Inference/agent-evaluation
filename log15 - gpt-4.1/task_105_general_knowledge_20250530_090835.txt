Out - Final answer: The Strait of Hormuz is a narrow waterway connecting the Persian Gulf with the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea.

Its strategic importance lies in the fact that It is the most important oil chokepoint in the world: about 20-30% of global oil trade (approximately 21 million barrels per day 
in 2022) passes through this strait. This means the economies of many nations are directly affected by its stability.

The strait is a persistent geopolitical flashpoint due to regional rivalries, particularly between Iran, its neighbors, and the United States. Iran controls much of the northern
coastline and has at times threatened to close the strait in response to international sanctions or military threats, which could cause disruptions in the global oil supply and 
lead to oil price spikes.

Frequent incidents—such as attacks on or seizure of oil tankers—demonstrate the vulnerability of this vital trade route. Any significant obstruction or closure of the strait 
would have profound global economic ramifications, as alternative routes are limited and less efficient.

In summary, the Strait of Hormuz is vital to global energy security, and disruptions there have widespread geopolitical and economic impacts.
