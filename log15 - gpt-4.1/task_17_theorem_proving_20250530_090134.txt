Thought:                                                                                                                                                                         
To prove that √2 is irrational by contradiction, I'll proceed step-by-step. First, I'll recall the method:                                                                       
- Assume √2 is rational (i.e., can be written as a fully reduced fraction a/b, where a and b are integers with no common factors other than 1, and b ≠ 0).                       
- Show this leads to a contradiction about the parity (even/oddness) or factorization of a and b.                                                                                
I will construct the proof in text and deliver it as the final answer.

Out - Final answer: Proof by contradiction that √2 is irrational:

Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that √2 is rational.
Then we can write √2 = a/b, where a and b are integers with no common factors other than 1 (i.e., the fraction is in lowest terms), and b ≠ 0.

Squaring both sides gives:
2 = a^2 / b^2
=> a^2 = 2b^2

This means that a^2 is even (since it's equal to 2 × b^2), so a itself must be even (since the square of an odd number is odd).
Therefore, let a = 2k for some integer k.

Substitute this back into the equation:
(2k)^2 = 2b^2
=> 4k^2 = 2b^2
=> 2k^2 = b^2

So b^2 is also even, and thus b is even.

But this means both a and b are even, which contradicts our original assumption that a/b is in lowest terms (since both are divisible by 2).

Therefore, our assumption that √2 is rational must be false. Thus, √2 is irrational.
