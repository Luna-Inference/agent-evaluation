The detailed steps in this playbook are based on proven best practices used in our work at Health Launchpad and on input from over 100 healthcare technology marketing leaders.

Today’s healthcare technology marketer faces unprecedented challenges. Extended buying cycles, complex stakeholder dynamics, and buyer-controlled purchasing journeys have 
transformed how healthcare organizations make technology decisions.

This is compounded by the constant pressure to deliver better results with less effort. And let’s face it. What used to work just doesn’t work as well as it used to. I’ve heard 
the frustrations firsthand in conversations with hundreds of healthcare marketing leaders.

That’s why we created this playbook—to provide you with practical, actionable strategies based on our collective experience and research from leading organizations.

This isn’t theoretical advice. Every recommendation comes from our hands-on work with healthcare technology companies that have successfully adapted to this new reality. We’ve 
distilled the approaches that drive results, creating a modern framework that can transform your marketing from lead generation to strategic pipeline growth.

My team and I are excited to share this with you and help you navigate today’s complex healthcare buying landscape.

Let us know how we can help.

Thought: The Table of Contents provides the key framework: 8 strategic steps for launching a B2B healthcare tech product. The step titles are visible and provide a logical      
outline upon which to base a detailed marketing strategy document. To enrich this document, I should briefly expand on each step using industry best practices—either by         
gathering more from this website, referencing the PDF guide from SpotOn Agency, or synthesizing what is known from my training data and observation.

the Health Launchpad playbook supplemented with my knowledge of B2B healthcare software marketing best practices. I will expand on each of the eight steps, ensure it is         
actionable and tailored for a healthcare audience, and cover key sections such as setting objectives, identifying personas, content strategy, ABM tactics, digital channel

## 1.

- **Segment the Market:** Prioritize sectors (e.g., hospitals, clinics, specialized practices, payers, pharma) with the highest need and tech adoption.                          
- **ICP Criteria:** Size (beds/staff), revenue, regulatory environment, IT maturity, pain points.                                                                                
- **Account Prioritization:** Use data tools (CRM, industry lists) to create a target account list for personalized outreach.
