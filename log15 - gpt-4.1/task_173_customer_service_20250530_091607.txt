Thought: To answer this, I should draft a polite and empathetic response to a customer whose order arrived late. The response should acknowledge the delay, apologize, possibly  
explain the reason (generically), and offer reassurance or compensation if appropriate. I will provide a sample response that could be used in such a situation.
