Thought: To handle this situation, I’ll first check for general recommendations or scripts for addressing escalated customer service refund requests for partially used products.
I want to find the best practice for responding, deciding whether a full refund should be offered, and how to communicate this empathetically and professionally. I will use     
web_search to find up-to-date examples and guidelines.

Thought: Since the web search is currently rate-limited and not available, I will draw on general customer service best practices for such situations. My response should        
acknowledge the customer's concerns, show empathy, review relevant policies (which I can mention as a general guideline), and propose a fair solution based on partial usage. If 
a full refund is not standard, I’ll offer alternatives like a partial refund or exchange, while maintaining professionalism and support.
