Thought: From the search results, I see the main points are: touching a hot stove will cause immediate pain and possibly a burn. This is because the nerves in the skin sense the
extreme heat and send rapid signals to withdraw your hand (reflex action), often before you consciously feel the pain. The physical reason is that high temperature damages skin 
cells, and the biological reason is to protect the body from further injury.
