Thought:                                                                                                                                                                         
I know the classical way to prove the undecidability of the halting problem is via reduction or contradiction, but you want an explicit diagonal argument. My plan is to reason  
and outline such a proof step-by-step. Specifically, I will write a clear diagonalization proof for the undecidability of the halting problem (i.e., that no Turing machine can  
decide whether an arbitrary Turing machine halts on a given input), and use the classical "table" approach as in Cantor's diagonal argument.                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Let me write this up clearly, showing the diagonal argument for the undecidability of the halting problem.

Let us prove that the Halting Problem is undecidable by a diagonalization argument.                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Recall:                                                                                                                                                                          
The Halting Problem is to decide, given a Turing machine M and input w, whether M halts when run on w. Formally, consider the set                                                
    HALT = { (M, w) | M is a Turing machine and M halts on input w }                                                                                                             
Is there a Turing machine (or algorithm) H that decides HALT for all (M, w)?                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Suppose for contradiction that such a decider H exists.                                                                                                                          
We can enumerate all Turing machines (M₀, M₁, ...) and all possible strings (w₀, w₁, ...), and thus enumerate all possible pairs (M_i, w_j). For simplicity, let us only consider
the case where w_j = j (i.e., the string is the code of the index), so each machine M_i on input i (its own index).                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now, imagine a table where the (i, j)-th entry is 1 if M_i halts on input w_j, 0 otherwise.                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Assume H can decide if M_i halts on w_j for any i, j.                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now, construct a new function D as follows:                                                                                                                                      
    On input n:                                                                                                                                                                  
        If H(M_n, n) says that M_n halts on input n, then D enters an infinite loop.                                                                                             
        If H(M_n, n) says that M_n does not halt on input n, then D halts immediately.                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
That is,

        if H(n, n):

        else:                                                                                                                                                                    
            halt                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
But D itself is a Turing machine, so it must be M_k for some k.                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now ask: does D(k) halt?                                                                                                                                                         
- If H(k, k) says "yes" (M_k halts on input k), then by construction, D(k) does NOT halt (it loops forever).                                                                     
- If H(k, k) says "no" (M_k does NOT halt on input k), then by construction, D(k) does halt.                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
This is a contradiction—H cannot correctly decide for input (D, k). Therefore, H cannot exist, and the Halting Problem is undecidable.                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
This argument is an explicit diagonalization: the function D is constructed by flipping the entry at each "diagonal" element (M_n, n), ensuring D differs from every M_n at input
n.

  Let us prove that the Halting Problem is undecidable by a diagonalization argument.                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  Recall:                                                                                                                                                                        
  The Halting Problem is to decide, given a Turing machine M and input w, whether M halts when run on w. Formally, consider the set                                              
      HALT = { (M, w) | M is a Turing machine and M halts on input w }                                                                                                           
  Is there a Turing machine (or algorithm) H that decides HALT for all (M, w)?                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  Suppose for contradiction that such a decider H exists.                                                                                                                        
  We can enumerate all Turing machines (M₀, M₁, ...) and all possible strings (w₀, w₁, ...), and thus enumerate all possible pairs (M_i, w_j). For simplicity, let us only       
  consider the case where w_j = j (i.e., the string is the code of the index), so each machine M_i on input i (its own index).                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  Now, imagine a table where the (i, j)-th entry is 1 if M_i halts on input w_j, 0 otherwise.                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  Assume H can decide if M_i halts on w_j for any i, j.                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  Now, construct a new function D as follows:                                                                                                                                    
      On input n:                                                                                                                                                                
          If H(M_n, n) says that M_n halts on input n, then D enters an infinite loop.                                                                                           
          If H(M_n, n) says that M_n does not halt on input n, then D halts immediately.                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  That is,

  But D itself is a Turing machine, so it must be M_k for some k.                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  Now ask: does D(k) halt?

Out - Final answer: 
Let us prove that the Halting Problem is undecidable by a diagonalization argument.

Recall:
The Halting Problem is to decide, given a Turing machine M and input w, whether M halts when run on w. Formally, consider the set
    HALT = { (M, w) | M is a Turing machine and M halts on input w }
Is there a Turing machine (or algorithm) H that decides HALT for all (M, w)?

Suppose for contradiction that such a decider H exists.
We can enumerate all Turing machines (M₀, M₁, ...) and all possible strings (w₀, w₁, ...), and thus enumerate all possible pairs (M_i, w_j). For simplicity, let us only consider
the case where w_j = j (i.e., the string is the code of the index), so each machine M_i on input i (its own index).

Now, imagine a table where the (i, j)-th entry is 1 if M_i halts on input w_j, 0 otherwise.

Assume H can decide if M_i halts on w_j for any i, j.

Now, construct a new function D as follows:
    On input n:
        If H(M_n, n) says that M_n halts on input n, then D enters an infinite loop.
        If H(M_n, n) says that M_n does not halt on input n, then D halts immediately.

That is,
    D(n):
        if H(n, n):
            loop forever
        else:
            halt

But D itself is a Turing machine, so it must be M_k for some k.

Now ask: does D(k) halt?
- If H(k, k) says "yes" (M_k halts on input k), then by construction, D(k) does NOT halt (it loops forever).
- If H(k, k) says "no" (M_k does NOT halt on input k), then by construction, D(k) does halt.

This is a contradiction—H cannot correctly decide for input (D, k). Therefore, H cannot exist, and the Halting Problem is undecidable.

This argument is an explicit diagonalization: the function D is constructed by flipping the entry at each "diagonal" element (M_n, n), ensuring D differs from every M_n at input
n.
