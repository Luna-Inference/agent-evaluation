To find and fix the race condition, I need to review a representative code snippet of the multi-threaded banking application. Usually, race conditions in such scenarios arise   
when multiple threads perform deposits/withdrawals concurrently on shared account balances without proper synchronization. I will start by searching for a common race condition 
sample in multi-threaded banking code, then explain and fix it with proper synchronization (e.g., using locks).

By definition, a race condition is a condition of a program where its behavior depends on relative timing or interleaving of multiple threads or processes. One or more possible 
outcomes may be undesirable, resulting in a bug. We refer to this kind of behavior as nondeterministic. Thread-safe is the term we use to describe a program, code, or data

From the search results, I see many references to a classic banking race condition: multiple threads accessing and modifying a shared account balance. Typically, the issue      
occurs when updates to a balance are not atomic, leading to inconsistent or incorrect values. The usual way to fix this is to introduce a lock (or synchronized block) to ensure 
only one thread can access the critical section at a time. I'll write a Python example using `threading.Lock` to demonstrate both the issue and the fix.

The previous code failed because importing `threading` is not allowed. Since I cannot use actual threads, I need to pivot: I will illustrate (in code and explanation) where the 
race condition happens, and show the fix conceptually. I'll provide code that simulates what happens when two "threads" (represented by function calls, not real threads)        
interleave. Then, I'll explain how using a lock would fix this, even if I can't use `threading.Lock`.

Execution logs:
Final balance (should be 100; race condition result): 90
To fix the race condition, protect the critical section (balance update) with a mutex/lock, so only one thread can perform read-modify-write at a time. For example in Python you
would do:
with lock:
    temp = self.balance
    temp += amount
    self.balance = temp
This ensures consistency even with concurrent operations.

Thought:                                                                                                                                                                         
The simulation demonstrates how a race condition can occur in a multi-threaded banking application: concurrent deposit and withdrawal operations, if not synchronized, can lead  
to an incorrect account balance (e.g., 90 instead of the correct 100). The fix is to use a lock to protect the critical section so only one thread can update the balance at a   
time. Since I cannot use threads or locks here, I have explained and illustrated the principle.
