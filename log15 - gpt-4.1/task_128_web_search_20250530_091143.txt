Thought: To answer this task, I need to first identify the top 3 electric vehicles in 2024, and then find recent reviews and ratings for each of them. I will start with a web   
search for the top 3 electric vehicles of 2024. Once I have their names, I will search for recent reviews and ratings for each vehicle individually.

Thought: From the search results, several sources consistently mention top 2024 EVs. The Kelley Blue Book (KBB) article specifically lists the “2024 Hyundai IONIQ 6,” “2024     
Nissan LEAF,” and “2024 MINI Hardtop 2 Door” as their highest-rated models. However, Cars.com named the 2024 Hyundai Ioniq 5 as the best EV of 2024, and other sources highlight 
the Kia EV6 and Tesla Model Y. To proceed, I will visit the KBB link for their specific top 3, as they directly answer which 3 EVs they rate highest for 2024. After confirming  
these are the most authoritative, I’ll move on to searching recent reviews and ratings for each.
