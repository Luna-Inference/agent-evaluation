[Mitochondria: Form, function, and disease - Medical News Today](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320875)
Mitochondria are often referred to as the powerhouses of the cell. Their main function is to generate the energy necessary to power cells. But, there is more to mitochondria 
than energy production.

[Mitochondrion | Definition, Function, Structure, & Facts | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/science/mitochondrion)
The number of mitochondria per cell varies widely—for example, in humans, erythrocytes (red blood cells) do not contain any mitochondria, whereas liver cells and muscle cells 
may contain hundreds or even thousands. The only eukaryotic organism known to lack mitochondria is the oxymonad Monocercomonoides species. Mitochondria are unlike other cellular
organelles in that they have two distinct ...

[Mitochondria - Definition, Structure, Function - Science Notes and ...](https://sciencenotes.org/mitochondria-definition-structure-function/)
Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell that produce chemical energy (ATP) through oxidative phosphorylation. Learn about their discovery, structure, functions, ribosomes, 
and location in different cells.

[Mitochondria - cell powerhouses — Science Learning Hub](https://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/resources/1839-mitochondria-cell-powerhouses)
Mitochondria are the organelles that produce energy (ATP) from food in cells. Learn how they work, what role they play in ageing and disease, and how to keep them healthy with 
lifestyle and diet.

[Mitochondria Definition - BYJU'S](https://byjus.com/biology/mitochondria/)
Popularly known as the "Powerhouse of the cell," mitochondria (singular: mitochondrion) are a double membrane-bound organelle found in most eukaryotic organisms.They are found 
inside the cytoplasm and essentially function as the cell's "digestive system." They play a major role in breaking down nutrients and generating energy-rich molecules for the 
cell.

[Why Mitochondria Are More like a Motherboard Than the Powerhouse of the 
...](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-mitochondria-are-more-like-a-motherboard-than-the-powerhouse-of-the-cell/)
The host cell had no energy source that used oxygen—which, thanks to plants, was already abundant in the atmosphere; mitochondria filled this gap.

[Why is Mitochondria known as Power house of the Cell?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/why-is-mitochondria-known-as-power-house-of-the-cell/)
Mitochondria is the powerhouse of cells, mitochondria form the energy of the cell i.e. ATP, also from some proteins which are required for proper functioning of mitochondria. 
Question 2: What is apoptosis? Answer: Programmed cell death is known as apoptosis. When a cell is aged then it automatically signals cascade run which leads to cell death.

[Mitochondria: The Powerhouse of the Cell Explained](https://onlyzoology.com/mitochondria-the-powerhouse-of-the-cell-explained/)
Learn how mitochondria produce ATP, the primary energy currency of the cell, through oxidative phosphorylation. Discover their other functions, such as metabolic regulation, 
calcium signaling, apoptosis, and ROS management, and their role in cellular health and disease.

[Why the mitochondria is called the powerhouse of the cell?](https://www.studyecentre.com/2024/07/why-mitochondria-is-called-of-cell.html)
Mitochondria are called the "powerhouse of the cell" because they are responsible for producing the majority of the cell's energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), 
which powers virtually all cellular activities. The nickname arises from their role in converting chemical energy from nutrients into a usable form of energy that the cell ...

[Mitochondria: The Powerhouse of the Cell - PreachBio](https://www.preachbio.com/2024/02/mitochondria-powerhouse-of-cell.html)
3. Function of Mitochondria as the Powerhouse of the Cell. Mitochondria play a crucial role in cellular respiration, a process that involves the conversion of nutrients into 
ATP, which cells use as a source of energy for various metabolic activities. This earned them the nickname "powerhouse of the cell." 4. ATP Production in Mitochondria
