(rock types, structures, processes) and geography (landforms, elevation, etc.).

[The Himalayas [This Dynamic Earth, USGS]](https://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/dynamic/himalaya.html)
Among the most dramatic and visible creations of plate-tectonic forces are the lofty Himalayas, which stretch 2,900 km along the border between India and Tibet. This immense 
mountain range began to form between 40 and 50 million years ago, when two large landmasses, India and Eurasia, driven by plate movement, collided.

The Himalayas are a prime example of how tectonic plate motion can manipulate the earth in extraordinary ways. These colliding plates resulted in the formation of the highest 
mountain range on the ...

The geology of the Himalayas is a record of the most dramatic and visible creations of the immense mountain range formed by plate tectonic forces and sculpted by weathering and 
erosion.The Himalayas, which stretch over 2400 km between the Namcha Barwa syntaxis at the eastern end of the mountain range and the Nanga Parbat syntaxis at the western end, 
are the result of an ongoing orogeny — the ...

[Plate Tectonics - National Geographic Society](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/plate-tectonics/)
Plate tectonics is a scientific theory that explains how major landforms are created as a result of Earth's subterranean movements. The theory, which solidified in the 1960s, 
transformed the earth sciences by explaining many phenomena, including mountain building events, volcanoes, and earthquakes. In plate tectonics, Earth's outermost layer, or 
lithosphere —made up of the crust and ...

[How Does Plate Tectonics Affect the Earth?](https://enviroliteracy.org/how-does-plate-tectonics-affect-the-earth/)
The Himalayas, the highest mountain range on Earth, are a prime example of this process. They were formed by the collision of the Indian and Eurasian plates millions of years 
ago and continue to rise even today. ... The movement of tectonic plates is not smooth; rather, they often become stuck along fault lines, where the plates grind against ...

The two plates were now being pushed against one another in what would be called a convergent plate boundary environment. There are two kinds of convergent plate boundaries. One
is an ocean-continent convergent plate boundary, in which the water-heavy oceanic slab is subducted underneath the lighter continental slab.

This last observation is the "Rosetta Stone" for plate tectonic theory. It provides a means by which continents can drift apart. Instead of plowing directly over mantle, the 
continents are "passengers" on the tops of much thicker plates. The plates of crust and stiff mantle (lithosphere) move on the softer mantle layer beneath ...

Thought: The key points from authoritative sources confirm that the Himalayas were formed by the collision of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates, and this process continues
today, shaping their geology (ongoing uplift, rock types, folding) and geography (high peaks, earthquakes).

Out - Final answer: The Himalayas have been shaped by the powerful movement of tectonic plates. Around 40 to 50 million years ago, the Indian Plate, moving northward, collided 
with the Eurasian Plate. Unlike oceanic-continental collisions where one plate is subducted, both plates were continental and buoyant, so neither was fully subducted. Instead, 
the collision caused the crust to crumple, fold, and uplift dramatically, forming the vast Himalayan mountain range.

This tectonic collision is ongoing: the Indian Plate continues to push into the Eurasian Plate, causing the Himalayas to rise by several millimeters per year. The region's 
geology is characterized by complex folds, faults, and varied rock types, including marine sediments that were uplifted from the ancient Tethys Sea. The geography—towering peaks
like Mount Everest, deep valleys, and frequent earthquakes—directly results from these tectonic forces. Thus, the movement and collision of Earth's plates created and continue 
to shape both the geology and dramatic geography of the Himalayas.
