Thought: To answer this question, I need to briefly explain the historical development of analytics in baseball, highlight major turning points (such as the rise of             
sabermetrics), and provide specific examples of how analytics changed both player evaluation (how teams value/assess players) and game strategy (how the game is played). I will 
use a web search to find authoritative and up-to-date explanations and examples.

Thought: I was able to retrieve some content from the refrsports.com article, which specifically mentions sabermetrics, Bill James, and the movement's impact on player          
evaluation and strategy. The other visited page did not yield substantive baseball content, and the third link returned an error. I will now search for more details, synthesize 
what sabermetrics is, summarize how analytics shifted player evaluation (e.g., traditional stats vs. modern metrics), and how it changed game strategy (for example, defensive   
shifts, bullpen usage, etc). I will check for additional details in another promising article from my original search.

Evolution of Baseball Analytics: From Basics to Advanced Metrics
================================================================

Baseball has long been America’s favorite pastime, a sport that combines endurance, skill, and strategy in a way that has captivated audiences for over a century. While the 
rules and fundamental aspects of the game have remained largely consistent, the way we analyze the game has evolved dramatically. The early days of baseball analytics were 
simple and straightforward, relying on basic statistics like batting averages, home runs, and ERA (Earned Run Average). As the sport grew in popularity and complexity, so did 
the methods of analysis. Today, advanced metrics and sophisticated algorithms offer a deeper, more nuanced understanding of the game.

This evolution of baseball analytics is more than just a shift in how numbers are crunched. It represents a transformative change in how the game is played, managed, and 
appreciated. From the earliest days of tallying up basic statistics to

Thought: I now have confirmation that early analytics in baseball relied on basic stats like batting average and ERA, and that the field has since evolved into using advanced   
metrics and sophisticated algorithms. My previous extraction from refrsports.com covered the definition and intent of sabermetrics. To fully answer the prompt, I will synthesize
a concise explanation covering: (a) the traditional vs. modern analytics eras, (b) how sabermetrics initiated a revolution, (c) concrete changes in player evaluation, and (d)

Out - Final answer: The evolution of analytics in baseball has radically changed the sport over the last several decades. Traditionally, teams evaluated players using basic 
statistics such as batting average, home runs, and earned run average (ERA). However, the rise of sabermetrics in the late 20th century—driven by pioneers like Bill 
James—ushered in a new era. 'Sabermetrics' refers to the empirical analysis of baseball through advanced statistics, moving beyond surface-level numbers to evaluate true player 
value, team performance, and optimal strategies.

Player evaluation changed drastically: metrics like on-base percentage (OBP), slugging percentage (SLG), wins above replacement (WAR), and fielding independent pitching (FIP) 
became standard. These allow teams to uncover undervalued talent and better predict future performance, shifting the focus from traditional stats to holistic contributions. Game
strategy also evolved: analytics led to increased use of defensive shifts (positioning fielders according to batter tendencies), optimized batting lineups, greater emphasis on 
pitch counts and bullpen matchups, and data-driven roster moves.

In short, analytics turned baseball into a more data-driven game, revolutionizing both player evaluation and on-field strategy, and continues to shape the sport as technology 
and data evolve.
