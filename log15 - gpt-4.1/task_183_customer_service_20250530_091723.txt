Thought: To create a comprehensive customer retention strategy for a SaaS company with high churn, I'll need to research best practices as well as common causes and preventative
methods for churn in SaaS. I'll look for credible, recent sources about SaaS retention and summarize actionable strategies, possibly structuring them as steps, principles, or   
recommendations. First, I’ll use web_search to collect information on customer retention strategies specifically for SaaS companies experiencing high churn.

Thought: The previous attempt failed due to a rate limit on the search function. To avoid hitting an error again, I will try a more focused query to see if a narrower search    
reduces rate limiting. Instead of seeking a comprehensive strategy in one go, I will search for "best practices to reduce churn for SaaS companies," which may give more targeted
and accessible results.

Thought: Due to repeated rate limiting on the web_search tool, I should avoid external search for now and instead rely on internal knowledge and best practices regarding SaaS   
customer retention. I will outline a comprehensive, actionable retention strategy including key components such as onboarding, product engagement, customer support, feedback    
loops, and at-risk customer interventions.

1. Diagnose and Analyze Churn:                                                                                                                                                   
   - Collect detailed churn analytics to identify when and why users leave (e.g., feature gaps, pricing, onboarding failure).                                                    
   - Segment churned customers by type, usage, and lifecycle stage.

   - Streamlined onboarding with guided tutorials, tooltips, and personal assistance for new users.                                                                              
   - Proactive check-ins during the first 30 days using automated emails or CSM outreach.                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3. Increase Product Engagement:                                                                                                                                                  
   - Identify sticky features and encourage their use through prompts and in-app messaging.                                                                                      
   - Gamify engagement; provide personalized dashboards to showcase user progress and value.                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
4. Proactive Customer Support:                                                                                                                                                   
   - Offer multi-channel, responsive support (chat, email, phone).
