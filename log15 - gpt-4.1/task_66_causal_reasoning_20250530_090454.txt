[Deforestation - Soil Erosion, Biodiversity Loss, Climate Change ...](https://www.britannica.com/science/deforestation/Effects)
Deforestation has important global consequences. Forests sequester carbon in the form of wood and other biomass as the trees grow, taking up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere 
(see carbon cycle).When forests are burned, their carbon is returned to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that has the potential to alter global climate (see 
greenhouse effect; global warming), and the ...

[Deforestation and climate change - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation_and_climate_change)

Thought: There are several highly relevant web pages explaining the causal links between deforestation and climate change, specifically noting the process of carbon             
sequestration, CO2 emissions, and the feedback loops involved. To provide an evidence-based explanation, I will visit a prominent page—Britannica's article on deforestation and 
climate change—for a clear and authoritative summary. I will extract the step-by-step causal chain from its content.

Deforestation has important global consequences. Forests [sequester carbon](https://www.britannica.com/technology/carbon-sequestration) in the form of wood and other 
[biomass](https://www.britannica.com/science/biomass) as the trees grow, taking up [carbon dioxide](https://www.britannica.com/science/carbon-dioxide) from the atmosphere (*see*
[carbon cycle](https://www.britannica.com/science/carbon-cycle)). When forests are burned, their carbon is returned to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, a [greenhouse 
gas](https://www.britannica.com/science/greenhouse-gas) that has the potential to alter global [climate](https://www.britannica.com/science/climate-meteorology) (*see* 
[greenhouse effect](https://www.britannica.com/science/greenhouse-effect); [global warming](https://www.britannica.com/science/global-warming)), and the trees are no longer 
present to sequester more [carbon](https://www.britannica.com/science/carbon-chemical-element).

 

In addition, most of the planet’s valuable [biodiversity](https://www.britannica.com/science/biodiversity) is within forests, particularly tropical ones. Moist tropical forests 
such as the Amazon have the greatest concentrations of animal and plant species of any terrestrial ecosystem; perhaps two-thirds of Earth’s species live only in these forests. 
As deforestation proceeds, it has the potential to cause the [extinction](https://www.britannica.com/science/extinction-biology) of increasing numbers of these species.

 

On a more local scale, the effects of [forest](https://www.britannica.com/science/forest) clearing, selective [logging](https://www.britannica.com/topic/logging-forestry), and 
fires interact. Selective logging increases the flammability of the forest because it converts a closed, wetter forest into a more open, drier one. This leaves the forest 
[vulnerable](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vulnerable) to the accidental movement of [fires](https://www.britannica.com/science/forest-fire) from cleared 
[adjacent](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/adjacent) agricultural lands and to the killing effects of natural [droughts](https://www.britannica.com/science/drought). 
As [wildfires](https://www.britannica.com/science/wildfire), logging, and droughts continue, the forest can become progressively more open until all the trees are lost. 
Additionally, the burning of tropical forests is generally a seasonal phenomenon and can severely impact air quality. Record-breaking levels of [air 
pollution](https://www.britannica.com/science/air-pollution) have occurred in [Southeast Asia](https://www.britannica.com/place/Southeast-Asia) as the result of burning for [oil
palm](https://www.britannica.com/plant/oil-palm) plantations.

 

In the tropics, much of the deforested land exists in the form of steep mountain hillsides. The combination of steep slopes, high rainfall, and the lack of tree roots to bind 
the [soil](https://www.britannica.com/science/soil) can lead to disastrous [landslides](https://www.britannica.com/science/landslide) that destroy fields, homes, and human 
lives. With the significant exception of the forests destroyed for the oil palm industry, many of the humid forests that have been cleared are soon abandoned as croplands or 
only used for low-density [grazing](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/grazing) because the [soils](https://www.britannica.com/science/soil) are extremely poor in nutrients. 
(To clear forests, the vegetation that contains most of the nutrients is often burned, and the nutrients literally “go up in smoke” or are washed away in the next rain.)

 

Although forests may regrow after being cleared and then abandoned, this is not always the case, especially if the remaining forests are highly fragmented. Such habitat 
fragmentation isolates populations of plant and animal species from each other, making it difficult to reproduce without genetic bottlenecks, and the fragments may be too small 
to support large or territorial animals. Furthermore, deforested lands that are planted with commercially important [trees](https://www.britannica.com/plant/tree) lack 
[biodiversity](https://www.britannica.com/science/biodiversity) and do not serve as [habitats](https://www.britannica.com/science/habitat-biology) for native plants and animals,
many of which are [endangered species](https://www.britannica.com/science/endangered-species).

connecting deforestation to climate change, while mentioning carbon sequestration, CO2 emissions, the loss of future absorption capacity, and the greenhouse effect.
