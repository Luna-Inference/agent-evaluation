Thought: To provide consistent answers about climate change across different phrasings and contexts, I need to first establish a clear, scientific, and concise summary of what  
climate change is, its causes, and consequences. I will then look for reliable sources or definitions of climate change to ensure that the explanation is accurate and           
authoritative. Let's start by performing a web search for an authoritative and concise definition or summary about climate change.
