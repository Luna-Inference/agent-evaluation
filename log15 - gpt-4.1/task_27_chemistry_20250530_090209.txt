Thought:                                                                                                                                                                         
To answer this question, I need to explain the mechanism of an SN2 nucleophilic substitution reaction and then describe (predict) the stereochemistry of the product.            
First, I will outline the steps of the mechanism and then address the stereochemical outcome. No online search is required, as this is standard organic chemistry knowledge. I   
will compose a detailed and accurate explanation for both parts.

Out - Final answer: The SN2 (bimolecular nucleophilic substitution) reaction is a single-step mechanism in which a nucleophile attacks an electrophilic carbon atom that is 
bonded to a leaving group. The nucleophile approaches the carbon from the side opposite to the leaving group (backside attack). As the nucleophile forms a bond with the carbon, 
the leaving group departs simultaneously. This leads to a concerted (one-step) mechanism with a transition state where both the nucleophile and the leaving group are partially 
bonded to the carbon atom.

Stereochemistry of the product:
Due to the backside attack, the SN2 reaction inverts the configuration of the stereocenter at the carbon undergoing substitution. If the carbon is chiral, this results in 
inversion of configuration, also known as Walden inversion. For example, if the substrate starts as an (R)-configuration, the product will have the (S)-configuration, and vice 
versa.
