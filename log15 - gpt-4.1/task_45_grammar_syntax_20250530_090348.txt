Thought: To identify the subject and predicate of the sentence, I will first recall basic grammar. The subject is typically the noun/noun phrase performing the action and the   
predicate is what is said about the subject (typically starting with the verb and including the rest). I will parse the sentence myself and verify with a quick web search for   
"subject and predicate of The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog".
