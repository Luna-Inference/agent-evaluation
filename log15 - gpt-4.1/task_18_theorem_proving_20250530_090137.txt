Euclid's proof that there are infinitely many prime numbers:                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that there are only finitely many primes. Let us list all of them: p_1, p_2, ..., p_n.                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. Consider the number Q = p_1 * p_2 * ... * p_n + 1; that is, multiply all primes together and add 1.                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3. Now, Q is either prime or composite.                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
    - If Q is itself prime, then it is a new prime, not in our original list, contradicting the assumption that we listed all primes.                                            
    - If Q is composite, then it must have some prime factor. However, none of p_1, ..., p_n divides Q without remainder, since dividing Q by any of the p_i leaves a remainder  
of 1.                                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
4. Therefore, Q has a prime factor not in our original list, again contradicting the assumption that we had found all primes.                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
5. Thus, the assumption that there are finitely many primes leads to a contradiction.                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Conclusion: There must be infinitely many primes.

Out - Final answer: 
Euclid's proof that there are infinitely many prime numbers:

1. Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that there are only finitely many primes. Let us list all of them: p_1, p_2, ..., p_n.

2. Consider the number Q = p_1 * p_2 * ... * p_n + 1; that is, multiply all primes together and add 1.

3. Now, Q is either prime or composite.

    - If Q is itself prime, then it is a new prime, not in our original list, contradicting the assumption that we listed all primes.
    - If Q is composite, then it must have some prime factor. However, none of p_1, ..., p_n divides Q without remainder, since dividing Q by any of the p_i leaves a remainder 
of 1.

4. Therefore, Q has a prime factor not in our original list, again contradicting the assumption that we had found all primes.

5. Thus, the assumption that there are finitely many primes leads to a contradiction.

Conclusion: There must be infinitely many primes.
