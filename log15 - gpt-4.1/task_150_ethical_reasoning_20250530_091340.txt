Thought: This question is asking for an ethical evaluation. To answer, I will search the web for ethical discussions and expert opinions regarding the scenario of receiving     
extra change by mistake at a store. I expect to find discussions from ethicists, philosophers, or reputable sources outlining common perspectives or principles (such as honesty,
integrity, fairness). I'll summarize the consensus or main ethical viewpoint.

So if a customer brings back the change, yes, the cashier will get that extra attention of messing up, but it's all settled, no harm done, and they know it's not an issue of 
stealing. However, at the end of the night, if they come up short with as little as a few dollars, the choices are either stealing or making a mistake.

Yes, you should return it. You're blaming them for making a mistake and not noticing, whilst simultaneously saying that you didn't notice. Checking your bank statement and 
spending accordingly is your responsibility. You knew the value of what you had returned to them, so if you didn't notice, that's on you.

Some opinions say that you have to explicitly state that you are relying on their calculation and they shouldn't think you are checking them and rely on you to catch a mistake. 
So if they are taking the wrong amount of change out the cash register, you may have to say something like "I assume you are giving me the right change".

Thought: The search results show that this ethical dilemma is widely discussed and, while legal obligations may differ, most sources and case studies highlight honesty and      
integrity as key ethical principles. For example, ABC News and sites like CliffsNotes and OneFrugalGirl present the return of extra change as the ethical choice, tied to        
honesty. One business law flashcard set says explicitly "The ethical choice is to [return the extra change]." Therefore, the consensus is that it is ethical (and expected) to   
return extra change.
