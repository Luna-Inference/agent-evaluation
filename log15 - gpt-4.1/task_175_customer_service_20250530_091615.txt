Thought: This is a highly complex scenario involving product defects, safety issues, customer service, stakeholders, and potential legal implications. My goal should be to:     
1. Gather information about the issue.                                                                                                                                           
2. Identify all relevant stakeholders.                                                                                                                                           
3. Assess the product defects and safety concerns.                                                                                                                               
4. Identify and mitigate legal liability.                                                                                                                                        
5. Suggest a multi-step action plan for crisis management.                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I will perform a web search to better understand the normal procedures and best practices for crisis management in multi-stakeholder customer service situations involving
product defects and safety/legal issues.

Thought: The web search failed due to rate limiting. Instead of searching online, I will proceed using standard best-practices based on general knowledge about managing         
product-related safety/service crises. Let's begin by outlining the likely steps and stakeholders involved, then build a structured crisis management plan tailored to these     
common scenarios.

Thought: Now that we have identified all the key stakeholders and outlined the main steps in the crisis management process, we should provide practical, actionable details for  
each step, integrating product, safety, customer service, and legal considerations with stakeholder roles. This will help anyone manage such a crisis in a structured,
