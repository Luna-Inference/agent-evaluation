<think>                                                                           
Okay, the user is asking for the boiling point of water in Celsius. I remember    
from basic science that at standard atmospheric pressure, water boils at 100      
degrees Celsius. But maybe I should verify this with a reliable source.           
                                                                                  
Wait, the tools available include web search. So I should use the web_search      
function to check the current information. Let me structure the code: perform a   
web search for "boiling point of water in Celsius" and retrieve the top result.   
Then extract the temperature from the result and return it.                       
                                                                                  
I need to make sure the search is accurate. The user might expect the standard    
answer, but perhaps the search results could have different contexts. However,    
since the question is straightforward, the standard answer is 100°C. But to be    
precise, using the web search would confirm it. So the code will search for the   
exact phrase and then output the result.                                          
</think>                                                                          
                                                                                  
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the boiling point of water in     
Celsius.
