Okay, the user is asking for the capital of France. That's a straightforward question. I know that the capital of France is
Paris, but I should verify this using the available tools to ensure accuracy.                                              
                                                                                                                           
First, I can use the web_search tool to look up the information. Let me perform a search for "capital of France". The tool 
should return the top results, which should confirm that Paris is the capital.                                             
                                                                                                                           
Alternatively, I could use the wiki tool, but since the question is so common, a web search is probably quicker and        
sufficient. Let me proceed with that.
