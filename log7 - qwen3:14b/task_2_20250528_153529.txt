Okay, I need to make sure I follow the correct format. The user is asking for the author of "Pride and Prejudice," and all 
the search results point to Jane Austen. Since the previous attempts had formatting issues, I should use the final_answer

First, I'll confirm the answer based on the search results. Then, I'll structure the code correctly using the final_answer 
function with the answer as a string. No more markdown, just the code snippet as specified.
