<think>                                                                                     
Okay, the user is asking about the Pythagorean theorem. I need to explain it clearly. Let me
think about how to approach this.                                                           
                                                                                            
First, the Pythagorean theorem is a fundamental principle in geometry. It relates to        
right-angled triangles. The theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of   
the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the
other two sides. So, if the sides are a and b, and the hypotenuse is c, then a² + b² = c².  
                                                                                            
I should probably outline the theorem, give an example, and maybe mention its historical    
context. But since the user just wants the theorem explained, I need to make sure the       
explanation is accurate and concise.                                                        
                                                                                            
Wait, the user didn't specify if they need a formula, a proof, or an application. But the   
question is straightforward, so the answer should be the theorem itself. However, the tools 
available are web search and other functions. Maybe I can use the web_search tool to get the
information.                                                                                
                                                                                            
But the user might expect a direct answer. Let me check the tools again. The available tools
are web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer. Since the user is asking for the theorem,  
which is a known fact, I can directly answer using the final_answer tool. However, to ensure
accuracy, perhaps using web_search to confirm the theorem's statement.                      
                                                                                            
But the user's question is a general knowledge question. The Pythagorean theorem is a       
well-established fact. So, I can directly state the theorem. However, to be thorough, maybe 
use web_search to get the latest information or a more detailed explanation.                
                                                                                            
Wait, the tools are not for providing general knowledge. The web_search function would      
return the top results. Let me try using web_search with the query "Pythagorean theorem" to 
get the most relevant result. Then, use the final_answer to present the answer based on that
search result.                                                                              
                                                                                            
So the steps would be: perform a web search for the Pythagorean theorem, retrieve the top   
result, and then present the answer. But since the user is asking for the theorem, which is 
a standard fact, maybe the search result would be the theorem's statement. However, to      
ensure correctness, it's better to use the search tool.                                     
                                                                                            
But the user might expect a direct answer without searching. However, since the assistant is
supposed to use the tools provided, I need to proceed accordingly.                          
                                                                                            
So, the code would be:                                                                      
                                                                                            
Use web_search with the query "Pythagorean theorem" to get the result, then extract the     
relevant part and use final_answer to present it.                                           
</think>                                                                                    
                                                                                            
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to retrieve the Pythagorean theorem's statement and 
then present it as the final answer.                                                        
Code:                                                                                       
```py                                                                                       
pythagorean_theorem = web_search(query="Pythagorean theorem")                               
final_answer(pythagorean_theorem)
