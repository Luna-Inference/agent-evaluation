<think>                                                                                     
Okay, the user is asking who the first female Nobel laureate was. I need to figure out how  
to find that information. Let's think about the tools available. The user mentioned using   
the web search tool, so maybe I can use that to look up Nobel laureates and find the first  
female.                                                                                     
                                                                                            
First, I should perform a web search to find the list of Nobel laureates and then identify  
the first woman. But how exactly to structure this? Maybe use the web_search function with a
query like "Nobel laureates first female". Then, parse the results to find the answer.      
                                                                                            
Wait, the tools provided include web_search and visit_webpage. So I can call web_search with
the query, get the top results, and then check the content. But since the web_search returns
a string, I need to process that string to find the answer.                                 
                                                                                            
Alternatively, maybe there's a more direct way. But given the tools, the best approach is to
search for the first female laureate. Let's proceed step by step.                           
                                                                                            
First, perform a web search for "first female Nobel laureate". Then, extract the information
from the search results. The answer should be someone like Marie Curie, but I need to       
confirm.                                                                                    
                                                                                            
Wait, Marie Curie was the first female to win a Nobel Prize, but she won in 1903 for Physics
and Chemistry. But the question is about the first female laureate in general, so maybe     
she's the answer. However, I need to make sure that the search results confirm this.        
                                                                                            
So the code would be to call web_search with the query, then parse the results to find the  
name. But how to handle the parsing? Since the web_search returns a string, I can look for  
the name in that string.                                                                    
                                                                                            
Alternatively, maybe the search results will directly state the answer. Let's try the code. 
</think>                                                                                    
                                                                                            
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the first female Nobel laureate and then    
extract the answer from the search results.                                                 
Code:

first_female_nobel = web_search(query="first female Nobel laureate")
