<think>                                                                                     
Okay, the user is asking who is known as the father of computers. I need to figure out the  
answer. Let me think.                                                                       
                                                                                            
From what I remember, the term "father of computers" is often associated with Alan Turing.  
He's widely recognized for his work on early computer concepts, like the Turing machine and 
the Universal Turing Machine. But I should verify this.                                     
                                                                                            
I should use the web search tool to check the current information. Let me perform a search  
for "father of computers" to confirm the answer. The search results might mention Alan      
Turing. Alternatively, there might be other figures, but I think Turing is the most         
prominent one.                                                                              
                                                                                            
Wait, the user might be looking for a more specific answer. Maybe the question is a trick   
question, but the answer is definitely Alan Turing. Let me make sure by searching.          
</think>                                                                                    
                                                                                            
Thought: I will use the web search tool to find the answer to "who is known as the father of
computers" and confirm the correct individual.
