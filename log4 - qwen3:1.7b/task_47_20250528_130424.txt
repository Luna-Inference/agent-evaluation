<think>                                                                                     
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Australia. I need to find that out. Let me think
about the tools I have.                                                                     
                                                                                            
Hmm, the available tools are web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer. So maybe I should 
use web_search with the query "capital of Australia". Let me check if that's possible. The  
web_search function takes a query string, so I can directly input that.                     
                                                                                            
Wait, the user might want the most recent information. Let me perform the search. The code  
would be something like:                                                                    
                                                                                            
pope_age_wiki = wiki(query="current pope age")                                              
print("Pope age as per wikipedia:", pope_age_wiki)                                          
pope_age_search = web_search(query="current pope age")                                      
print("Pope age as per google search:", pope_age_search)                                    
                                                                                            
But for this task, it's about the capital. So the code should be:                           
                                                                                            
capital = web_search("capital of Australia")                                                
final_answer(capital)                                                                       
                                                                                            
But I need to make sure the web_search returns the correct result. Let me execute that.     
</think>                                                                                    
                                                                                            
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the capital of Australia.                   
Code:                                                                                       
```py                                                                                       
capital = web_search(query="capital of Australia")                                          
final_answer(capital)
