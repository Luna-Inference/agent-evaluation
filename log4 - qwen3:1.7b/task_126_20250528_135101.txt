Okay, the user is asking for the capital of New Zealand. Let me think about how to approach this.                                   
                                                                                                                                    
First, I know that the capital of New Zealand is Wellington. But maybe I should verify this using a reliable source. Since the user 
might want the most accurate answer, I should check a credible database or website.                                                 
                                                                                                                                    
Looking at the tools available, there's the 'wiki' function which can search for information. So I'll use that to look up the       
capital of New Zealand. The wiki tool can provide factual information.                                                              
                                                                                                                                    
I'll call the wiki function with the query "capital of New Zealand". Then, I'll retrieve the result and return it as the final      
answer.                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                    
Wait, the tools mentioned include 'wiki' and 'web_search'. The 'wiki' function might be more direct. Let me make sure to use the    
correct parameters. The query should be straightforward.                                                                            
                                                                                                                                    
Once I get the result from the wiki, I can print it and confirm that it's Wellington. Then, I can use the final_answer tool to      
present the answer.                                                                                                                 
</think>

Okay, the user is asking for the capital of New Zealand. Earlier, I tried using the `wiki` tool but encountered an error because the
tool wasn't allowed. Now, I need to find another way to get the correct answer without using the `wiki` function.                   
                                                                                                                                    
Since the capital of New Zealand is well-known, I can directly answer based on general knowledge. However, to comply with the tool  
constraints, I should use a different approach. Maybe check the web search results directly using the `web_search` tool to retrieve 
the information.                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                    
I'll use the `web_search` function with the query "capital of New Zealand" to get the top result. Then, I'll extract the answer from
the search results and return it as the final answer.
