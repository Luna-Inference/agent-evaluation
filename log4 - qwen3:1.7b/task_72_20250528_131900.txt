<think>                                                                                                                             
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Italy. I need to find that out. Let me think about the tools I have.                    
                                                                                                                                    
Hmm, the available tools are web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer. Since the question is straightforward, maybe a web search 
would work. I can use the web_search function with the query "capital of Italy". Let me check if there's a need to visit a specific 
webpage. But the user didn't mention any particular source, so a general search should suffice.                                     
                                                                                                                                    
Wait, the tools don't have a specific country capital database, so the web_search would return the top results. The observation     
would then show the top result, and I can extract the capital from there. But according to the rules, I need to make sure I don't   
use any notional variables and use the tools correctly. So I'll proceed with the web_search, then process the result to get the     
capital.                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                    
Code steps: Call web_search with the query, then parse the result to find the capital. Then use final_answer with the extracted     
capital. Let me write the code.                                                                                                     
</think>
