<think>                                                                                                                             
Okay, the user is asking for the main ingredient in tiramisu. I need to figure out what the answer is. From what I remember,        
tiramisu is typically made with a layer of pasta or cake, and then topped with a sauce. The main ingredients are usually the pasta, 
egg, and milk. But I should verify this.                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                    
Wait, maybe I should check a reliable source. But since I can't actually browse the internet, I need to use the tools provided. The 
available tools are web_search and visit_webpage. So I should use web_search to look up the ingredients of tiramisu.                
                                                                                                                                    
Let me structure the code. First, perform a web search for "main ingredient in tiramisu". Then, extract the information from the    
search results. The answer should be the primary ingredient, which is probably the pasta. But I need to make sure. The search       
results might list the ingredients, so I'll parse the first result.                                                                 
                                                                                                                                    
Alternatively, maybe the answer is straightforward. If the search returns something like "The main ingredients are pasta, egg, and  
milk," then that's the answer. But I need to ensure that the search results are accurate. Since I can't check, I'll proceed with the
search and then provide the answer based on the retrieved information.                                                              
</think>                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                    
Thought: I will use the `web_search` tool to find the main ingredients of tiramisu and then extract the answer from the search      
results.
