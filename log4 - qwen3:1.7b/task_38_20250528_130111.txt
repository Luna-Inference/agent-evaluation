<think>                                                                                     
Okay, the user is asking who painted the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. I need to figure out
how to find this information. Let me think about the tools I have.                          
                                                                                            
First, I remember that there's a tool called 'wiki' which can search for information. Maybe 
I can use that to look up the Sistine Chapel's ceiling. But I should also consider if       
there's a more specific tool. The user might expect a direct answer, so I need to make sure 
I get the correct information.                                                              
                                                                                            
Wait, the tools available are web_search and visit_webpage. Maybe using web_search with the 
query "Who painted the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel?" would be effective. Alternatively,   
the wiki tool could provide a concise answer. Let me try the wiki first.                    
                                                                                            
I'll call the wiki function with the query. If the wiki returns the correct information, I  
can use that. If not, I'll use web_search. But according to the rules, I should only use the
tools provided. The user might have expected a specific answer, so I need to ensure         
accuracy.                                                                                   
                                                                                            
Another thought: the Sistine Chapel's ceiling is famously painted by Michelangelo. But I    
should verify this through the tools. Let me check using the wiki tool first.

Thought: I will use the `wiki` tool to search for information about who painted the ceiling 
of the Sistine Chapel.                                                                      
Code:

Okay, the user is asking who painted the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. I tried using the   
wiki tool but got an error because 'wiki' isn't allowed. The previous attempt used a        
different approach, so I need to find another way.                                          
                                                                                            
Since the wiki tool isn't available, I'll use the web_search function. Let me search for the
answer directly. The Sistine Chapel's ceiling is famously painted by Michelangelo, but I    
need to confirm this through a web search.                                                  
                                                                                            
I'll perform a web search with the query "Who painted the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel?"   
and then retrieve the results. If the search returns the correct information, I can extract 
the answer. If not, maybe I need to try a different search term, but given the constraints, 
I'll proceed with the current approach.
