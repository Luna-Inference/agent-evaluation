<think>                                                                                                                             
Okay, the user is asking who wrote "Jane Eyre". I need to figure out how to find this information. Let me think about the tools     
available.                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                    
First, I remember that the user has access to a few tools: web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer. The web_search function can 
be used to look up information. Since the question is about a book, a web search should work. The book "Jane Eyre" is a classic     
novel, so the search should return the author's name.                                                                               
                                                                                                                                    
I should use the web_search tool with the query "Who wrote Jane Eyre?". The result should give the author, which I think is         
Charlotte Brontë. But I need to make sure the search returns the correct information. Let me check the search results.              
                                                                                                                                    
Wait, the user's tools don't have a specific book search function, so I have to rely on the web_search. The code would be something 
like:                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                    
result = web_search("Who wrote Jane Eyre?")                                                                                         
final_answer(result)                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                    
But I need to make sure the search returns the correct answer. If the search returns the author's name, then the final answer is    
straightforward. If not, maybe I need to refine the query. But given the tools, this should be sufficient.                          
</think>                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                    
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the author of "Jane Eyre" and then return the final answer.
