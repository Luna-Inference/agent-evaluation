Okay, the user is asking for the chemical symbol of copper. I need to figure out what that is. From what I remember, copper is a    
metal, and its symbol is Cu. But maybe I should verify this using a reliable source.                                                
                                                                                                                                    
Hmm, the tools available include web search and wiki. So I can use the web_search function to look up the chemical symbol of copper.
Let me construct the query. The user might want the most accurate answer, so a direct search should work.                           
                                                                                                                                    
I'll call the web_search function with the query "chemical symbol for copper". Then, the result should give the correct symbol. Once
I get the answer, I can present it as the final answer.                                                                             
</think>                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                    
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the chemical symbol for copper.
