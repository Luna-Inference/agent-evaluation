Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Cyprus. Let me think about how to approach this.                                        
                                                                                                                                    
First, I know that Cyprus is a country in Europe, and its capital is Nicosia. But maybe I should verify this using a reliable       
source. Since the user might want the most accurate information, I should check a credible database or a trusted website.           
                                                                                                                                    
Looking at the tools available, there's the 'wiki' function which can be used to look up information. So I'll use the wiki tool with
the query "capital of Cyprus" to get the correct answer.                                                                            
                                                                                                                                    
Wait, the tools mentioned include 'wiki' and 'web_search'. The 'wiki' function might provide the most straightforward answer. Let me
call that first.                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                    
I'll write a code snippet that uses the wiki tool with the query "capital of Cyprus". Then, I'll print the result to confirm. If the
wiki returns the correct capital, I can directly use that in the final answer. If not, maybe I need to do a web search, but given   
that Nicosia is the known capital, I think the wiki should give the correct answer.                                                 
</think>                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                    
Thought: I will use the `wiki` tool to find the capital of Cyprus.

Okay, the previous attempt tried using the 'wiki' tool, but the system reported an error saying that 'wiki' is not among the allowed
tools. Hmm, maybe the tools available are limited, and I can't use the wiki function. Let me think of another way to find the       
answer.                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                    
Since I can't use external tools like wiki, maybe I can rely on my knowledge. I remember that Cyprus's capital is Nicosia. But to be
sure, perhaps I can check a web search. However, the user's tools include web_search, so I should use that.                         
                                                                                                                                    
Let me try using the web_search tool with the query "capital of Cyprus" to get the answer. That should work since the system allowed
web_search.

Okay, the user asked for the capital of Cyprus. From the web search results, I see that Nicosia is the capital. The previous attempt
had an error because the code was invalid. Let me make sure the code is correct.                                                    
                                                                                                                                    
The user's last attempt had an error in the code parsing. The code was supposed to use the final_answer function. Let me structure  
the code properly. The correct approach is to use the web_search tool to find the answer and then use final_answer with the result. 
Since the web_search already returned "Nicosia" as the capital, I can directly use that in the final answer.                        
                                                                                                                                    
So the code should be:                                                                                                              
```py                                                                                                                               
final_answer("Nicosia")                                                                                                             
```                                                                                                                                 
This avoids any unnecessary steps and ensures the answer is provided correctly.

The capital of Cyprus is Nicosia.                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                    
Final Answer: Nicosia
