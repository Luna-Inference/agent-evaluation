Okay, the user is asking for the freezing point of water in Celsius. I remember from basic science that water freezes at 0 degrees  
Celsius. But let me make sure I'm not missing anything here.                                                                        
                                                                                                                                    
Hmm, the question seems straightforward. The freezing point of water is a standard scientific fact. So the answer should be 0°C. But
maybe I should verify using a tool to ensure accuracy. Wait, the tools available include wiki and web_search. Let me use the wiki   
tool to confirm.                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                    
I'll call the wiki function with the query "freezing point of water". The observation will give me the exact value. Then I can      
retrieve the answer from the wiki result. If the wiki returns 0, then the answer is correct. If not, maybe I need to check another  
source, but for this case, it's a standard fact.                                                                                    
</think>                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                    
Thought: I will use the `wiki` tool to confirm the freezing point of water.

Okay, the user is asking for the freezing point of water in Celsius. From my knowledge, it's 0°C. But since the previous attempt    
tried using a forbidden tool, I need to find another way. Let me think.                                                             
                                                                                                                                    
Since the tools allowed are wiki, web_search, visit_webpage, and others, maybe I can use the wiki tool again but ensure it's        
properly called. Wait, the error said 'wiki' is not among the allowed tools. Oh, maybe the tools list is different. Let me check the
allowed tools again.                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                    
The allowed modules are collections, datetime, itertools, math, queue, random, re, stat, statistics, time, unicodedata. The tools   
are wiki, web_search, visit_webpage. So the wiki tool is allowed. But in the previous code, maybe the function name was wrong. Let  
me make sure the code uses the correct function name.                                                                               
                                                                                                                                    
Wait, the user's code used 'wiki' as a function, but maybe the actual tool is named differently. Let me try again with the correct  
function name. Also, maybe the query needs to be adjusted. Let me try calling the wiki tool with the exact query "freezing point of 
water" again.                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                    
So the code should be:                                                                                                              
freezing_point = wiki(query="freezing point of water")                                                                              
print("Freezing point of water:", freezing_point)                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                    
But since the previous attempt failed, maybe the function is not properly imported. Let me ensure the code is correct.              
Alternatively, maybe the tool is not available, but the user's environment allows it. Since the error was about forbidden function  
evaluation, perhaps the tool is not available. But the user's task is to answer based on known knowledge. Since the freezing point  
of water is a standard fact, the answer is 0°C. So I can directly provide the answer without using any tools.
