Okay, the user is asking who discovered the law of relativity. I need to figure out the answer. Let me think.                       
                                                                                                                                    
First, I remember that Einstein is often credited with the theory of relativity. But wait, the law of relativity here might refer to
Einstein's special relativity or general relativity. However, the term "law of relativity" is a bit ambiguous. Maybe they mean the  
theory as a whole, which was developed by Einstein.                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                    
But I should verify. The law of relativity, as in the theory, was formulated by Albert Einstein. However, there's also the concept  
of the Lorentz law, which is part of special relativity. But the main theory is Einstein's.                                         
                                                                                                                                    
I need to check if there's any other physicist involved. For example, Hendrik Lorentz contributed to the development of the theory, 
but the formal law was Einstein's. So the answer is likely Albert Einstein.                                                         
                                                                                                                                    
But to be sure, I should use the web search tool to confirm. Let me perform a web search for "who discovered the law of relativity" 
to get the most accurate answer.                                                                                                    
</think>

Along the way, there were many missteps. But the theory even more fully revealed Einstein's genius than did his accomplishments of 
1905. Einstein might have gone at the problem by observing that Newton's gravitational force law is almost the same as Coulomb's 
force law for charged particles.

Academy of Sciences in Berlin. The paper presented the final form of what are called the Einstein Equations, the field equations of
