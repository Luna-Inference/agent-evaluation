<think>                                                                                                                             
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Mexico. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have.           
                                                                                                                                    
Hmm, the available tools are web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer. Since the user wants the capital, a web search would be   
straightforward. I can use the web_search function with the query "capital of Mexico".                                              
                                                                                                                                    
Wait, but maybe I should check if there's a specific tool for geographical information. However, the tools provided don't include a 
specific geographical database, so web_search is the best option here.                                                              
                                                                                                                                    
I'll perform a web search for the capital of Mexico. The results should give the answer directly. Once I get the result, I can use  
the final_answer tool to present the answer.                                                                                        
</think>                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                    
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the capital of Mexico.
