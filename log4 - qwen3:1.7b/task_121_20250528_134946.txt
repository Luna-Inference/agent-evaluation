Okay, the user is asking for the main ingredient in pesto. I need to figure out what the answer is. Pesto is a traditional Italian  
sauce made from basil, olive oil, and Parmesan cheese. But maybe there are other ingredients? Let me check.                         
                                                                                                                                    
First, I should confirm the standard ingredients. The main ones are basil, olive oil, and Parmesan cheese. But sometimes people add 
something else like pine nuts. However, the main ingredient is usually considered to be basil. Wait, but maybe the answer expects   
the three primary ingredients. Let me think. The user might want the primary one, which is basil. But I should verify.              
                                                                                                                                    
I can use a web search to check the standard ingredients of pesto. Let me perform a search for "pesto ingredients" to confirm. The  
top results should list the main components. Based on that, the main ingredient is basil. So the answer is basil.

large, fresh basil leaves.You will need around 2 cups of basil, so make sure to get plenty! Parmesan cheese: Adds a salty, savory 
kick.Freshly grated is best. Pine nuts: Classic for pesto, but almonds or walnuts work too.
