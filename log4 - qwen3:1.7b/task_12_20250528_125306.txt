Okay, the user is asking who the first person to walk on the moon was. I need to find that  
information. Let me think about the tools available. The tools mentioned are web_search,    
visit_webpage, and final_answer. Since the question is straightforward, I can use the       
web_search function with the query "first person to walk on the moon".                      
                                                                                            
Wait, the user might expect a specific answer, like Neil Armstrong. But I should verify     
using the web search. Let me check the tools again. The web_search function takes a query   
string and returns the top results. So I'll call web_search with the query "first person to 
walk on the moon" to get the correct information. Then, I can use the final_answer to       
present the result.

Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the answer to the question about the first  
person to walk on the moon.
