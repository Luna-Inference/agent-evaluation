<think>                                                                                                                             
Okay, the user is asking for the currency of the United Kingdom. Let me think about how to approach this.                           
                                                                                                                                    
First, I know that the currency used in the UK is the British Pound, abbreviated as £. But I need to confirm this. Since the user   
might want the exact currency code, like GBP, I should check a reliable source. However, the tools available here are web search and
wiki. Let me use the web_search tool to look up the currency of the UK.                                                             
                                                                                                                                    
I'll perform a web search with the query "UK currency". The result should give the exact answer. Once I get the information, I can  
extract the currency code and present it as the final answer.                                                                       
</think>                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                    
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the currency of the United Kingdom.
