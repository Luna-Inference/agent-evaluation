<think>                                                                                                                             
Okay, the user is asking who invented the light bulb. Let me think about how to approach this.                                      
                                                                                                                                    
First, I need to find the answer. The tools available include web search, which I can use to look up the invention of the light     
bulb. The previous examples show that using the web_search function with a query like "who invented the light bulb" would retrieve  
the necessary information.                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                    
I should check the tools again. The web_search function takes a query string and returns the top results. So I'll use that. The     
answer will be the first result from the search. Then, I can present that answer as the final answer.                               
                                                                                                                                    
Wait, the user might want the exact name of the inventor. Let me make sure the search returns the correct information. The previous 
example used the wiki tool, but here it's a web search. So I'll use web_search with the query "who invented the light bulb".        
                                                                                                                                    
Once I get the result, I can print it and then use final_answer to return the answer. Let me structure the code accordingly.        
</think>
