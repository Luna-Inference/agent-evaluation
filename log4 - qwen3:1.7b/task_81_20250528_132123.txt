<think>                                                                                                                             
Okay, the user is asking for the largest bone in the human body. I need to figure out how to find this information. Let me think    
about the tools available. The previous examples used web searches and tools like wiki and image_qa. Maybe I can use a web search   
here.                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                    
First, I should perform a search to find the largest bone. The bones in the human body include the femur, ulna, radius, humerus,    
tibia, fibula, carpals, metacarpals, phalanges, vertebrae, ribs, scapula, clavicle, etc. The largest one is the femur, but I need to
confirm. Wait, sometimes people confuse the femur with the patella. The patella is a small bone, but the femur is indeed the        
largest.                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                    
But to be sure, I should look up the information. Using the web_search tool with the query "largest bone in human body" would help. 
Then, I can retrieve the result and determine the answer. Once I have the information, I can use the final_answer tool to present   
the answer.                                                                                                                         
</think>                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                    
Thought: I will use the web search tool to find the largest bone in the human body and then return the final answer.
