<think>                                                                                     
Okay, the user is asking for the year World War II ended. I need to find that out. Let me   
think about the tools I have. There's the wiki tool, which can search for information. Maybe
I can use that to look up the end date of WWII.                                             
                                                                                            
Wait, the wiki tool's query would be something like "World War II end date". Let me check   
the rules. I should use the wiki function with the correct parameters. The code would be    
something like pope_age_wiki = wiki(query="World War II end date"). Then, I can print the   
result to get the year.                                                                     
                                                                                            
Alternatively, maybe a web search would be better. But the user's tools include web_search, 
so perhaps using that. But the wiki tool might be more straightforward. Let me try the wiki 
first.                                                                                      
                                                                                            
So the code would be:                                                                       
                                                                                            
pope_age_wiki = wiki(query="World War II end date")                                         
print("Year World War II ended:", pope_age_wiki)                                            
                                                                                            
Then, based on the observation, if the wiki returns the year, I can finalize the answer. If 
not, maybe try the web search. But according to the example, the user might expect the      
answer to be directly retrieved. Let's proceed with the wiki tool first.                    
</think>                                                                                    
                                                                                            
Thought: I will use the `wiki` tool to find the end year of World War II.                   
Code:                                                                                       
```py                                                                                       
world_war_ii_end_year = wiki(query="World War II end date")                                 
final_answer(world_war_ii_end_year)                                                         
```

<think>                                                                                     
Okay, the user is asking for the year World War II ended. The previous attempt tried using  
the `wiki` tool but got an error because the tool wasn't allowed. Now I need to figure out  
another way to get the answer without using the `wiki` function.                            
                                                                                            
Since the `wiki` tool isn't available, maybe I can use a web search instead. The            
`web_search` tool is allowed. So I'll search for "World War II end date" using the web      
search function. Then, I can extract the year from the search results.                      
                                                                                            
Let me check the rules again. The code should use the `web_search` function with the correct
parameters. The query should be "World War II end date". I'll write the code to perform the 
web search and then parse the result to get the year.                                       
                                                                                            
I need to make sure the code is correct and follows the rules. Also, avoid any new variables
that aren't part of the allowed tools. The final answer will be the year extracted from the 
web search results.
