Okay, the user is asking who wrote "The Brothers Karamazov." I need to figure out the answer. From my knowledge, this novel is by   
Fyodor Dostoevsky. But maybe I should verify this using the available tools.                                                        
                                                                                                                                    
Looking at the tools provided, there's a wiki function. I can use that to look up the author. Let me call the wiki function with the
query "The Brothers Karamazov author." The wiki should return the author's name. If the answer is Dostoevsky, then that's the       
answer. If not, maybe there's another possibility, but I think Dostoevsky is the correct author. So I'll proceed with the wiki      
search.
