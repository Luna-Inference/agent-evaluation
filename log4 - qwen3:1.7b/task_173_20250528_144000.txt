Okay, the user is asking who wrote "One Hundred Years of Solitude." Let me think about how to approach this.                        
                                                                                                                                    
First, I need to find the author of that book. Since I can use web search tools, I should perform a search to find the author. The  
tools available include web_search and visit_webpage. Let me use the web_search function with the query "who wrote One Hundred Years
of Solitude."                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                    
I'll call the web_search function with the exact title. The result should give me the author's name. Once I get the answer, I can   
confirm it and present the final answer.
