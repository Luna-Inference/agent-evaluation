Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Egypt. I need to find that information. Let me  
think about the tools I have available. There's the web_search function, which can look up  
information based on a query. Since the question is straightforward, I can use web_search   
with the query "capital of Egypt" to get the answer.                                        
                                                                                            
Wait, the user might want the most recent information. The capital of Egypt is Cairo, but I 
should confirm that. Using the web_search tool with the exact query should return the       
correct answer. Let me write the code to perform the search and then retrieve the result.
