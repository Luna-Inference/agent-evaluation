<think>                                                                                     
Okay, the user is asking about the main gas in the air we breathe. I remember from basic    
science that the air we breathe mainly consists of oxygen. But let me make sure. The        
atmosphere is mostly nitrogen (about 78%) and oxygen (about 21%), with small amounts of     
other gases like argon, carbon dioxide, and trace amounts of others. So the main gas is     
oxygen.                                                                                     
                                                                                            
But maybe I should verify this using a tool. The available tools are web_search and         
visit_webpage. Let me use web_search to check the latest information. The query should be   
"main gas in air we breathe". Let's perform the search and get the top result.

Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the main gas in the air we breathe.         
Code:

main_gas = web_search(query="main gas in air we breathe")

[What Gases Make Up The Air We Breathe? - 
Sciencing](https://www.sciencing.com/gases-make-up-air-breath-8450810/)
Oxygen: Life-Giving Gas. Making up almost 21 percent of the air all living things breathe, 
oxygen is absorbed by the lungs, or lung-like structures in lower animals, and transported 
to all cells in the body by the blood. Oxygen is the most unstable, and therefore the most 
chemically active, gas found in air.

[Composition of Inhaled and Exhaled Air - 
BYJU'S](https://byjus.com/biology/composition-gases-breathe/)
Composition of Inhaled and Exhaled Air Gases we Breathe In. We all are aware that our 
atmosphere is a mixture of gases and it contains 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 1% argon, 0.04% 
carbon dioxide, 0.5% water vapour. When we breathe in, we inhale the same mixture of gases 
contained in the atmosphere as our nose cannot filter out the oxygen from ...

[The Chemical Composition of Air - 
ThoughtCo](https://www.thoughtco.com/chemical-composition-of-air-604288)
The 1-5% range places water vapor as the third most common gas (which alters the other 
percentages accordingly). Water content varies according to air temperature. Dry air is 
denser than humid air. However, sometimes humid air contains actual water droplets, which 
can make it more dense than humid air that only contains water vapor.

[Gasses We Breathe In and Breathe Out | Composition of 
Air](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/gasses-composition-of-air/)
The gases we breathe in and breathe out do not only include oxygen and carbon dioxide 
respectively rather they include many more gases that compose the air. When we breathe, the 
air inhaled contains around 79% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 0.03% carbon dioxide, and other gases.
However, only oxygen is absorbed by the blood and taken to the body parts.

[What Gases Do We Breathe in and Out? - 
Reference.com](https://www.reference.com/science-technology/gases-breathe-out-3af5be5af74ddc
0d)
The gases that humans breathe out are the same, although more carbon dioxide and less oxygen
is present. Earth's atmosphere at sea level is approximately 78 percent nitrogen gas by 
volume. The second most common gas is oxygen, which makes up 20 to 21 percent of the 
atmosphere by volume.

[The Atmosphere | National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration](https://www.noaa.gov/jetstream/atmosphere)
The atmosphere surrounds the Earth and holds the air we breathe; it protects us from outer 
space; and holds moisture (clouds), gases, and tiny particles. In short, the atmosphere is 
the protective bubble in which we live. This protective bubble consists of several gases 
(listed in the table below), with the top four making up 99.998% of all gases.

[What Are the Gases in the Air? - The Environmental Literacy 
Council](https://enviroliteracy.org/what-are-the-gases-in-the-air/)
The air we breathe is a complex mixture of various gases, each playing a critical role in 
shaping the Earth's climate and sustaining life. From the abundant nitrogen and oxygen to 
the trace amounts of greenhouse gases and other compounds, understanding the composition of 
the atmosphere is essential for tackling the challenges of climate ...

A Sea of Gas . We live and breathe in the atmosphere, a sea of gas consisting primarily of 
elemental O 2 and N 2.The fundamental properties of gases determine the properties of the 
atmosphere. Recall that gases consist of molecules or atoms (in the case of noble gases) 
with large amounts of space between them.

[The Air We Breathe - Smithsonian 
Institution](https://forces.si.edu/atmosphere/02_01_02.html)
The Air We Breathe. Molecules in the air include primarily nitrogen and oxygen as well as 
water, carbon dioxide, ozone, and many other compounds in trace amounts, some created 
naturally, others the result of human activity. In addition to gases, the atmosphere 
contains extras such as smoke, dust, acid droplets, and pollen.

[What are the main gases in the air we 
breathe?](https://teacherscollegesj.org/what-are-the-main-gases-in-the-air-we-breathe/)
What is the most common gas in the air we breathe? The most common gas people breathe from 
clean air is nitrogen. Air is a mixture of gases, and the air on Earth contains about 78 
percent nitrogen and about 21 percent oxygen. Argon , carbon dioxide neon, helium, methane, 
krypton, hydrogen and xenon are in much smaller amounts.
