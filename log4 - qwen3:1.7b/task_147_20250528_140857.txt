<think>                                                                                                                             
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of the Czech Republic. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have
available.                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                    
The available tools are web_search and visit_webpage. Maybe I can use web_search with the query "capital of Czech Republic".        
Alternatively, I can use visit_webpage to a specific website that lists capitals. But since the user didn't specify a particular    
source, web_search seems more straightforward.                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                    
I should call web_search with the query "capital of Czech Republic" to get the top results. Then, from the results, I can extract   
the capital. The answer will be the first result's content. Let me write the code for that.                                         
</think>                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                    
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the capital of the Czech Republic.
