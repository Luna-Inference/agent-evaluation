Okay, the user is asking for the chemical symbol of sodium. I need to figure out what that is. From what I remember, sodium is a    
metal found in group 1 of the periodic table. Its symbol is Na. But wait, maybe I should verify this to be sure. Let me check if    
there's any possibility of a different symbol. For example, sometimes elements have different symbols based on their isotopes, but  
sodium's standard symbol is definitely Na. I don't think there's a different symbol for sodium. So the answer should be Na. But to  
be thorough, maybe I should use a tool to confirm. However, the available tools are web_search and visit_webpage. Let me use        
web_search with the query "chemical symbol for sodium" to get the accurate information.

Thought: I will use the web search tool to confirm the chemical symbol for sodium.
