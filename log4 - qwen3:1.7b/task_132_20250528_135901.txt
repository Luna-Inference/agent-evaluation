<think>                                                                                                                             
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Austria. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have.          
                                                                                                                                    
First, I can use the web search tool to look up the capital of Austria. The web_search function would be appropriate here. The query
should be "capital of Austria". Let me check if there's any need for translation or additional steps. The user didn't specify any   
particular language, so just a straightforward search.                                                                              
                                                                                                                                    
I'll call the web_search function with the query. Then, I'll process the result to extract the capital. If the search returns the   
information, I can directly answer the question. If not, maybe I need to try another approach, but given the tools available,       
web_search should work.                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                    
So the code would be something like:                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                    
pope_age_wiki = wiki(query="current pope age")                                                                                      
print("Pope age as per wikipedia:", pope_age_wiki)                                                                                  
pope_age_search = web_search(query="current pope age")                                                                              
print("Pope age as per google search:", pope_age_search)                                                                            
                                                                                                                                    
Wait, but the user's question is about the capital of Austria, not the pope's age. So I should adjust the query to "capital of      
Austria". Let me correct that.                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                    
So the code should be:                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                    
capital = web_search(query="capital of Austria")                                                                                    
final_answer(capital)                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                    
I need to make sure that the web_search returns the correct capital. If the search result is straightforward, like "Vienna", then   
the answer is Vienn. If there's any uncertainty, maybe check another source, but given the tools, this should suffice.
