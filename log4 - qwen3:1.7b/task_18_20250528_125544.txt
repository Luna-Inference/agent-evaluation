<think>                                                                                     
Okay, the user is asking who discovered penicillin. I need to find the answer using the     
tools available. Let me think about the tools I have. There's the wiki tool, which can be   
used to look up information. Also, there's a web search tool that can retrieve current      
information.                                                                                
                                                                                            
First, I should use the wiki tool to get the age of the pope, but that's not relevant here. 
Wait, the task is about penicillin. So I should use the wiki tool with the query "discovered
penicillin". Let me check if that's possible.                                               
                                                                                            
Alternatively, the web_search tool could be used with the query "who discovered penicillin".
But the user's previous examples used the wiki tool, so maybe that's the way to go. Let me  
try the wiki first.                                                                         
                                                                                            
So the code would be something like: pope_age_wiki = wiki(query="discovered penicillin").   
Then print the result. But I need to make sure the query is correct. The correct answer is  
Alexander Fleming, but I should verify using the tools.                                     
                                                                                            
Wait, the tools are notional, so I can assume that the wiki tool will return the correct    
information. Let me proceed with that. The code would be:                                   
                                                                                            
pope_age_wiki = wiki(query="discovered penicillin")                                         
print("Pope age as per wikipedia:", pope_age_wiki)                                          
                                                                                            
But the user's previous examples used the wiki tool for different queries. So this should   
work. Then, based on the output, I can provide the answer. If the wiki returns the correct  
information, then the answer is Alexander Fleming. Otherwise, maybe the web search would be 
better. But since the user's tools include both, I'll go with the wiki first.               
</think>                                                                                    
                                                                                            
Thought: I will use the wiki tool to find the answer about who discovered penicillin.       
Code:

Okay, the user is asking who discovered penicillin. The previous attempt tried using the    
'wiki' tool but got an error because that tool wasn't allowed. Now I need to figure out     
another way to get the answer without using the 'wiki' function.                            
                                                                                            
Since the 'wiki' tool isn't available, I'll have to use the web search tool instead. The web
search tool can look up information about penicillin discovery. Let me adjust the code to   
use web_search with the query "who discovered penicillin".                                  
                                                                                            
I'll structure the code to perform a web search for the answer. The code will retrieve the  
search results and then extract the information. Since the web search tool returns the top  
results, I'll check the first result to find the answer.                                    
                                                                                            
Here's the plan: use the web_search function with the query "who discovered penicillin",    
then parse the first result to get the discoverer's name. Finally, use the final_answer tool
to present the answer.

Okay, so the user asked who discovered penicillin. The initial attempt used the wiki tool,  
but it wasn't allowed. Then I tried the web search tool, which returned results. The        
observation shows that the web search retrieved multiple sources, including Wikipedia and   
other articles.                                                                             
                                                                                            
Looking at the search results, the common answer is Alexander Fleming. The first result from
the web search mentions he discovered penicillin in 1928, and the subsequent links confirm  
his role. The answer is straightforward: Alexander Fleming.                                 
                                                                                            
Since the tools are restricted, I can't use the wiki function again. The web search provided
sufficient information. The final answer should be Alexander Fleming based on the search    
results.
