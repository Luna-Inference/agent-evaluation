Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Germany. I need to find that out. Let me think about the tools I have.                  
                                                                                                                                    
First, I remember that the tool 'wiki' can be used to look up information. So I'll use the wiki tool with the query "capital of     
Germany". That should give me the answer. Let me check if there are any other tools, but the available ones are web search and      
visit_webpage. But since the user is asking for a straightforward answer, the wiki tool should suffice. I'll call the wiki function 
with the correct query.                                                                                                             
</think>

Okay, the previous attempt failed because the 'wiki' tool wasn't allowed. Let me think of another way to get the capital of Germany.
Since the user is asking for a straightforward answer, maybe I can use a web search directly. The web_search tool can be used here. 
Let me try that.                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                    
I'll use the web_search function with the query "capital of Germany" to get the top result. Then I can extract the capital from the 
search results. Let me check the parameters again to make sure I use the correct tool. The web_search function takes a query string,
so I'll set query="capital of Germany". Then, I'll parse the search results to find the capital. Since the observation might return 
multiple entries, I'll pick the first one. Finally, I'll use the final_answer tool to present the result.
