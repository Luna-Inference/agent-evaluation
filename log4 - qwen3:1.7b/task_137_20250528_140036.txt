Okay, the user is asking who wrote 'The Iliad'. I need to figure out how to find this information. Let's think about the tools      
available. The user mentioned using web search and visiting webpages, so maybe I can use the web_search function.                   
                                                                                                                                    
First, I should perform a web search for the title 'The Iliad' to find the author. The search results might mention the author.     
Then, I can check the top results to confirm. Once I have the author's name, I can present it as the final answer.                  
                                                                                                                                    
I should make sure to use the correct parameters for the web_search function. The query should be "The Iliad author" or similar. Let
me structure the code to do a web search and then extract the author from the results.                                              
</think>
