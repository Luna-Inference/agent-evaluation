<think>                                                                                                                             
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Switzerland. I need to find that out. Let me think about the tools I have.              
                                                                                                                                    
Hmm, the available tools are web search, visiting webpages, and final answer. So maybe I can use the web search tool to look up the 
capital of Switzerland. The query would be "capital of Switzerland". Let me check if there's a direct way to get this information.  
                                                                                                                                    
Wait, the user might expect a straightforward answer. But since I can't browse the internet directly, I need to use the web_search  
function. Let me structure the code. The code should perform a web search for the capital of Switzerland and then retrieve the      
result. Then, I can use the final_answer tool to present the answer.                                                                
                                                                                                                                    
So the steps are: call web_search with the query "capital of Switzerland", get the result, and then print or store it in a variable.
Then, use final_answer to output the result. Let me write the code accordingly.

Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the capital of Switzerland.
