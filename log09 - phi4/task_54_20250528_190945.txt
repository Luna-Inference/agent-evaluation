Thought: To identify a famous composer from the Classical period, I will use the `wiki` tool to gather information about composers and their          
associated periods in music history. This should help me find a well-known name.

Thought: It seems I attempted to use an undefined tool `wiki`. Since I do not have direct access to tools like `wiki`, I'll instead perform a web     
search for composers from the Classical period using the `web_search` function. This should help me find information about notable composers from that
era.
