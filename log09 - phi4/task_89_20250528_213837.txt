To answer this question, I need to find the scientific term for the process by which water changes from a liquid state to a gaseous state. This can be
done using an external search.

Sirintra Pumsopa / Getty Images This photo displays the process of condensation of water vapor into dew drops. Condensation, the opposite of 
evaporation, is the phase change of matter from gas into liquid.

[Evaporation - National Geographic Society](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/evaporation/)
Evaporation is the process by which a liquid turns into a gas. It is also one of the three main steps in the global water cycle.

[How does water turn to gas? - Geographic Pedia - NCESC](https://www.ncesc.com/geographic-pedia/how-does-water-turn-to-gas/)
The process by which water vapor changes from a gas to a liquid is called condensation. It occurs when water vapor cools down, losing energy and 
slowing down the movement of its molecules.

[Evaporation and the Water Cycle | U.S. Geological 
Survey](https://www.usgs.gov/special-topics/water-science-school/science/evaporation-and-water-cycle)
Evaporation is the process that changes liquid water to gaseous water (water vapor). Water moves from the Earth's surface to the atmosphere via 
evaporation.

[States of Water: Gas, Liquid and Solid - Earth How](https://earthhow.com/states-of-water/)
Because water is extremely versatile, it changes phases rapidly. The states of water are gas, liquid and solid. Water cycles through these phases in 
nature.

In its gas state, water is invisible, can flow, has no fixed volume and takes the shape of the whole of its container. The process in which a liquid 
changes to a gas is called evaporation. Water can be observed changing from liquid to gas. We can change the state of a liquid to a gas by heating.

gas?](https://www.wyzant.com/resources/answers/948983/what-is-the-name-of-the-process-that-changes-water-from-a-liquid-to-a-gas)
The process that changes water from a liquid to a gas is called evaporation. When water is heated, its molecules gain energy and move faster, 
eventually breaking free from the liquid state and entering the gaseous state as water vapor. This process can occur at any temperature, but it 
happens more quickly at higher temperatures. If the process occurs at boiling point, it is referred to as boiling.

LibreTexts](https://geo.libretexts.org/Courses/Fullerton_College/Introduction_to_Earth_Science_(Ikeda)/11:_Water/11.01:_Water_Cycle)
The water cycle is the continuous circulation of water in the Earth's atmosphere. During circulation, water changes between solid, liquid, and gas 
(water vapor) and changes location. The processes involved in the water cycle are evaporation, transpiration, condensation, precipitation, and runoff.

[Evaporation: the conversion of water from a liquid into a gas](http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/(Gh)/guides/mtr/hyd/evap.rxml)
Water is transferred from the surface to the atmosphere through evaporation, the process by which water changes from a liquid to a gas. Approximately 
80% of all evaporation is from the oceans, with the remaining 20% coming from inland water and vegetation.

Based on the web search results, the process by which water changes from liquid to gas is known as **evaporation**. Evaporation occurs when water     
molecules gain enough energy to break free from their liquid state and enter the gaseous state as water vapor. This process can happen at any         
temperature but occurs more rapidly at higher temperatures.
