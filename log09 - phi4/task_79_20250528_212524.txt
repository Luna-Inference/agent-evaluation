Thought: The web search results indicate that multiple inventors contributed to the development of the light bulb. Key figures include Humphry Davy,  
who created an early electric lamp in 1809, and Thomas Edison, who developed a practical incandescent bulb using a carbon filament in 1879. Others    
like Joseph Swan also made significant contributions around the same time. This suggests that while Edison is often credited with inventing the light 
bulb, it was actually the result of cumulative efforts by various inventors.
