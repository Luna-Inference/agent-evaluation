Based on the web search results, the speed of light is a well-established universal constant, denoted as \( c \). It is exactly equal to 299,792,458 meters  
per second in a vacuum. This value is exact because the meter was defined based on this constant speed. The importance of the speed of light extends beyond  
its role in electromagnetic waves; it is fundamental in physics and cosmology.                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                             
The results from various authoritative sources like Wikipedia, Britannica, and scientific websites consistently affirm this value. Additionally, they explain
that while the speed of light in a vacuum is constant, it can slow down when traveling through different media such as glass or water due to interactions at 
the atomic level.                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                             
Thus, the recognized speed of light in a vacuum remains \( 299,792,458 \) meters per second, which is approximately \( 300,000 \) kilometers per second. This
constant plays a crucial role in defining units of length and understanding the nature of space-time as described by theories like special relativity.       
                                                                                                                                                             
Final answer: The speed of light in a vacuum is exactly 299,792,458 meters per second.
