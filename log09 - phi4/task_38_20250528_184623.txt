From the search results obtained using the `web_search` tool, it is evident that Michelangelo painted the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel between 1508  
and 1512. The project was commissioned by Pope Julius II, as mentioned in several reputable sources including Wikipedia, Britannica, and other        
historical resources. Michelangelo, primarily known for his work as a sculptor, undertook this monumental task of painting frescoes that depict scenes
from the Old Testament.                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                      
With this information confirmed across multiple references, I can confidently state that Michelangelo was the artist who painted the ceiling of the   
Sistine Chapel.
