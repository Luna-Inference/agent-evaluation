Superhard materials are measured on a scale that is known as the Vickers Hardness Test. The unit that expresses what kind of pressure an item can take
before it breaks is called gigapascals (GPa). For example, the strongest naturally occurring material we know are diamonds, and they score between 70 
and 150 GPa.

Thought: Based on the search results, diamond is consistently mentioned as the hardest known natural material with a Vickers hardness in the range of 
70-150 GPa. It is also noted that while there are materials harder than diamonds, such as certain alloys and carbon-based materials like lonsdaleite  
and buckypaper, they may not be naturally occurring or abundant. Therefore, diamond remains the hardest known natural material.
