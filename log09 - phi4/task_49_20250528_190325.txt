Thought: The web search results have provided several reliable sources on cloud types. From these resources, I can identify three common types of     
clouds.                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                      
1. **Cumulus**: These are fluffy, white clouds with a flat base that often appear during fair weather. They usually form at low to middle altitudes.  
2. **Cirrus**: These are thin, wispy clouds found at high altitudes. Composed of ice crystals, they typically indicate fair weather but can also      
signal an approaching change in the weather.                                                                                                          
3. **Stratus**: These are uniform grayish clouds that often cover the entire sky like a blanket, leading to overcast conditions. They usually form at 
low altitudes and can bring light rain or drizzle.
