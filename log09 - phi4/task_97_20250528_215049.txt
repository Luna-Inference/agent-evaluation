Based on the search results, it is evident that giraffes are consistently mentioned as the tallest animals in the world. The information suggests that
male giraffes can reach heights of up to 6 meters (approximately 20 feet), while female giraffes may grow up to about 5.2 meters (around 17 feet).    
This height makes giraffes the tallest terrestrial animals, both for males and females.
