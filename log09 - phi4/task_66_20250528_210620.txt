To find out which element is the most abundant in the universe, I'll perform a web search. This will help me gather information from reliable sources 
about the composition of the universe.                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: First, I need to use the `web_search` function to look up the most abundant element in the universe.

Similarly, hydrogen makes up 0.75 wt% of Earth's crust; but of course, it is a much larger component of its surface, mostly because of the abundance 
of water.

The observations from the web search indicate that hydrogen is consistently mentioned as the most abundant element in the universe across various     
reliable sources.                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                      
To summarize:                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                      
- Hydrogen constitutes approximately 75% of the universe's mass and is followed by helium, making up about 24%. This information was found on multiple
websites including a Wikipedia page on chemical element abundance and a Science Notes article.                                                        
                                                                                                                                                      
- Oxygen ranks as the third most abundant element in the universe. Sources like Astronoo and Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics confirm this 
ranking.                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
The consistent mention of hydrogen as the predominant element by numerous sources supports its status as the most abundant element in the universe.   
Based on these findings, I will provide a final answer.
