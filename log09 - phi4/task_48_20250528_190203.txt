Thought: The web search results indicate that while diamond is the most well-known and commonly referred to as the hardest natural substance, there   
are other materials like lonsdaleite and wurtzite boron nitride (w-BN) that may be even harder. To provide a conclusive answer, it's important to     
consider both common knowledge and scientific findings.
