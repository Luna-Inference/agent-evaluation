Thought: From the search results, it's evident that the process of cell division is commonly referred to as "mitosis" in eukaryotic cells for general 
cellular replication, along with another type called "meiosis," which specifically relates to the formation of gametes. To provide a concise answer, I
will identify the main processes mentioned.
