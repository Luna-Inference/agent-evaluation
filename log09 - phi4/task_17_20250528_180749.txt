Based on the information gathered from the web search:                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                             
1. **Mount Everest** is widely recognized as the tallest mountain in the world when measured by its height above sea level. It reaches an elevation of 29,032
feet (8,849 meters), making it the highest point above sea level.                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                             
2. However, if we consider measurements that take into account the Earth's curvature and how far a peak is from the center of the Earth, **Mauna Kea** in    
Hawaii is often noted for being the tallest mountain when measured from its base on the ocean floor, reaching about 10,203 meters (33,474 feet) from sea     
floor to summit.                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                             
3. Similarly, **Chimborazo** in Ecuador is recognized as the farthest point from the Earth's center due to the equatorial bulge, even though it's not the    
highest by elevation above sea level.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                             
For clarity regarding which mountain is considered "the tallest" can depend on how you define height:                                                        
                                                                                                                                                             
- By peak height above sea level: **Mount Everest**.                                                                                                         
- By total rise from base (including underwater): **Mauna Kea**.                                                                                             
- By distance from Earth's center: **Chimborazo**.                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                             
Given the context of common usage and standard measurements, Mount Everest is usually referred to as the tallest mountain in the world when considering      
height above sea level.
