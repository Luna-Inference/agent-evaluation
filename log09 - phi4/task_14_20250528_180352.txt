...](https://scienceexchange.caltech.edu/topics/quantum-science-explained/entanglement)
Entanglement is at the heart of quantum physics and future quantum technologies. Like other aspects of quantum science, the phenomenon of entanglement 
reveals itself at very tiny, subatomic scales. When two particles, such as a pair of photons or electrons, become entangled, they remain connected even when 
separated by vast distances.

consider a simple non-quantum (or ...

[What is Quantum Entanglement? NASA Science](https://science.nasa.gov/what-is-the-spooky-science-of-quantum-entanglement/)
In 1935, Albert Einstein and colleagues first pointed out the "spooky" action of quantum entanglement. Quantum entanglement, however, appeared to conflict 
with Einstein's theory of special relativity, which postulates that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light and is demonstrated mathematically by 
the well-known equation E=mc2.

This video is hosted by Associate Professor Andrea Morello from the School of Engineering (University of New South Wales, Australia), who is able to give a 
very clear explanation of quantum entanglement. Morello shows that the best way to explain it is to first explore what it's not: classical correlation. And 
this can be done using a simple piece of paper and red and blue text.

[Quantum entanglement - Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement)
Quantum entanglement is the name given to a special connection between pairs or groups of quantum systems, or any objects described by quantum mechanics. 
Quantum entanglement is one of the biggest parts of quantum mechanics that makes it hard to understand in terms of the everyday world.

[Quantum entanglement - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement)
Quantum entanglement is the phenomenon where the quantum state of each particle in a group cannot be described independently of the state of the others, even
when the particles are separated by a large distance. The topic of quantum entanglement is at the heart of the disparity between classical physics and 
quantum physics: entanglement is a primary feature of quantum mechanics not present in ...

Thought: The search results provide several references for understanding quantum entanglement in simple terms. I'll focus on extracting key ideas to create  
an easy-to-understand explanation.

Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where two or more particles become linked and instantaneously affect each other, no matter how far apart they are.      
Here's a simplified breakdown:                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                             
1. **Connection at a Distance**: Once entangled, the state of one particle instantly influences the state of another, even if separated by large distances.  
                                                                                                                                                             
2. **Non-classical Correlation**: Unlike everyday objects that can be described independently, entangled particles cannot be fully described without         
considering each other.                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                             
3. **Spooky Action**: Albert Einstein famously referred to it as "spooky action at a distance," because it defies classical physics' expectations about how  
information should travel.                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                             
4. **Applications**: Quantum entanglement is crucial for emerging technologies like quantum computing and secure communication through quantum cryptography. 
                                                                                                                                                             
5. **Core of Quantum Mechanics**: It highlights the difference between the predictable world of classical physics and the probabilistic nature of quantum    
mechanics.

Execution logs:

Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where two or more particles become linked and instantaneously affect each other, no matter how far apart they are. 
Here's a simplified breakdown:

1. **Connection at a Distance**: Once entangled, the state of one particle instantly influences the state of another, even if separated by large distances.
   
2. **Non-classical Correlation**: Unlike everyday objects that can be described independently, entangled particles cannot be fully described without 
considering each other.

3. **Spooky Action**: Albert Einstein famously referred to it as "spooky action at a distance," because it defies classical physics' expectations about how 
information should travel.

4. **Applications**: Quantum entanglement is crucial for emerging technologies like quantum computing and secure communication through quantum cryptography.

5. **Core of Quantum Mechanics**: It highlights the difference between the predictable world of classical physics and the probabilistic nature of quantum 
mechanics.
