To determine the longest river in the world, I'll first perform a web search using the available tools. This will help me gather information about the
rivers and their lengths.

Based on the search results, there is a general consensus that the Nile River is considered the longest river in the world, with its length being     
approximately 6,695 kilometers. However, it's important to note that there are differing opinions regarding the Amazon River potentially having a     
longer length under certain measurements and definitions.                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                      
Given this information from multiple sources:                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                      
1. **Wikipedia** mentions both the Nile and Amazon as contenders for the longest river due to varying measurement techniques.                         
2. **Guinness World Records** officially lists the Nile as the longest at 6,695 kilometers, while some estimates place the Amazon slightly longer at  
approximately 6,750 kilometers.                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                      
Considering these perspectives, while the Nile is traditionally recognized as the longest based on widely accepted measurements and historical        
records, discussions around the Amazon's length suggest it could surpass the Nile under different criteria. Therefore, for most conventional purposes,
we can conclude that:                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
**Final Answer:** The Nile River is considered the longest river in the world with a length of approximately 6,695 kilometers.
