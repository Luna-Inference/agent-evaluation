Based on the search results observed, several sources consistently mention that the Burj Khalifa is the tallest building in the world. It's located in
Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and stands at a height of 828 meters (2,717 feet).                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                      
The Merdeka 118 in Malaysia was recently completed in 2023 and is noted as one of the tallest buildings globally, but it doesn't surpass the Burj     
Khalifa.                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
To provide a final answer:
