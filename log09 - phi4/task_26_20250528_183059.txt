Based on the search results I retrieved, here is a comprehensive definition of "photosynthesis":                                                             
                                                                                                                                                             
Photosynthesis is the biological process by which green plants, algae, and certain bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy. This process involves 
capturing light energy to transform water (H₂O) and carbon dioxide (CO₂) from the environment into oxygen (O₂) and glucose, an energy-rich organic compound. 
Photosynthesis consists of two main stages: the light-dependent reactions, where solar energy is converted into chemical energy stored in ATP and NADPH; and 
the Calvin cycle or light-independent reactions, where CO₂ is fixed into glucose using the energy from ATP and NADPH. This process not only sustains the     
organisms that perform it but also supports most life on Earth by producing oxygen as a byproduct and forming the base of food chains.
