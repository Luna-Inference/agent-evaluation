To find out who the Greek god of the sea is, I can use a web search to get the relevant information. Here's my plan:                                  
                                                                                                                                                      
1. Use the `web_search` tool to look up "Greek god of the sea."                                                                                       
2. Analyze the results to identify the correct answer.                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                      
Let's proceed with the search.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will perform a web search using the query "Greek god of the sea" to find out who this deity is.

Based on the web search results I retrieved, it appears that Poseidon is consistently identified as the Greek god of the sea across multiple sources. 
Here's a summary of my findings:
