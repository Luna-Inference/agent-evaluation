To determine the largest ocean on Earth, I need to gather information about the sizes of the world's oceans. Here's my plan:                          
                                                                                                                                                      
1. Use the `web_search` tool to search for information regarding the size of the world's oceans.                                                      
2. Identify which ocean is the largest based on the search results.                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                      
Let's start by performing a web search for "largest ocean in the world."                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the `web_search` tool to find out which is the largest ocean.

From the web search results, it's clear that multiple sources consistently identify the **Pacific Ocean** as the largest ocean in the world. The      
Pacific Ocean covers approximately 63 million square miles (over 165 million square kilometers), which is more than half of the Earth's free water    
surface area.                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                      
Here are some key points from the observed data:                                                                                                      
- The Pacific Ocean spans around 63 million square miles.                                                                                             
- It contains more than half of the Earth's free water, making it significantly larger than any other ocean.                                          
- Other oceans like the Atlantic and Indian Oceans follow in size but do not come close to the vastness of the Pacific.                               
                                                                                                                                                      
Based on this consistent information across multiple sources, I conclude that:
