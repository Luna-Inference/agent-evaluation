<think>                                                                                                                    
Okay, the user is asking for the current distance from Earth to the Moon. I need to find that value. Let me think about the
tools available.                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                           
First, I remember that there are tools like web search and maybe a wiki. The user might expect a straightforward answer,   
but since the tools are limited, I need to use the available functions.                                                    
                                                                                                                           
The tools provided are web_search and final_answer. So I should use web_search to look up the distance. The query should be
something like "distance from Earth to the Moon".                                                                          
                                                                                                                           
Wait, the user might want the latest data. The answer might vary slightly based on the measurement method. But I need to   
get the most recent value. Let me perform the search.                                                                      
                                                                                                                           
I'll call web_search with the query "distance from Earth to the Moon". Then, the result will give me the distance. Once I  
have the value, I can use final_answer to present it.                                                                      
</think>                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                           
Thought: I will use the `web_search` tool to find the current distance from Earth to the Moon.

[Lunar distance - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_distance)
The instantaneous Earth-Moon distance, or distance to the Moon, is the distance from the center of Earth to the center of 
the Moon.In contrast, the Lunar distance (LD or ), or Earth-Moon characteristic distance, is a unit of measure in 
astronomy.More technically, it is the semi-major axis of the geocentric lunar orbit.The average lunar distance is 
approximately 385,000 km (239,000 mi), or ...

The average distance between the Earth and the Moon is 384 400 km (238 855 miles). The Moon's elliptical orbit with the 
distances at apogee and perigee. Note that the Earth is not at the very centre of the orbit and that the eccentricity of 
the orbit has been exaggerated here!

[Distance to the Moon - The Miles to the Moon from Earth - Planet Facts](https://planetfacts.org/distance-to-the-moon/)
The Moon is not always at a constant distance from the Earth. At times the Moon comes closer to Earth and at times it is 
further away. The closest position of the Moon is called lunar perigee and the distance at that time is calculated to be 
356,700 km (221,643 mi). When the Moon is away from Earth, it is called apogee. At apogee, the distance ... kilometers.
