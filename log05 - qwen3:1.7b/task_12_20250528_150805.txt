Okay, the user is asking who the first person to walk on the moon was. I need to find that information. Let me think about 
the tools I have. The available tools are web search, visiting web pages, and final answer.                                
                                                                                                                           
First, I should perform a web search to find the answer. The query should be "first person to walk on the moon". I'll use  
the web_search function with that query. Then, I'll check the results to get the correct information.                      
                                                                                                                           
Wait, the user might expect the answer to be Neil Armstrong. But I need to make sure. Let me execute the search. If the    
search returns the correct result, I can then use the final_answer tool to present the answer.
