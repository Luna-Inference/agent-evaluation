<think>                                                                                                                    
Okay, the user is asking for the capital city of Japan. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I    
have.                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                           
The available tools are web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer. Since the user wants the capital city, a web search   
would be the best approach. I can use the web_search function with the query "capital city of Japan".                      
                                                                                                                           
Wait, but maybe I should check if there's a specific tool for geographical information. However, the tools provided don't  
include a specific geography-related tool. So, the best way is to perform a web search and retrieve the top result.        
                                                                                                                           
I'll write a code snippet that uses web_search with the query "capital city of Japan". Then, I'll extract the answer from  
the results and return it using final_answer.                                                                              
</think>                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                           
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the capital city of Japan.                                                 
Code:
