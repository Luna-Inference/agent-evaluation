**Thought:** This task requires a multifaceted approach to manage a complex crisis situation. I need to consider the various stakeholders involved, including
customers, employees, executives, and regulatory bodies.                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                             
To address this challenge, I will use the following tools:

* `stakeholder_analysis` to identify key stakeholders and their interests                                                                                    
* `communication_strategies` to develop effective communication plans for various stakeholder groups                                                         
* `risk_assessment` to evaluate potential legal liabilities and mitigate them if possible

**Thought:** Since the `crisis_management` tool is not available for import, I need to find an alternative approach to manage the crisis. Instead of using a 
specialized crisis management tool, I can use general problem-solving strategies and tools that are available.                                               
                                                                                                                                                             
One possible approach is to break down the crisis into smaller, manageable tasks and address each one systematically. This will help me stay focused on      
finding solutions rather than getting overwhelmed by the complexity of the situation.

**Thought:** It seems that the generated solutions are not very useful, and I need to try a different approach. Instead of using itertools to generate       
combinations of actions, I can use a more structured approach.                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                             
I can create a template for each stakeholder group with a list of potential actions that can be taken to address their concerns. Then, I can iterate over    
each template and add the corresponding action to a central solution string.

**Thought:** The central solution string is printed out, but it's not very comprehensive. I need to consider other factors that might impact the crisis, such
as potential consequences of not addressing the issue, or alternative solutions that might be more effective.                                                
                                                                                                                                                             
One possible approach is to use a decision tree to evaluate the different paths and choose the most optimal solution. This would require using a library like
`scipy` to implement the decision tree algorithm.

**Thought:** Since I'm unable to use NumPy and Scipy due to the import restrictions, I'll need to find an alternative approach to solve this problem. In this
case, I can create a simple decision tree-like system using if-else statements.                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                             
Here's a new code snippet that should work within the authorized imports:

**Thought:** The current decision tree-like system seems to be biased towards not taking any action, which might not be the most optimal solution. I need to 
re-evaluate the stakeholders and their templates to find a more balanced approach.

It seems that the previous approach is not producing a meaningful result. Let's try to rethink the problem and come up with a new solution.                  
                                                                                                                                                             
Upon re-examining the problem, I realize that the task is to determine the optimal course of action for managing a customer service crisis involving product 
defects, safety concerns, and potential legal liability. The goal is to provide a solution that balances the needs of all stakeholders involved.             
                                                                                                                                                             
After considering different approaches, I propose a new solution that takes into account the following factors:                                              
                                                                                                                                                             
1. Customer satisfaction: Providing a full refund for affected customers is essential to maintain customer trust and loyalty.                                
2. Employee well-being: Offering additional training on safety procedures can help prevent similar incidents in the future and ensure employee safety.       
3. Legal liability: Conducting an internal review to determine cause and prevent similar incidents in the future can help minimize potential legal           
liabilities.

1. Provide a full refund for affected customers.                                                                                                             
2. Offer additional training on safety procedures for employees.                                                                                             
3. Conduct an internal review to determine cause and prevent similar incidents in the future.
