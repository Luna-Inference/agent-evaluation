Thought: To approach this problem, I will think about various scenarios where a restaurant could have an empty interior while having a long line outside.    
Here are three possible explanations:                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                             
1. The restaurant might be preparing for a large catering event or private function that will require many staff members and resources, leaving the main     
dining area empty.                                                                                                                                           
2. It's possible that the restaurant is closed for renovations or maintenance, but the line outside suggests that it's still operating normally.             
3. Another possibility is that the restaurant has changed its seating policy or layout, requiring customers to wait in a designated area outside before being
seated.
