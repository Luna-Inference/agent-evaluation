Thought: The pharmaceutical company's decision to price its life-saving drug highly can be seen as unethical, especially when considering the immense value  
this medication brings to patients' lives. One major concern here is affordability - many individuals and families cannot afford the high cost of the drug,  
which may lead them to not take it, potentially resulting in their own deaths or severe health issues.                                                       
                                                                                                                                                             
Another significant issue is fairness - who gets access to this life-saving drug first? Should it be limited to those with means, or should efforts be made  
to lower the price for everyone? And how will this impact patients' ability to obtain necessary treatment?                                                   
                                                                                                                                                             
Lastly, there's an element of profit vs. public good. The company may prioritize making a higher return on investment over using their resources to find     
cheaper alternatives or working out deals that make the drug more accessible.
