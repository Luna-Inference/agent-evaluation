Thought: To say "thank you" in Italian, I need to use a tool that can translate languages. Since English and Italian are both supported by the `translator`  
tool, I will use it to get the translation.

Thought: Since I couldn't use the `translator` tool as expected, I'll try a different approach. Instead of translating the phrase "How do you say thank you  
in Italian?" directly, I can simply look up the translation for "thank you" and then combine it with the equivalent phrase for "you say".

Thought: The issue seems to be that the `web_search` tool is returning `None`, and therefore, the final answer is also `None`.                               
                                                                                                                                                             
I'll try to debug this by printing out more information about what's being returned by the `web_search` tool.

Stanislaus Ulam was a Polish-American mathematician. He worked on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos and later helped design the hydrogen bomb. In this 
interview, he discusses his work at Los Alamos and his relationship with J. Robert Oppenheimer, Hans Bethe, John von Neumann, Enrico Fermi, and other 
scientists. He also discusses Oppenheimer’s varied reputation within the physics community. In particular, Ulam was frustrated by Oppenheimer’s wordiness, 
which he and some other scientists perceived as pompous and superfluous. Ulam also explains his thoughts on creativity in math and physics, and why he is a 
proponent of nuclear power.

### Transcript:

**Stanislaus Ulam**: You know, after forty-five years in this country, my accent is still very hard.

**Martin Sherwin**: That’s all right. I still have a Brooklyn accent.

**Ulam**:  Oh, you do?

**Sherwin**: I left Brooklyn twenty years ago. I think even though I do know a lot of the answers to some of the questions I’m going to ask you from your 
book—

**Ulam**:  Yes.

**Sherwin**: I think it would be useful in terms of putting it on tape and perhaps getting some other kinds of responses that aren’t in your book, just to 
sort of start from the beginning.

**Ulam**:  All right, fine. You want to have a copy of my book? I have it here.

**Sherwin**: I have a copy.

**Ulam**:  Well, yes, but I mean, if you have questions.

**Sherwin**: Oh, no, that’s okay. I know what I’m going to ask. I would like to know when you first met [J. Robert] Oppenheimer.

**Ulam**:  Here.

**Sherwin**: When you first, well, any time?

**Ulam**:  Here, here in Los Alamos. End of 1943 or first few days of 1944, when I came.

**Sherwin**: Now, did he recruit you?

**Ulam**:  No. It was [John] von Neumann and Bethe, Hans Bethe. No, von Neumann wrote me a letter saying that Hans Bethe—you know Bethe?

**Sherwin**: Oh, sure, sure.

**Ulam**:  He and some other people would like me to come. It took two months before all the formalities and, you know, during the war, reservations on the 
train and all kinds of sort of bureaucratic things.

**Sherwin**: Right. Where were you at the time?

**Ulam**:  I was a young assistant professor in Wisconsin, Madison. The University of Wisconsin.

**Sherwin**: Right. When you got there, you worked in the Theoretical Division?

**Ulam**:  Yes, right.

**Sherwin**: Okay. You worked on what?

**Ulam**:  Well, in the beginning, I just discussed things with many people here. At first I worked on something connected with thermonuclear reactions. Then
I worked by myself on probability problems, namely branching processes in general.

**Sherwin**: Now, I have a list here from the Manhattan Project records, a collection of the papers of the different division heads or group heads.

**Ulam**:  Yes, right.

**Sherwin**: Did you work under? In Bethe’s division?

**Ulam**:  Bethe’s, Bethe’s division. There was a group of [Edward] Teller’s.

**Sherwin**: Right.

**Ulam**: Oh, you have the things?

**Sherwin**: Right.

**Ulam**: Well, I don’t know, there are some reports I wrote. But I don’t think that would be here.

**Sherwin**: This is Teller’s, for example.

**Ulam**: Teller, yes, reports. Here is [Robert] Bacher, with somebody else’s division. Ulam’s, you don’t have it here, but I had written some reports.

**Sherwin**: Oh, you were a division leader at the time?

**Ulam**: No, I was not, no.

**Sherwin**: Now, in terms of just glancing through people down the Teller list then, two or three—

**Ulam**:  Yes, yes. Uranium, Columbia, Hans Bethe, [Robert] Christy. What does that mean?

**Sherwin**: These are just the—

**Ulam**:  Oh, joint papers. Oh, no.

**Sherwin**: No, these aren’t—

**Ulam**:  These are the problems, yes?

**Sherwin**: These are the titles of folders.

**Ulam**:  Oh, folders, yes.

**Sherwin**: Right. Do you recognize anything that you might have worked on?

**Ulam**:  Well, thermonuclear reactions and the questions of radiation. Certainly I worked—there are some reports. You can find them—I don’t know, they are 
non-classified, some of them, and some of them may be classified—with [David] Hawkins, on probability. There is branching process, like one neutron makes few
more and these make few more and so on, the mathematics of that. But that has nothing to do with Oppenheimer.

**Sherwin**: No, not yet. But, I’m, in certain ways—

**Ulam**:  That was during the war. After the war, of course, I worked on all kinds of problems, hydrodynamics and the H-bomb and so on.

**Sherwin**: Right, right. No, I’m familiar with that. Now, when did you first run into Oppenheimer?

**Ulam**:  Second day I was here, [inaudible].

**Sherwin**: In his office?

**Ulam**:  Socially, yes. I don’t know, in the corridor, socially, in somebody’s office, von Neumann. Because von Neumann was an old friend of mine, and we 
worked together before. We talked about all kinds of problems. It was great excitement here, of course, and nobody knew for sure what would happen out of 
this thing. There were many technical difficulties and problems of whether the thing will go at all.

**Sherwin**: Right.

**Ulam**:  How to assemble the bomb and neutron problems, purely experimental physics problems. Lots of theory, too.

**Sherwin**: How involved was Oppenheimer with your work?

**Ulam**:  My own, he wasn’t. I mean, I don’t how many people were, certainly over a thousand. So, he wouldn’t know every single thing. But he was 
incredible. He really had an idea of what’s going on, what the main problems are, the status, and every sort of colloquia, where the overall picture and the 
status of the work was described, oh, every week. Then there were seminars in addition.

**Sherwin**: Do you remember the first seminar that you went to, a colloquium?

**Ulam**:  No. It was very, very high level, of course, scientifically, and the atmosphere was informal. Oppenheimer would make comments on technical points 
throughout. He was incredibly quick, that was his main characteristic, I would say. Anticipating, in a conversation, he was anticipating what the other 
person would say. He was not, probably, as great a physicist as [Enrico] Fermi at all, or [Niels] Bohr or [Albert] Einstein. There is no real question of 
that. But a very, very good physicist.

**Sherwin**: Would you say that—

**Ulam**:  I mean, it’s hard to make comparisons.

**Sherwin**: No, I know, but I would like to hear you try anyway.

**Ulam**:  Yes. Yes.

**Sherwin**: How would you differentiate them as physicists?

**Ulam**:  Well, I’ll tell you. Or let me ask you first, what kind of book are you writing?

**Sherwin**: It’s a biography.

**Ulam**:  His whole life?

**Sherwin**: His whole life. But it’s not going to be a day-by-day account of what Robert Oppenheimer did. In a sense, I want to use him for a springboard 
for understanding the transition of science from the ‘30s through the ‘50s.

**Ulam**:  Yes.

**Sherwin**: Especially in relation to politics.

**Ulam**:  Yes. Have you seen such books as Laura Fermi’s?

**Sherwin**: Oh, sure.

**Ulam**:  Visitors and—

**Sherwin**: Yes.

**Ulam**: Because there was a change due to this influx of all kinds of scientists in many fields.

**Sherwin**: Right. Well, the first change is due to political occurrences in Europe.

**Ulam**:  Yes.

**Sherwin**: That was the change in America. The second change is because of nuclear weapons and the Cold War.

**Ulam**:  Radar also.

**Sherwin**: Radar, right.

**Ulam**:  These were the two big projects. But already in World War I there were mathematicians, physicists, and chemists engaged, of course, in all kinds 
of research.

**Sherwin**: But after the war, they are not politically important, politically visible.

**Ulam**:  That’s right.

**Sherwin**: That’s what the big transition is from World War I to World War II.

**Ulam**:  Yes, and space and so on.

**Sherwin**: That’s right.

**Ulam**:  It’s all very scientific.

**Sherwin**: Yeah. Another thing that interests me very much is the McCarthy period.

**Ulam**:  Yes.

**Sherwin**: Of course, Oppenheimer, given the circumstances of his relationship with the AEC [Atomic Energy Commission], etc., is a very good vehicle for 
that. So that’s the kind of book that I would like it to be. Therefore, I’m interested, naturally, in not only personal aspects of Oppenheimer’s character, 
I’m also interested in the quality of his mind, of h

w York State.

**Ulam**:  Yes, but it’s chemical. It’s not nuclear.

**Sherwin**: Yeah.

**Ulam**:  That is something new and getting worse, the chemical pollution.

**Sherwin**: It’s getting terrible.

**Ulam**:  Yeah, but it’s the effect of ten thousand times worse than any possible nuclear thing. Now, there are no demonstrations with guitar-players, is 
there? Could somebody just tell me why?

**Sherwin**: I think that the danger was not— it sort of snuck up on you. There was no drama involved.

**Ulam**:  People are not that irrational that they have to have a drama, some slogans or catchwords like nuclear [inaudible].

**Sherwin**: Yeah.

**Ulam**:  Because it really is, literally, thousands of times worse. You don’t see any demonstrations.

**Sherwin**: I think that there will always be a hostility to science, or a certain dimension of it.

**Ulam**:  There used to be admiration of science in this country, in the population.

**Sherwin**: It’s cyclical. It’s really cyclical.

**Ulam**:  They were this, at one time, you’re right, there’s no-nothing groups who—

**Sherwin**: That’s right, it goes up.

**Ulam**:  So now there’s the same thing again.

**Sherwin**: Yeah, and now science is—

**Ulam**:  Evil.

**Sherwin**: Coming up against a lot of criticism.

**Ulam**:  Yes, because of this feeling that people don’t understand it, so they are against it.

**Sherwin**: Yeah.

**Ulam**:  But on the other hand, maybe so many think of going to a dentist now and 300 years ago having—

**Sherwin**: Oh, wow.

**Ulam**: No operations or painkillers, everything. That’s right.

**Sherwin**: One of the things that I think, to a certain degree, science is responsible for some of the reaction to it. Because the public figures in 
science have often put science forward as being something that will solve all problems. Then when people—

**Ulam**:  Still have problems.

**Sherwin**: Expect those problems to be solved, and new problems develop as a result of efforts to solve A. You try to solve A and you end up with problem 
B. In fact, you might solve A, but people get very angry that B occurred.

**Ulam**:  Yes, some people, or many people, yes. Not everybody.

**Sherwin**: No, but even some scientists. One of the things that’s interesting—

**Ulam**:  Well, those that feel not so successful start making, as I said, business out of various things.

**Sherwin**: But of course, one of the things that’s interesting to me in terms of studying science in the political environment is that science has become 
much more interesting. Because—

**Ulam**:  The impact on your life.

**Sherwin**: Well, also the science community is a more general reflection of the whole spectrum of American political life now. It used to be, when science 
was smaller and more progressive, that all scientists thought alike for the—

**Ulam**:  Yes. Oh, yes, now there are disgruntled ones, of whom there must be many.

**Sherwin**: There is.

**Ulam**:  Take off and join these protestors.

**Sherwin**: Yeah.

**Ulam**:  Just because they are disgruntled scientists.

**Sherwin**: But there are a lot of—

**Ulam**: I’m unfair to a few.

**Sherwin**: I think so.

**Ulam**: On the whole it’s correct.

**Sherwin**: Well, I think that you find now a lot of young physicists getting very involved with environmental questions and other things, even before they 
had a chance to fail.

**Ulam**:  But what does it mean, getting involved? What do they do?

**Sherwin**: Well, they become interested in questions that—

**Ulam**:  I know, but has anything been done to improve it or help? I don’t see it, you know. It’s all so natural for young people to be against the 
previous generation.

**Sherwin**: Yes.

**Ulam**:  All of us, this is very natural.

**Sherwin**: Yes. That’s a very healthy thing.

**Ulam**:  Yeah, the grandchildren—I remember when I was very young, certainly less than ten. Some old relative, uncle, great-uncle, my father was telling us
a joke and I overheard it: “Why do you like grandchildren so much? Because they are enemies of our enemies.”

**Sherwin**: Yes. That’s very good. I love that. That’s very, yes. I think that’s probably a very good note to end on, sums up.

**Ulam**:  But unfortunately, I didn’t know Oppenheimer enough to tell you more.

**Sherwin**: As I said, I enjoyed reading your book very much.

**Ulam**:  Well, thank you.

**Sherwin**: I’m delighted to have a chance to talk to you.

**Ulam**:  No, no, it’s a pleasure for me.

**Sherwin**: Freeman Dyson said that reading the book was just like hearing you talk.

**Ulam**:  Is that good or bad?

**Sherwin**: No, it was good! That it was very much you.

**Ulam**:  He [Oppenheimer] realized that his creativity was not quite what he would wish to be.

**Sherwin**: The creativity?

**Ulam**:  In physics.

**Sherwin**: In physics does not match the—

**Ulam**:  The intelligence, the quickness, the brilliance.

**Sherwin**: Do you think that was involved in—

**Ulam**:  I felt it, but this was a pure guess, as I think, a gratuitous guess on my part.

**Sherwin**: Other people have said that. I think that—

**Ulam**:  No, I was saying that, but people must have read what—

**Sherwin**: People who read it—

**Ulam**:  Yes, maybe, I don’t know. As I say, it’s a gratuitous guess.

**Sherwin**: Do you think that has something to do with personality?

**Ulam**:  Oh, yes, with philosophy, political views, social views.

**Sherwin**: What’s your sense of creativity in science? What is its origin?

**Ulam**:  If I knew it, I would be creative.

**Sherwin**: I’m sure you were creative. Do scientists talk about those sorts of things?

**Ulam**:  Very little. Sometimes, mathematicians, for example, will discuss the sort of [inaudible] [0:25:28] who is better than who, which is on the whole 
meaningless, unless you say it with, okay, on the whole, Einstein was better than some young instructor in some simple college, that much you can say. But 
almost rigorously, and otherwise it’s—

**Sherwin**: But they never talk about the—have you ever read a book by—

**Ulam**:  No, books about the nature of creativity in mathematics by [Henri] Poincaré. I love books with articles. [George] Polya, you may have heard of 
him, a mathematician who is now ninety years old, wrote a very nice series of essays and mentions in his books. [Jacques] Hadamard, the famous French 
mathematician, wrote something about the nature of creativity.

But really little, because people don’t know. You cannot explain how a chess player really thinks. There are many books written by the chess champions, but 
they cannot explain how they really think or react or [inaudible].

**Sherwin**: I think it’s probably a good thing.

**Ulam**:  Probably [inaudible].

**Sherwin**: Then they would make a business out of creativity.

**Ulam**:  Exactly, immediately, there would be—

**Sherwin**: Well, very good.

Manhattan Project Locations:

* [Los Alamos, NM](/voices/oral-histories?_location=los-alamos-nm)

Stanislaus Ulam was a Polish-American mathematician. He worked on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos and later helped design the hydrogen bomb. In this interview, he discusses his work at Los Alamos and his relationship with J. Robert Oppenheimer, Hans Bethe, John von Neumann, Enrico Fermi, and other scientists. He also discusses Oppenheimer’s varied reputation within the physics community. In particular, Ulam was frustrated by Oppenheimer’s wordiness, which he and some other scientists perceived as pompous and superfluous. Ulam also explains his thoughts on creativity in math and physics, and why he is a proponent of nuclear power.

### Transcript:

**Stanislaus Ulam**: You know, after forty-five years in this country, my accent is still very hard.

**Martin Sherwin**: That’s all right. I still have a Brooklyn accent.

**Ulam**:  Oh, you do?

**Sherwin**: I left Brooklyn twenty years ago. I think even though I do know a lot of the answers to some of the questions I’m going to ask you from your book—

**Ulam**:  Yes.

**Sherwin**: I think it would be useful in terms of putting it on tape and perhaps getting some other kinds of responses that aren’t in your book, just to sort of start from the beginning.

**Ulam**:  All right, fine. You want to have a copy of my book? I have it here.

**Sherwin**: I have a copy.

**Ulam**:  Well, yes, but I mean, if you have questions.

**Sherwin**: Oh, no, that’s okay. I know what I’m going to ask. I would like to know when you first met [J. Robert] Oppenheimer.

**Ulam**:  Here.

**Sherwin**: When you first, well, any time?

**Ulam**:  Here, here in Los Alamos. End of 1943 or first few days of 1944, when I came.

**Sherwin**: Now, did he recruit you?

**Ulam**:  No. It was [John] von Neumann and Bethe, Hans Bethe. No, von Neumann wrote me a letter saying that Hans Bethe—you know Bethe?

**Sherwin**: Oh, sure, sure.

**Ulam**:  He and some other people would like me to come. It took two months before all the formalities and, you know, during the war, reservations on the train and all kinds of sort of bureaucratic things.

**Sherwin**: Right. Where were you at the time?

**Ulam**:  I was a young assistant professor in Wisconsin, Madison. The University of Wisconsin.

**Sherwin**: Right. When you got there, you worked in the Theoretical Division?

**Ulam**:  Yes, right.

**Sherwin**: Okay. You worked on what?

**Ulam**:  Well, in the beginning, I just discussed things with many people here. At first I worked on something connected with thermonuclear reactions. Then I worked by myself on probability problems, namely branching processes in general.

**Sherwin**: Now, I have a list here from the Manhattan Project records, a collection of the papers of the different division heads or group heads.

**Ulam**:  Yes, right.

**Sherwin**: Did you work under? In Bethe’s division?

**Ulam**:  Bethe’s, Bethe’s division. There was a group of [Edward] Teller’s.

**Sherwin**: Right.

**Ulam**: Oh, you have the things?

**Sherwin**: Right.

**Ulam**: Well, I don’t know, there are some reports I wrote. But I don’t think that would be here.

**Sherwin**: This is Teller’s, for example.

**Ulam**: Teller, yes, reports. Here is [Robert] Bacher, with somebody else’s division. Ulam’s, you don’t have it here, but I had written some reports.

**Sherwin**: Oh, you were a division leader at the time?

**Ulam**: No, I was not, no.

**Sherwin**: Now, in terms of just glancing through people down the Teller list then, two or three—

**Ulam**:  Yes, yes. Uranium, Columbia, Hans Bethe, [Robert] Christy. What does that mean?

**Sherwin**: These are just the—

**Ulam**:  Oh, joint papers. Oh, no.

**Sherwin**: No, these aren’t—

**Ulam**:  These are the problems, yes?

**Sherwin**: These are the titles of folders.

**Ulam**:  Oh, folders, yes.

**Sherwin**: Right. Do you recognize anything that you might have worked on?

**Ulam**:  Well, thermonuclear reactions and the questions of radiation. Certainly I worked—there are some reports. You can find them—I don’t know, they are non-classified, some of them, and some of them may be classified—with [David] Hawkins, on probability. There is branching process, like one neutron makes few more and these make few more and so on, the mathematics of that. But that has nothing to do with Oppenheimer.

**Sherwin**: No, not yet. But, I’m, in certain ways—

**Ulam**:  That was during the war. After the war, of course, I worked on all kinds of problems, hydrodynamics and the H-bomb and so on.

**Sherwin**: Right, right. No, I’m familiar with that. Now, when did you first run into Oppenheimer?

**Ulam**:  Second day I was here, [inaudible].

**Sherwin**: In his office?

**Ulam**:  Socially, yes. I don’t know, in the corridor, socially, in somebody’s office, von Neumann. Because von Neumann was an old friend of mine, and we worked together before. We talked about all kinds of problems. It was great excitement here, of course, and nobody knew for sure what would happen out of this thing. There were many technical difficulties and problems of whether the thing will go at all.

**Sherwin**: Right.

**Ulam**:  How to assemble the bomb and neutron problems, purely experimental physics problems. Lots of theory, too.

**Sherwin**: How involved was Oppenheimer with your work?

**Ulam**:  My own, he wasn’t. I mean, I don’t how many people were, certainly over a thousand. So, he wouldn’t know every single thing. But he was incredible. He really had an idea of what’s going on, what the main problems are, the status, and every sort of colloquia, where the overall picture and the status of the work was described, oh, every week. Then there were seminars in addition.

**Sherwin**: Do you remember the first seminar that you went to, a colloquium?

**Ulam**:  No. It was very, very high level, of course, scientifically, and the atmosphere was informal. Oppenheimer would make comments on technical points throughout. He was incredibly quick, that was his main characteristic, I would say. Anticipating, in a conversation, he was anticipating what the other person would say. He was not, probably, as great a physicist as [Enrico] Fermi at all, or [Niels] Bohr or [Albert] Einstein. There is no real question of that. But a very, very good physicist.

**Sherwin**: Would you say that—

**Ulam**:  I mean, it’s hard to make comparisons.

**Sherwin**: No, I know, but I would like to hear you try anyway.

**Ulam**:  Yes. Yes.

**Sherwin**: How would you differentiate them as physicists?

**Ulam**:  Well, I’ll tell you. Or let me ask you first, what kind of book are you writing?

**Sherwin**: It’s a biography.

**Ulam**:  His whole life?

**Sherwin**: His whole life. But it’s not going to be a day-by-day account of what Robert Oppenheimer did. In a sense, I want to use him for a springboard for understanding the transition of science from the ‘30s through the ‘50s.

**Ulam**:  Yes.

**Sherwin**: Especially in relation to politics.

**Ulam**:  Yes. Have you seen such books as Laura Fermi’s?

**Sherwin**: Oh, sure.

**Ulam**:  Visitors and—

**Sherwin**: Yes.

**Ulam**: Because there was a change due to this influx of all kinds of scientists in many fields.

**Sherwin**: Right. Well, the first change is due to political occurrences in Europe.

**Ulam**:  Yes.

**Sherwin**: That was the change in America. The second change is because of nuclear weapons and the Cold War.

**Ulam**:  Radar also.

**Sherwin**: Radar, right.

**Ulam**:  These were the two big projects. But already in World War I there were mathematicians, physicists, and chemists engaged, of course, in all kinds of research.

**Sherwin**: But after the war, they are not politically important, politically visible.

**Ulam**:  That’s right.

**Sherwin**: That’s what the big transition is from World War I to World War II.

**Ulam**:  Yes, and space and so on.

**Sherwin**: That’s right.

**Ulam**:  It’s all very scientific.

**Sherwin**: Yeah. Another thing that interests me very much is the McCarthy period.

**Ulam**:  Yes.

**Sherwin**: Of course, Oppenheimer, given the circumstances of his relationship with the AEC [Atomic Energy Commission], etc., is a very good vehicle for that. So that’s the kind of book that I would like it to be. Therefore, I’m interested, naturally, in not only personal aspects of Oppenheimer’s character, I’m also interested in the quality of his mind, of his leadership. But I’m also interested in the scientific environment in which he worked.

**Ulam**:  Yeah, well, you can write volumes about it.

**Sherwin**: Yes, I know, and I have to keep it—

**Ulam**:  I didn’t know him terribly well at all. During the war, occasional visits, and after the war more. But I formed a very early opinion of him after hearing his talks in the colloquia and conversations.

**Sherwin**: How would you describe that opinion? He was quick?

**Ulam**:  Very brilliant. I will say brilliant person, whatever, you know, the general meaning of the word is as accepted. If I say, he has done some very nice things before the war in theoretical physics. Of course, after the war, he was so engaged politically that he didn’t have time.

**Sherwin**: Right. Very few post-war—

**Ulam**:  Yes. There was a lesson I remember, he took part in technical discussions at the Institute [for Advanced Study] when I was visiting there several times. He kept abreast. He tried to be—well, I hate this word, but to describe it to you—sophisticated.

**Sherwin**: Do you think that was—

**Ulam**:  He did not have the simplicities of Fermi, not to mention somebody like [George] Gamow, who was always very elementary and non-mathematical. He was very good in mathematical techniques, Oppenheimer was.

**Sherwin**: [Emilio] Segre, I think it was, who told me the story that Fermi passed on to him. That he went to a seminar at the Institute, and he said he didn’t understand a word of what was being said.

**Ulam**:  Fermi didn’t?

**Sherwin**: Yes.

**Ulam**:  Well, if Fermi didn’t, it didn’t make sense in that case.

**Sherwin**: He didn’t understand anything. He said, ‘The only thing I understood was at the very end, the very last sentence. Oppenheimer then said, ‘This is Fermi’s theory of so and so.’” That’s a story Segre always tells in order to show how complicated Oppenheimer was often making things that should have been described in a much more simple—

**Ulam**:  Well, very few people had the talent, genius of Fermi for doing things in the natural, simple way. Fermi could use all the mathematics he wanted to, but when it wasn’t necessary, he wouldn’t. Some other people, you know, liked to, well, show the techniques. But the gist of the matter is something else.

**Sherwin**: Now, do you recall any of Oppenheimer’s papers from the 1930s, any of his work?

**Ulam**:  Well, some very famous work on, I think, leading to the theory of, yes, neutron stars. Neutron stars first and ultimately black holes. He had some joint papers and very good technical papers, but no great discovery comparable to some of [Werner] Heisenberg, [Julian] Schwinger, or Fermi, I would think. But I’m not a physicist, really.

**Sherwin**: What you say fits in with—

**Ulam**:  What other people say, yes.

**Sherwin**: What others have said. Did you ever discuss—

**Ulam**:  He tried to be sophisticated and use complicated language, similes, which I reacted to rather—I mean inwardly, privately—perhaps negatively. I myself prefer simplicity and natural description, if possible.

**Sherwin**: Do you think that that’s a sure way not to accomplish what you’re capable of accomplishing?

**Ulam**:  No, it’s not a sure way not to do it, but it certainly doesn’t help. Because it puts you on tangents, then on the form or appearance of things, it might, it might. But I think he was a very good physicist, no question about it, and had very good students. I think that perhaps is his main achievement. He, I think, was one of the first, or the first, to show the new quantum theory in this country, in the—

**Sherwin**: Yes, late ‘20s and early ‘30s.

**Ulam**:  Yes, exactly. He was precautious, perhaps. I don’t remember exactly when he started this.

**Sherwin**: Yes, he came here, well, in the late—

**Ulam**:  He came from Göttingen, I think.

**Sherwin**: That’s right.

**Ulam**:  He was a very curious person, very curious.

**Sherwin**: In what ways?

**Ulam**:  Well, some of his characteristics didn’t match his technical brilliance, in my opinion. For example, giving colloquia to the general public, he would use, I would say, to my taste, too much phraseology and expression. Sometimes, you could have suspected, I don’t think it was quite right, to sort of snow people. But not the really extremely well-educated ones, but sort of medium-educated people.

**Sherwin**: Well, one thing that you might not know that is perhaps some of the source of the nature of his language.

**Ulam**:  Yes?

**Sherwin**: He was very much a poet as a youngster, wrote beautiful poetry.

**Ulam**:  Oh, really? Yes, so that would be very nice.

**Sherwin**: Very extensive, both in French and in English.

**Ulam**:  Yes.

**Sherwin**: I think kept it up all his life.

**Ulam**:  Now that surprised me, because in his speech, I would say it was almost the opposite. It was the sounds of things, and not evoking really any deeper things. You understand that?

**Sherwin**: But in the construction of the sentences, one of the things that you notice is a meter, that they have a structure.

**Ulam**:  Yes. Now, have you read some of his lectures? How are they called? They are named after somebody, several lectures in London.

**Sherwin**: Well, there’s one—

**Ulam**:  In England, and then—

**Sherwin**: Oh, the Reith Lectures.

**Ulam**:  The Reith Lectures and so on.

**Sherwin**: Yes, yes, I have.

**Ulam**:  Now, I would say the content doesn’t quite match the—I don’t know how you feel.

**Sherwin**: Well, that’s interesting. You see, I’m not a scientist.

**Ulam**: You react to the—

**Sherwin**: I read them many, many years ago, even before I read the book.

**Ulam**:  Oh, people are fascinated in the colloquia by his delivery and general presentation of things. I had not such a terribly deep impression of it.

**Sherwin**: Now, did you feel that what he was doing was skirting around the issues, rather than coming to grips with them?

**Ulam**:  No, it’s not the right expression, skirting around.

**Sherwin**: What I’m trying to do is get a sense of—

**Ulam**:  It was frosting on the cake in some way, often. But sometimes, occasionally, there would be some very nice.

**Sherwin**: Yes. He certainly lived in two different worlds. One, a professional physicist, another, the public figure.

**Ulam**:  Yes, he became—I didn’t know him before.

**Sherwin**: He never really presented himself to the public as—

**Ulam**:  He had admirers.

**Sherwin**: Yes, he did.

**Ulam**: You know, students. But mixed, sometimes, feelings. Of course, I understand, I had no direct evidence of it, but he would be sometimes very rough with some students in conversation, or impatient.

**Sherwin**: He could be impatient with just about anybody.

**Ulam**:  He was terribly quick. That was, of course, [inaudible].

**Sherwin**: Now, do you remember any of the occasions at Los Alamos where you were in direct discussion with him?

**Ulam**:  Very short. It was purely technical ones.

**Sherwin**: Yeah. You worked with Teller on thermonuclear issues?

**Ulam**: Yes. In his group at first [inaudible].

**Sherwin**: Okay. Now, what was the relationship between Teller and Oppenheimer during the war?

**Ulam**:  Well, it had ups and downs. Of course, Oppenheimer appreciated Teller as a scientist, but Teller tried some of the things which were not in the mainstream of the work, and that created difficulties. Also, in some sense, it was sort of in discussion of the conflict, it was unfair, because Oppenheimer was a good actor, and it was much easier for him to, you know, react. It was unfair, slightly, on Oppenheimer’s part, since he was not really the—not supervisor, but you know?

**Sherwin**: Yes.

**Ulam**: As it were, over Teller. So Teller also became irritated, I think, on occasions. It was very complicated, the relation.

**Sherwin**: I’m trying to come to grips with that relationship, which is obviously an important one.

**Ulam**:  Teller tried very much to do some things of his own, as it were.

**Sherwin**: Well, as I understand—

**Ulam**:  Teller also changed, according to Gamow, as I mentioned in my book, changed very much after coming to Los Alamos and becoming involved in some of, more than was purely scientific, but wider import in public affairs.

**Sherwin**: He often talked about his concern with too much secrecy, for example. That was one of his—

**Ulam**:  Yeah, I don’t know how that was really mirroring of what he really thought, or was it—I have no idea.

**Sherwin**: Well, why do you say that? That’s interesting.

**Ulam**:  I don’t know, since I have no proofs of anything.

**Sherwin**: Because I have come across several letters in the Los Alamos files and in other files where Teller writes that he’s very concerned with the amount of secrecy that’s involved. After the war, he often talked about that. On the other hand—there always seems to be an “on the other hand,” you know, the Soviets are—

**Ulam**:  Yeah. I think Teller thought that some of his ideas might become better known, or could get support, if they were told to other people or other groups or other influences, on one hand. On the other hand, he, of course, felt that if he points out the dangers, the things that he had in mind might be pushed more, or he might be given more influence.

**Sherwin**: Now, in Teller’s insistence on working on the hydrogen bomb during the Los Alamos period, did he insist on that from the beginning, as far as you know, in the time in which you knew him?

**Ulam**:  I think, yes, that, actually, his group was finally sort of separated.

**Sherwin**: Separated from—

**Ulam**: He went to Fermi’s division, out of Bethe’s division. He worked, because he had more influence with, could be more to his, I’ll call it credit, on, the actions involving deuterium.

**Sherwin**: Now, was that something that was really off the track?

**Ulam**:  In the beginning, certainly, yes.

**Sherwin**: Yes. During the 
..._This content has been truncated to stay below 40000 characters_...
ork’s book, it seems factual, very factual. Dry, it’s a little dry.

**Sherwin**: No, but I meant the facts. There is nothing that you know that contradicts—

**Ulam**:  That is wrong? No, no.

**Sherwin**: Any of the issues.

**Ulam**:  No, no. Teller wrote a book, too, you know. Teller.

**Sherwin**: Yes. [Stanley A.] Blumberg—

**Ulam**:  There’s a book about Teller.

**Sherwin**: Yeah, Blumberg and—

**Ulam**:  By two guys, I wonder how this came to be written. Because for two professional writers to do something which may sell 10,000, 20,000 copies and work for two years, it’s very strange.

**Sherwin**: Well, I think they were hoping—

**Ulam**:  They were hired?

**Sherwin**: No, I think they hoped it would sell more.

**Ulam**:  Well no, no. I think they think—

**Sherwin**: It was not a very good book.

**Ulam**:  I looked at it.

**Sherwin**: But, biography for a guy like Teller, if it was a good book, it might have had a chance to really—because, he’s a very public person.

**Ulam**:  I don’t know, yes, because—

**Sherwin**: One of them is a—

**Ulam**:  You see, I completely agree with him 100% on the reactors, and building reactors for power stations. There’s an interview, maybe you have seen it, in the August *Playboy*magazine.

Then I sort of completely disagree with him in the second half or the second one-third. The last one-third of the article is about shelters, which seem to me to be completely futile and nonsense. But reactors, I must say, I feel good.

**Sherwin**: What does he argue?

**Ulam**:  For building the reactors.

**Sherwin**: Which kind?

**Ulam**:  Well, any kind that would give us energy.

**Sherwin**: Yeah. Of course, some kinds are more problematical than the others.

**Ulam**:  Well, yeah, but it’s [inaudible] engineering, technical questions. But I feel we should start building 200 reactors, mainly in states like Utah, Arizona, in these horrible deserts. If you can build them there, we have power brought by lines, wires, which we lose very little over even a thousand miles, you lose some 10%. There is absolute no danger around, because within 50, 100 miles, nobody lives there. I’m surprised that people don’t do it. Also, the problem of waste seems to me exaggerated. But, you may, I sort of gather, have different feelings.

**Sherwin**: I think the waste disposal problem is just not solved.

**Ulam**:  I don’t think it exists. Why not dig? There are already holes in Nevada for the testing of bombs. Just dump it two miles down. The volumes are small of the waste, relatively.

**Sherwin**: Yeah, but ultimately the stuff can seep into the water table.

**Ulam**:  How? It doesn’t go up. How does it come up? Three miles, it’s in the desert.

**Sherwin**: They seem to have to found no way, given the kind of half-life plutonium has, to make sure that—

**Ulam**:  No, but it’s so deep down! So what can it do? I don’t know what’s [inaudible,] because it seems to me by common sense it’s not really a problem at all.

**Sherwin**: It sure seems to be.

**Ulam**:  It seems to be, yes.

**Sherwin**: Yeah, right.

**Ulam**:  Well, transportation of it, but even so, it’s nothing explosive.

**Sherwin**: Oh, no, I know, yes. No, that’s not the problem. It’s whether or not it could—

**Ulam**:  What is effect? Because all these anti-nuclear demonstrations involve a lot of guitar-playing people, who know nothing about it. They have a good time, listen to songs, and create a great—

**Sherwin**: Do you know Ted Taylor?

**Ulam**:  Oh, yes, very well. He worked on this Orion business, which I actually started. I started that, you know, yeah, as you can read in not only my book, but in [John] McPhee’s book.

**Sherwin**: Yes. That’s right. Well, I’ve read it, yes, *The Curve of Binding Energy*.

**Ulam**:  Yeah, right.

**Sherwin**:  Right. I’d forgotten the name of the project.

**Ulam**:  Orion, yes. I knew him after the war [inaudible] very well. Then he left and started working on this Orion business. You see him now in Princeton, perhaps?

**Sherwin**: Yes. I was with the Center for Environmental Studies this year, and he’s a consultant there. Do you know Frank von Hippel, any of his work?

**Ulam**:  Oh, a biologist from Chicago?

**Sherwin**: No.

**Ulam**:  No?

**Sherwin**: He’s a—

**Ulam**:  There was an astronomer by that name.

**Sherwin**: Well, it could be. The family is—

**Ulam**:  Yeah, big family.

**Sherwin**: Yeah. A lot of physicists, and that type. But he’s a physicist at the Center, and writes a lot about this stuff.

**Ulam**:  Environmental?

**Sherwin**: Yeah. My sense of it is, that these people are very concerned about these problems, and they’re not guitar-players.

**Ulam**:  They are what?

**Sherwin**: They are not guitar-players.

**Ulam**:  No. Of course, you should be concerned, but also, it’s their business. It’s a new profession. Immediately in this country, people get into new professions and new jobs just—the day after Sputnik, [0:12:00] the day, suddenly there appears in the United States 1,000 space scientists.

**Sherwin**: Yes, right.

**Ulam**:  Well, you see, that’s the same, of course. Environmental, it’s a business.

**Sherwin**: Did Oppenheimer—

**Ulam**:  No. In those days, I don’t think it was discussed very much. Everybody saw that nuclear energy—my guess, purely guess, is that Oppenheimer also found that it would be a source of power and a very good thing.

**Sherwin**: Everybody certainly hoped it would be.

**Ulam**:  Yes.

**Sherwin**: I mean, that was the promise.

**Ulam**:  It should be, it could be. It’s just politics, which I don’t think it’s as innocent as it appears on the surface. I think various groups try to weaken the West in general.

**Sherwin**: How about the solar potential for the West?

**Ulam**:  Zero. [Inaudible], maybe couple percent. It certainly cannot make any difference.

**Sherwin**: I see.

**Ulam**:  A few percent by year 2000, what does it mean? Nothing.

**Sherwin**: Because solar just doesn’t have the potential to provide enough energy?

**Ulam**:  No, there is no way. I mean, you can have a few mirrors, heat houses, but you are not going to run big plants. The French have a few big mirrors, and you can in a couple of decades supply a few percent. You might as well forget about it for the next five, ten years.

Of course, the danger is the OPEC, the immediate danger to United States, right now. What the speech of—

**Sherwin**: [President Jimmy] Carter?

**Ulam**:  Carter. I like it, although he didn’t say enough. $140 billion does not strike me as very much, for ten years. You know, it’s like $100, less than $100 per person per year. We really should start going, even with coal. Of course, coal environmentally is worse than nuclear energy, by far.

**Sherwin**: Do you think there’s any chance of developing scrubber that would—

**Ulam**:  Oh, yes. They say that can be done to diminish the—but saying that the country will be scarred is another nonsense. It’s also inferiority feeling. People don’t understand the science of nuclear energy, so they feel irritated.

**Sherwin**: Well, I think that there’s something to that. But there’s also an analogy that should be made. People get irritated at big corporations and big companies because they don’t trust—

**Ulam**:  Right, okay.

**Sherwin**: They don’t trust them and they have evidence why they shouldn’t—

**Ulam**:  The government should supervise it, that’s something else, but they don’t say that. They are just against them. Okay, you can be against big corporations, but what do you do about automobiles? They are made by three big corporations.

**Sherwin**: Now, in terms of Oppenheimer, I suppose that there was nothing in terms of these modern issues that he was really involved in? All that came too late.

**Ulam**:  You mean the reactors?

**Sherwin**: Environmental stuff and reactors.

**Ulam**:  Yes, yes. Although [inaudible] was there, and all the factories were there.

**Sherwin**: Sure.

**Ulam**:  It’s just made up artificially now a little bit. The only thing that I see that is nice is that some streams are clean. In England, for example, the Thames River is now much cleaner. Of course when coal was used, [inaudible] bleak, dark.

**Sherwin**: Yes.

**Ulam**:  That is an improvement. I don’t know. This country is so vast that I think there’s plenty of environment.

**Sherwin**: You live in a different environment than I live in. You can see the sky from one end to another.

**Ulam**:  Princeton for me, climatically was a hell when I first arrived. I don’t even see how people live there during the summer. It’s humid.

**Sherwin**: Yeah, humidity.

**Ulam**:  Heat, there’s some, and it’s unlivable.

**Sherwin**: Everybody’s packed in together. I live a lot of my life in terms of—

**Ulam**:  It’s the climate.

**Sherwin**: How I think about problems. It’s very related to New York City.

**Ulam**:  Yes. But, still it’s an interesting—it’s nice to be there for a week or two.

**Sherwin**: Oh, it’s wonderful, no, but what I’m saying, I’m talking about environmentally.

**Ulam**:  But take Italy.

**Sherwin**: Okay.

**Ulam**:  The packing of people there is much greater than—or Holland. It’s just the climate that is so unpleasant here. Summer, heat. Hot humid summers, which to me—

**Sherwin**: Intolerable.

**Ulam**: Intolerable.

**Sherwin**: Yes. No, but what I’m thinking about is when you talk about environmental issues. One of the things that struck me about your point of view had to do with a sense of how vast the country is.

**Ulam**:  Yes.

**Sherwin**: The large deserts.

**Ulam**:  New York State.

**Sherwin**: You’re surrounded by space.

**Ulam**:  Well, go in New York State, fifty, sixty miles north.

**Sherwin**: Sure.

**Ulam**:  Marvelous woods.

**Sherwin**: Oh, it’s wonderful.

**Ulam**:  Yes.

**Sherwin**: But, as you’ve probably read in the *Times* about three or four weeks ago, there was a series of stories about pollution up in New York State.

**Ulam**:  Yes, but it’s chemical. It’s not nuclear.

**Sherwin**: Yeah.

**Ulam**:  That is something new and getting worse, the chemical pollution.

**Sherwin**: It’s getting terrible.

**Ulam**:  Yeah, but it’s the effect of ten thousand times worse than any possible nuclear thing. Now, there are no demonstrations with guitar-players, is there? Could somebody just tell me why?

**Sherwin**: I think that the danger was not— it sort of snuck up on you. There was no drama involved.

**Ulam**:  People are not that irrational that they have to have a drama, some slogans or catchwords like nuclear [inaudible].

**Sherwin**: Yeah.

**Ulam**:  Because it really is, literally, thousands of times worse. You don’t see any demonstrations.

**Sherwin**: I think that there will always be a hostility to science, or a certain dimension of it.

**Ulam**:  There used to be admiration of science in this country, in the population.

**Sherwin**: It’s cyclical. It’s really cyclical.

**Ulam**:  They were this, at one time, you’re right, there’s no-nothing groups who—

**Sherwin**: That’s right, it goes up.

**Ulam**:  So now there’s the same thing again.

**Sherwin**: Yeah, and now science is—

**Ulam**:  Evil.

**Sherwin**: Coming up against a lot of criticism.

**Ulam**:  Yes, because of this feeling that people don’t understand it, so they are against it.

**Sherwin**: Yeah.

**Ulam**:  But on the other hand, maybe so many think of going to a dentist now and 300 years ago having—

**Sherwin**: Oh, wow.

**Ulam**: No operations or painkillers, everything. That’s right.

**Sherwin**: One of the things that I think, to a certain degree, science is responsible for some of the reaction to it. Because the public figures in science have often put science forward as being something that will solve all problems. Then when people—

**Ulam**:  Still have problems.

**Sherwin**: Expect those problems to be solved, and new problems develop as a result of efforts to solve A. You try to solve A and you end up with problem B. In fact, you might solve A, but people get very angry that B occurred.

**Ulam**:  Yes, some people, or many people, yes. Not everybody.

**Sherwin**: No, but even some scientists. One of the things that’s interesting—

**Ulam**:  Well, those that feel not so successful start making, as I said, business out of various things.

**Sherwin**: But of course, one of the things that’s interesting to me in terms of studying science in the political environment is that science has become much more interesting. Because—

**Ulam**:  The impact on your life.

**Sherwin**: Well, also the science community is a more general reflection of the whole spectrum of American political life now. It used to be, when science was smaller and more progressive, that all scientists thought alike for the—

**Ulam**:  Yes. Oh, yes, now there are disgruntled ones, of whom there must be many.

**Sherwin**: There is.

**Ulam**:  Take off and join these protestors.

**Sherwin**: Yeah.

**Ulam**:  Just because they are disgruntled scientists.

**Sherwin**: But there are a lot of—

**Ulam**: I’m unfair to a few.

**Sherwin**: I think so.

**Ulam**: On the whole it’s correct.

**Sherwin**: Well, I think that you find now a lot of young physicists getting very involved with environmental questions and other things, even before they had a chance to fail.

**Ulam**:  But what does it mean, getting involved? What do they do?

**Sherwin**: Well, they become interested in questions that—

**Ulam**:  I know, but has anything been done to improve it or help? I don’t see it, you know. It’s all so natural for young people to be against the previous generation.

**Sherwin**: Yes.

**Ulam**:  All of us, this is very natural.

**Sherwin**: Yes. That’s a very healthy thing.

**Ulam**:  Yeah, the grandchildren—I remember when I was very young, certainly less than ten. Some old relative, uncle, great-uncle, my father was telling us a joke and I overheard it: “Why do you like grandchildren so much? Because they are enemies of our enemies.”

**Sherwin**: Yes. That’s very good. I love that. That’s very, yes. I think that’s probably a very good note to end on, sums up.

**Ulam**:  But unfortunately, I didn’t know Oppenheimer enough to tell you more.

**Sherwin**: As I said, I enjoyed reading your book very much.

**Ulam**:  Well, thank you.

**Sherwin**: I’m delighted to have a chance to talk to you.

**Ulam**:  No, no, it’s a pleasure for me.

**Sherwin**: Freeman Dyson said that reading the book was just like hearing you talk.

**Ulam**:  Is that good or bad?

**Sherwin**: No, it was good! That it was very much you.

**Ulam**:  He [Oppenheimer] realized that his creativity was not quite what he would wish to be.

**Sherwin**: The creativity?

**Ulam**:  In physics.

**Sherwin**: In physics does not match the—

**Ulam**:  The intelligence, the quickness, the brilliance.

**Sherwin**: Do you think that was involved in—

**Ulam**:  I felt it, but this was a pure guess, as I think, a gratuitous guess on my part.

**Sherwin**: Other people have said that. I think that—

**Ulam**:  No, I was saying that, but people must have read what—

**Sherwin**: People who read it—

**Ulam**:  Yes, maybe, I don’t know. As I say, it’s a gratuitous guess.

**Sherwin**: Do you think that has something to do with personality?

**Ulam**:  Oh, yes, with philosophy, political views, social views.

**Sherwin**: What’s your sense of creativity in science? What is its origin?

**Ulam**:  If I knew it, I would be creative.

**Sherwin**: I’m sure you were creative. Do scientists talk about those sorts of things?

**Ulam**:  Very little. Sometimes, mathematicians, for example, will discuss the sort of [inaudible] [0:25:28] who is better than who, which is on the whole meaningless, unless you say it with, okay, on the whole, Einstein was better than some young instructor in some simple college, that much you can say. But almost rigorously, and otherwise it’s—

**Sherwin**: But they never talk about the—have you ever read a book by—

**Ulam**:  No, books about the nature of creativity in mathematics by [Henri] Poincaré. I love books with articles. [George] Polya, you may have heard of him, a mathematician who is now ninety years old, wrote a very nice series of essays and mentions in his books. [Jacques] Hadamard, the famous French mathematician, wrote something about the nature of creativity.

But really little, because people don’t know. You cannot explain how a chess player really thinks. There are many books written by the chess champions, but they cannot explain how they really think or react or [inaudible].

**Sherwin**: I think it’s probably a good thing.

**Ulam**:  Probably [inaudible].

**Sherwin**: Then they would make a business out of creativity.

**Ulam**:  Exactly, immediately, there would be—

**Sherwin**: Well, very good.
