for clauses introduced by subordinating conjunctions such as 'although', 'which', and others.

Thought: It seems that my previous attempt was not effective in identifying the subordinate clauses.

approach.

Thought: It seems that my previous attempt was still not effective in identifying the subordinate clauses.

Thought: It seems that my previous attempt was still not effective in identifying the subordinate clauses.

Thought: It seems that my previous attempt was still not effective in identifying the subordinate clause.
