Thought: I can use the tool `wiki` to get the answer to the first question. If the answer is yes, I can then use the same tool to ask the second question.

Thought: Since I'm not allowed to use the `wiki` tool directly, I'll try using other tools to get the information. I can use the `document_qa` tool to search
for questions and answers related to geography.

However, I realize that `document_qa` might not be able to find a direct answer for this question.                                                           
                                                                                                                                                             
Thought: Since I'm stuck with the `document_qa` tool, I can try asking more specific questions related to geography. For example, I can ask about the cities 
in France or the capital of each region.

If this doesn't work, I might need to try other approaches or tools.

Thought: Since I'm still having trouble with the `document_qa` tool, I'll think of other ways to ask for information. What if I use a different tool, like   
`web_search`, to find the answer?
