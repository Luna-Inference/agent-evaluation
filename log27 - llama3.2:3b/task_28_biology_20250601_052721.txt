Thought: To answer this question, I need to use the tool `encyclopedia` to get information about the cells and their components. Then, I will search for the 
term "powerhouse of the cell" in the encyclopedia.

[Mitochondria - Definition, Function & Structure - Biology Dictionary](https://biologydictionary.net/mitochondria/)
Mitochondria (singular: mitochondrion) are organelles within eukaryotic cells that produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the main energy molecule used by the
cell. For this reason, the mitochondrion is sometimes referred to as "the powerhouse of the cell".

[Mitochondrion | Definition, Function, Structure, & Facts | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/science/mitochondrion)
Mitochondrion, organelle found in most eukaryotic cells, the primary function of which is to generate energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate. 
Mitochondria also store calcium for cell signaling activities, generate heat, and mediate cell growth and death. They typically are round to oval in shape.

[Mitochondria - Definition, Structure, Function - Science Notes and ...](https://sciencenotes.org/mitochondria-definition-structure-function/)
The plural of "mitochondrion" is "mitochondria." Functions of Mitochondria. While best-known for producing energy, mitochondria actually serve several 
important functions within the cell: ATP Production: Mitochondria are the site of oxidative phosphorylation and play a critical role in the production of ATP
through the electron ...

[Mitochondria: Form, function, and disease - Medical News Today](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320875)
People often refer to mitochondria as the powerhouses of the cell. Their main function is to generate the energy necessary to power cells, but they are also 
involved in cell signaling and death ...

[Mitochondria Function: A Simple Discussion and Diagram - Verywell Health](https://www.verywellhealth.com/mitochondria-function-8409605)
All living things are composed of cells. Each cell contains structural components called organelles (almost like mini organs) with specific functions. 
Mitochondria are a type of organelle. Mitochondria are distributed throughout the body. Every tissue and organ in the body is composed of cells, and ...

[Mitochondrion - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion)
A mitochondrion (pl. mitochondria) is an organelle found in the cells of most eukaryotes, such as animals, plants and fungi.Mitochondria have a double 
membrane structure and use aerobic respiration to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is used throughout the cell as a source of chemical energy. 
[2] They were discovered by Albert von Kölliker in 1857 [3] in the voluntary muscles of ...

[Mitochondria - National Human Genome Research Institute](https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Mitochondria)
Mitochondria are membrane-bound cell organelles (mitochondrion, singular) ... Those membranes function in the purpose of mitochondria, which is essentially 
to produce energy. That energy is produced by having chemicals within the cell go through pathways, in other words, be converted. And the process of that 
conversion produces energy in the ...

[Mitochondria - Definition, Structure, and Function with Diagram](https://www.sciencefacts.net/mitochondria.html)
The two main functions of mitochondria are: 1) promoting the growth of new cells and in cell multiplication, and 2) serving as the 'energy currency' of the 
cell by synthesizing high-energy phosphate molecule - ATP Other Important Functions:. Producing body heat by the accumulation of brown-fat; Controlling 
various cellular activities such as cell differentiation, cell signaling, cell ...

Mitochondria definition. Mitochondria (mitochondrion, singular) are membrane-bound organelles found in the cytoplasm of almost all eukaryotic cells but are 
absent in prokaryotic cells. The main function of mitochondria is to generate the energy needed to power a cell's biochemical reactions in the form of 
adenosine triphosphate (ATP).

[What Does The Mitochondria Do? | UCLA Medical School](https://medschool.ucla.edu/research/themed-areas/metabolism-research/mitochondria)
Of all of our cells' organelles - tiny organ-like structures with specialized functions within a cell - the mitochondria structure may be the most complex. 
Mitochondria have their own biology and a small number of genes but must import more than 1,500 different proteins, sometimes through both of its two 
membranes, to carry out myriad ...

[Mitochondrion - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion)
A mitochondrion (pl. mitochondria) is an organelle found in the cells of most eukaryotes, such as animals, plants and fungi.Mitochondria have a double 
membrane structure and use aerobic respiration to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is used throughout the cell as a source of chemical energy. 
[2] They were discovered by Albert von Kölliker in 1857 [3] in the voluntary muscles of ...

[Mitochondria - Definition, Function & Structure - Biology Dictionary](https://biologydictionary.net/mitochondria/)
Mitochondria (singular: mitochondrion) are organelles within eukaryotic cells that produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the main energy molecule used by the
cell. For this reason, the mitochondrion is sometimes referred to as "the powerhouse of the cell".

[Mitochondria: Form, function, and disease - Medical News Today](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320875)
Mitochondria are often referred to as the powerhouses of the cell. Their main function is to generate the energy necessary to power cells. But, there is more
to mitochondria than energy production.

[Mitochondrion | Definition, Function, Structure, & Facts | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/science/mitochondrion)
The number of mitochondria per cell varies widely—for example, in humans, erythrocytes (red blood cells) do not contain any mitochondria, whereas liver cells
and muscle cells may contain hundreds or even thousands. The only eukaryotic organism known to lack mitochondria is the oxymonad Monocercomonoides species. 
Mitochondria are unlike other cellular organelles in that they have two distinct ...

[Mitochondria - cell powerhouses — Science Learning Hub](https://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/resources/1839-mitochondria-cell-powerhouses)
The powerhouse function. When the breakdown products from the digestion of food find their way into the cell, a series of chemical reactions occur in the 
cytoplasm. This allows some of the energy locked up in these products to be released and incorporated into the universal energy supplier in cells known as 
ATP (adenosine triphosphate).

[Mitochondria - Definition, Structure, Function - Science Notes and ...](https://sciencenotes.org/mitochondria-definition-structure-function/)
General Cytoplasmic Distribution: In most cells, mitochondria disperse more or less equally throughout the cytoplasm. This distribution allows for efficient 
supply of ATP to various parts of the cell where energy is needed. Near High Energy Demand Sites: In cells with high energy demands, such as muscle cells or 
neurons, mitochondria occur in greater concentrations near sites where energy ...

[Mitochondria: Structure, Function, And Aerobic Respiration - Science ABC](https://www.scienceabc.com/nature/what-are-mitochondria.html)
Mitochondria are known as the 'Powerhouse of the cell'. Their immediate function is to convert glucose into ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate). ATP can be 
considered the 'currency' of the cell. It is the basic unit of energy that is required to power the chemical reactions in our body. The process of this 
conversion is known as aerobic respiration and it is the reason why humans need to ...

Thought: Based on the search results, it's clear that mitochondria are indeed referred to as the "powerhouse of the cell" because of their role in generating
energy for the cell through a process called cellular respiration.
