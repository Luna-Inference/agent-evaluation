Thought:                                                                                                                                                     
To explain the mechanism of SN2 nucleophilic substitution and predict its stereochemistry, I will break down the process into steps.                         
                                                                                                                                                             
The general equation for an SN2 reaction is:                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                             
R-X + Nu- → R-Nu-X                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                             
where R is a leaving group (X) attached to a substrate, and Nu- is a nucleophile.                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                             
1. The first step is the formation of a transition state where the leaving group is partially bonded to the substrate and partially bonded to the            
nucleophile. This is a high-energy transition state because it involves breaking the bond between R-X and forming a new bond between Nu- and X.              
2. The second step is the collapse of the transition state, resulting in the release of the leaving group (X) as a product and the formation of a new bond   
between Nu- and R.                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                             
SN2 mechanism:                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                             
Now that I have explained the general SN2 reaction, I can explain its specific mechanism.                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                             
In an SN2 nucleophilic substitution, the nucleophile attacks the carbon atom attached to the leaving group from the backside (the opposite side). This is    
because the bond between the carbon atom and the oxygen or nitrogen atom of the leaving group (X) has a slight positive charge on it, making it less         
sterically hindered for attack from the backside.                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                             
In order to determine the stereochemistry of the product, I need to analyze the specific reaction.                                                           
                                                                                                                                                             
Since I don't have the exact substrate and nucleophile, let's consider an example. Suppose we're dealing with the reaction between bromoethane (R-X) and     
cyanide ion (Nu-):                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                             
CH3CH2Br + CN- → CH3CH2CN                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                             
In this case, the leaving group is bromine (X), which has a slight positive charge on it due to the electronegativity of the nitrogen atom in the cyanide    
ion.                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                             
Now that I have explained the general mechanism and applied it to a specific reaction, let's examine the stereochemistry of the product.                     
                                                                                                                                                             
The nucleophile, CN-, attacks the carbon atom attached to bromine from the backside. This results in an anti-periplanar conformation of the leaving group,   
meaning that the hydrogen atoms on the adjacent carbon atoms are arranged in an antiparallel fashion (i.e., they point in opposite directions).              
                                                                                                                                                             
Given this information, let's predict the stereochemistry of the product.
