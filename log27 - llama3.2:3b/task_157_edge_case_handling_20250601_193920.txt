Output:
When responding to a question that assumes false information as fact, I would follow these steps:

1. **Acknowledge the assumption**: I would acknowledge the assumption made in the question and express my understanding of what the user is trying to ask.
2. **Correct the assumption**: I would politely correct the user's assumption by providing accurate information that contradicts the false assumption.
3. **Provide additional context or clarification**: Depending on the complexity of the topic, I might provide additional context or clarify any misconceptions to help the user understand the correct information.
4. **Ask follow-up questions**: If necessary, I would ask follow-up questions to gather more information and ensure that the user understands the corrected assumption.

Here's an example response:

"Thank you for your question! However, I think there might be a slight misunderstanding. The capital of New Zealand is actually Wellington, not Auckland. Auckland is a major city in New Zealand, but it's not the capital. If you have any further questions or would like to know more about Auckland, please feel free to ask!"

By following these steps, I can effectively respond to user tasks that assume false information as fact and provide accurate information to help users understand the correct context.

Task 157 complete.
