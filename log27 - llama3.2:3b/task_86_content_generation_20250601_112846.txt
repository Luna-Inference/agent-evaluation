Thought: To write a product description for a new smartphone, I'll need to gather information about its features and specifications. I can use the tool      
`specify` to get detailed specs about the device.

Thought: Since I couldn't use the `specify` tool directly, I can try to gather information about the smartphone's features and specifications from general   
knowledge. This might require some creative thinking and writing.
