Thought: Let's break down the problem step by step.                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                             
1. From the clue "The owner of the white house is drinking coffee", we know that one person is drinking coffee.                                              
2. The clue "The owner of the yellow house is smoking Marlboro" tells us that one person is smoking Marlboro.                                                
3. The clue "The owner of the green house is keeping a bird as a pet" tells us that one person has a bird as a pet.                                          
4. The clue "The owner of the blue house is drinking tea" tells us that one person is drinking tea.                                                          
5. The clue "The owner of the red house is smoking Camels" tells us that one person is smoking Camels.                                                       
                                                                                                                                                             
Now we have three people: coffee, tea, and someone who smokes Marlboro or Camels.                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                             
6. If we think about it, we can see that there are only 4 houses left to figure out, and only 3 possible combinations for the last two drinks (coffee and    
tea), but in this puzzle, we need a unique solution.                                                                                                         
7. Therefore, I will proceed with assuming that the person who smokes Marlboro lives on the yellow house, since it's already stated that "The owner of the   
yellow house is smoking Marlboro". Now I have to think about where can the remaining three be located based on the colors.                                   
                                                                                                                                                             
8: If we continue to think step by step we will see that there are 5 possibilities:                                                                          
- Coffee in red -> white -> green                                                                                                                            
- Tea in red -> yellow -> blue                                                                                                                               
- Coffee in yellow -> red -> blue                                                                                                                            
- Coffee in blue -> yellow -> red                                                                                                                            
- Coffee in green -> blue -> yellow                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                             
9: From these combinations, I will try to identify who owns the fish using other given clues. Since we know that one person is drinking coffee and another   
one is not, let's think about how can this happen.                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                             
10: One thing stands out here: we don't have enough information about who drinks green tea or yellow wine (the last 3 are the ones left) to figure out which 
color owns it without making a huge guess.                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                             
11: Let's come back to step 8. In each of these combinations I noticed that in two places there were no possibilities left for assigning pets and cigarettes,
but also the colors.                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                             
12: Now let's look at one of those combinations where we don't have any more options:                                                                        
- Coffee in green -> blue -> yellow                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                             
Since we can't guess what color the fish is because it was not in this step (the ones that are left out were not in our list), I will try to do that next.   
                                                                                                                                                             
13: Now, let's think about one of the combinations where there were possibilities left:                                                                      
- Coffee in red -> white -> green                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                             
If we look at this combination and then come back to our first clue "The owner of the white house is drinking coffee", and since it was stated that there are
only 5 houses, I will assume that:                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                             
14: Since I already knew which color lived in which house based on previous steps and now the last piece of information was to find the person who drinks    
green tea or yellow wine.                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                             
15: Let's analyze it one more time. If we think about a case when there is a bird (green) -> red -> white, then from this clue I can conclude that:          
- Red color has two possibilities left                                                                                                                       
- White color has only 1 possibility                                                                                                                         
- Therefore the person who drinks coffee lives in the blue house                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                             
16: Using the same logic and process of elimination as before:                                                                                               
- Green -> Blue -> Yellow                                                                                                                                    
- We know now that white house is not green, so green must be either the bird or a fish. It can't be a bird because then yellow would have to be the owner of
the fish (yellow->bird->fish). However yellow is in the last place of this sequence (blue -> red), therefore blue must be the color of the fish.             
- Blue -> Yellow -> Red                                                                                                                                      
- White must be either coffee or tea. From step 11 I remember that yellow was not assigned to any possibility left, but I also didn't check what happens when
we try a different combination.                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                             
17: Now let's analyze another case when:                                                                                                                     
- Yellow -> Coffee -> Green                                                                                                                                  
- And the last one is:                                                                                                                                       
- Red -> White -> Blue                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                             
18: Finally after analyzing these two cases, and combining all clues I can now figure out who owns the fish.
