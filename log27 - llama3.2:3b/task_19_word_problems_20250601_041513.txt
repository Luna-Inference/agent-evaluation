Thought: To find out how much flour is needed for 18 cookies, I need to first figure out the rate at which flour is used per cookie. Since we know that 2    
cups of flour are used for 12 cookies, I can calculate this rate and then use it to determine how much flour is needed for 18 cookies.

Thought: The tool call seems to have worked correctly, but the output wasn't printed as expected because I was trying to print directly in a function called 
`python_interpreter`, which isn't a valid way to use this tool.

Thought: Since the `print` statement is not producing any output, I should verify that it's actually being executed by the tool.                             
                                                                                                                                                             
It seems that the problem lies in how the tool handles the `python_interpreter` call. Instead of printing the result directly, I need to assign the result to
a variable and then pass that variable back to the `python_interpreter` function.

Thought: It seems that the `python_interpreter` tool call is still not producing any output, even though the code itself is correct.

executing the Python code?

prompts and print them directly in the Python code.
