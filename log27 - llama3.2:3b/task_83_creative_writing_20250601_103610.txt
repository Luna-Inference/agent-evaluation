Thought: I'll start by coming up with some words that relate to rain. Then I can use these words as inspiration for my poem. The tool `dictionary` will help 
me find the meanings of these words and potentially provide some insights.

Rainy days, so calm and grey
A drizzle falls, to brighten day
With misty drops, so fine and slow
The world outside, begins to glow

In this soft rain, I find my peace
A sense of calm, my worries release
The drizzle's gentle touch, on skin so fair
Invigorates the senses, without a care

So let the drizzle fall, and play
On roofs and pavement, all day
For in its misty veil, I see a friend
That brings new life, to all that ends

A drizzle falls, to brighten day
With misty drops, so fine and slow
The world outside, begins to glow

Poem:

Rainy days, so calm and grey
A drizzle falls, to brighten day
With misty drops, so fine and slow
The world outside, begins to glow

In this soft rain, I find my peace
A sense of calm, my worries release
The drizzle's gentle touch, on skin so fair
Invigorates the senses, without a care

So let the drizzle fall, and play
On roofs and pavement, all day
For in its misty veil, I see a friend
That brings new life, to all that ends

Rainy days, so calm and grey
A drizzle falls, to brighten day
With misty drops, so fine and slow
The world outside, begins to glow

In this soft rain, I find my peace
A sense of calm, my worries release
The drizzle's gentle touch, on skin so fair
Invigorates the senses, without a care

So let the drizzle fall, and play
On roofs and pavement, all day
For in its misty veil, I see a friend
That brings new life, to all that ends

Output message of the LLM: ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Thought: It seems like the issue is not with printing the poem itself, but rather with the output being None. This might be due to the way the `print()`     
function is working in this environment.                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                             
Since the `print()` function is not displaying any output, it's likely that the output is being redirected or suppressed somewhere in the process.           
                                                                                                                                                             
Let me try a different approach. Instead of printing the poem directly, I can assign it to a variable and then print the variable.

Poem:

Rainy days, so calm and grey
A drizzle falls, to brighten day
With misty drops, so fine and slow
The world outside, begins to glow

In this soft rain, I find my peace
A sense of calm, my worries release
The drizzle's gentle touch, on skin so fair
Invigorates the senses, without a care

So let the drizzle fall, and play
On roofs and pavement, all day
For in its misty veil, I see a friend
That brings new life, to all that ends

Thought: It seems like even assigning the poem to a variable and then printing it is not producing any output.

Out - Final answer: 
Rainy days, so calm and grey
A drizzle falls, to brighten day
With misty drops, so fine and slow
The world outside, begins to glow

In this soft rain, I find my peace
A sense of calm, my worries release
The drizzle's gentle touch, on skin so fair
Invigorates the senses, without a care

So let the drizzle fall, and play
On roofs and pavement, all day
For in its misty veil, I see a friend
That brings new life, to all that ends
