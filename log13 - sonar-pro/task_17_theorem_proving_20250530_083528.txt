            Here is your code snippet:
            ## Proof by Contradiction: \(\sqrt{2}\) Is Irrational

Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that \(\sqrt{2}\) is rational. Then by definition, we can write:
\[
\sqrt{2} = \frac{a}{b}
\\]
where \(a\) and \(b\) are integers with no common factors other than 1 (i.e., the fraction \(\frac{a}{b}\) is in lowest terms)[3\][4\][5\].

Squaring both sides gives:
\[
2 = \frac{a^2}{b^2}
\\]
\[
2b^2 = a^2
\\]

This equation implies that \(a^2\) is even (since it equals twice another integer), which further means that \(a\) must also be even (since only even numbers have even squares).

Let us write \(a = 2k\) for some integer \(k\). Substitute back into the equation:
\[
2b^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2
\\]
\[
2b^2 = 4k^2
\\]
\[
b^2 = 2k^2
\\]

This shows that \(b^2\) is also even, so \(b\) must be even as well.

But now both \(a\) and \(b\) are even, meaning they have a common factor of 2. This contradicts our earlier statement that \(a\) and \(b\) have no common factors other than 1; 
the original fraction was assumed to be in the lowest terms[5\].

> Therefore, our assumption that \(\sqrt{2}\) is rational leads to a contradiction. Thus, \(\sqrt{2}\) must be irrational[1\][3\][5\].

Thought: The previous response did not include any code block, which caused the error. The task requires using a code snippet following the format rules, even if the answer is  
mathematical. I'll write a succinct Python snippet that symbolically checks if √2 can be expressed as a ratio of integers (rational), and produces a contradiction. This will    
fulfill the code block requirement and illustrate the contradiction logic programmatically.
