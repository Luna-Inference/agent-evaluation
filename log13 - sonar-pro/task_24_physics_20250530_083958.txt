I'll solve this task step by step by deriving the wave equation from Maxwell's equations in vacuum.                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: First, I need to identify Maxwell's equations in vacuum and then work through the derivation process. From the search results, I can see several approaches to this     
derivation, so I'll follow the clearest path.

Thought: Now I'll work through the derivation. The key step is to take the curl of the curl equations (Faraday's Law and Ampère's Law) and use the vector identity for the curl  
of the curl.

Observation:                                                                                                                                                                     
Step 1: Take the curl of Faraday's Law: ∇×(∇×E) + ∇×(∂B/∂t) = 0                                                                                                                  
Using the vector identity: ∇×(∇×E) = ∇(∇·E) - ∇²E                                                                                                                                
Since ∇·E = 0 in vacuum, we get: ∇×(∇×E) = -∇²E                                                                                                                                  
Also, ∇×(∂B/∂t) = ∂(∇×B)/∂t                                                                                                                                                      
So we have: -∇²E + ∂(∇×B)/∂t = 0                                                                                                                                                 
From Ampère's Law: ∇×B = μ₀ε₀∂E/∂t                                                                                                                                               
Substituting: -∇²E + ∂(μ₀ε₀∂E/∂t)/∂t = 0                                                                                                                                         
Simplifying: -∇²E + μ₀ε₀∂²E/∂t² = 0                                                                                                                                              
Or: ∇²E = μ₀ε₀∂²E/∂t²                                                                                                                                                            
This is a wave equation of the form: ∇²E = (1/c²)∂²E/∂t² where c = 1/√(μ₀ε₀)                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I should also derive the wave equation for the magnetic field B to show that both E and B fields propagate as waves with the same speed.

Substituting: -∇²B - μ₀ε₀∂(-∂B/∂t)/∂t = 0                                                                                                                                        
Simplifying: -∇²B + μ₀ε₀∂²B/∂t² = 0                                                                                                                                              
Or: ∇²B = μ₀ε₀∂²B/∂t²                                                                                                                                                            
This is also a wave equation with the same speed c = 1/√(μ₀ε₀)

The wave equations for both E and B have the form:                                                                                                                               
∇²E = μ₀ε₀∂²E/∂t²                                                                                                                                                                
∇²B = μ₀ε₀∂²B/∂t²                                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Comparing with the standard wave equation ∇²ψ = (1/v²)∂²ψ/∂t², we can identify:                                                                                                  
1/v² = μ₀ε₀                                                                                                                                                                      
Therefore v = 1/√(μ₀ε₀) = c                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Maxwell calculated this value using known values of μ₀ and ε₀, obtaining approximately 3.1×10⁸ m/s                                                                               
This is within 3% of the modern value of c = 299,792,458 m/s                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: Finally, let me explain that these electromagnetic waves are transverse waves, which means they oscillate perpendicular to the direction of propagation.

The derivation of the wave equation from Maxwell's equations in vacuum follows these steps:                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, we start with Maxwell's equations in vacuum (where ρ = 0 and J = 0):                                                                                                      
1. ∇·E = 0                                                                                                                                                                       
2. ∇×E + ∂B/∂t = 0 (Faraday's Law)                                                                                                                                               
3. ∇·B = 0                                                                                                                                                                       
4. ∇×B - μ₀ε₀∂E/∂t = 0 (Ampère's Law with Maxwell's correction)                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
For the electric field E:                                                                                                                                                        
- Take the curl of Faraday's Law: ∇×(∇×E) + ∇×(∂B/∂t) = 0                                                                                                                        
- Using the vector identity ∇×(∇×E) = ∇(∇·E) - ∇²E and noting that ∇·E = 0:                                                                                                      
  ∇×(∇×E) = -∇²E                                                                                                                                                                 
- Also, ∇×(∂B/∂t) = ∂(∇×B)/∂t                                                                                                                                                    
- So we have: -∇²E + ∂(∇×B)/∂t = 0                                                                                                                                               
- From Ampère's Law: ∇×B = μ₀ε₀∂E/∂t                                                                                                                                             
- Substituting: -∇²E + μ₀ε₀∂²E/∂t² = 0                                                                                                                                           
- Rearranging: ∇²E = μ₀ε₀∂²E/∂t²                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
For the magnetic field B:                                                                                                                                                        
- Similarly taking the curl of Ampère's Law and applying the same vector identity:                                                                                               
- ∇²B = μ₀ε₀∂²B/∂t²                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Both equations have the form of the wave equation:                                                                                                                               
∇²ψ = (1/v²)∂²ψ/∂t²

The derivation of the wave equation from Maxwell's equations in vacuum follows these steps:                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, we start with Maxwell's equations in vacuum (where ρ = 0 and J = 0):                                                                                                      
1. ∇·E = 0                                                                                                                                                                       
2. ∇×E + ∂B/∂t = 0 (Faraday's Law)                                                                                                                                               
3. ∇·B = 0                                                                                                                                                                       
4. ∇×B - μ₀ε₀∂E/∂t = 0 (Ampère's Law with Maxwell's correction)                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
For the electric field E:                                                                                                                                                        
- Take the curl of Faraday's Law: ∇×(∇×E) + ∇×(∂B/∂t) = 0                                                                                                                        
- Using the vector identity ∇×(∇×E) = ∇(∇·E) - ∇²E and noting that ∇·E = 0:                                                                                                      
  ∇×(∇×E) = -∇²E                                                                                                                                                                 
- Also, ∇×(∂B/∂t) = ∂(∇×B)/∂t                                                                                                                                                    
- So we have: -∇²E + ∂(∇×B)/∂t = 0                                                                                                                                               
- From Ampère's Law: ∇×B = μ₀ε₀∂E/∂t                                                                                                                                             
- Substituting: -∇²E + μ₀ε₀∂²E/∂t² = 0                                                                                                                                           
- Rearranging: ∇²E = μ₀ε₀∂²E/∂t²                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
For the magnetic field B:                                                                                                                                                        
- Similarly taking the curl of Ampère's Law and applying the same vector identity:                                                                                               
- ∇²B = μ₀ε₀∂²B/∂t²                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Both equations have the form of the wave equation:                                                                                                                               
∇²ψ = (1/v²)∂²ψ/∂t²                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Where v = 1/√(μ₀ε₀) = c (the speed of light)

Execution logs:
Maxwell's equations in vacuum (where ρ = 0 and J = 0):
1. ∇·E = 0
2. ∇×E + ∂B/∂t = 0 (Faraday's Law)
3. ∇·B = 0
4. ∇×B - μ₀ε₀∂E/∂t = 0 (Ampère's Law with Maxwell's correction)
Step 1: Take the curl of Faraday's Law: ∇×(∇×E) + ∇×(∂B/∂t) = 0
Using the vector identity: ∇×(∇×E) = ∇(∇·E) - ∇²E
Since ∇·E = 0 in vacuum, we get: ∇×(∇×E) = -∇²E
Also, ∇×(∂B/∂t) = ∂(∇×B)/∂t
So we have: -∇²E + ∂(∇×B)/∂t = 0
From Ampère's Law: ∇×B = μ₀ε₀∂E/∂t
Substituting: -∇²E + ∂(μ₀ε₀∂E/∂t)/∂t = 0
Simplifying: -∇²E + μ₀ε₀∂²E/∂t² = 0
Or: ∇²E = μ₀ε₀∂²E/∂t²
This is a wave equation of the form: ∇²E = (1/c²)∂²E/∂t² where c = 1/√(μ₀ε₀)
Step 2: Similarly for the B field, taking the curl of Ampère's Law:
∇×(∇×B) - μ₀ε₀∇×(∂E/∂t) = 0
Using the vector identity: ∇×(∇×B) = ∇(∇·B) - ∇²B
Since ∇·B = 0 in vacuum, we get: ∇×(∇×B) = -∇²B
Also, ∇×(∂E/∂t) = ∂(∇×E)/∂t
So we have: -∇²B - μ₀ε₀∂(∇×E)/∂t = 0
From Faraday's Law: ∇×E = -∂B/∂t
Substituting: -∇²B - μ₀ε₀∂(-∂B/∂t)/∂t = 0
Simplifying: -∇²B + μ₀ε₀∂²B/∂t² = 0
Or: ∇²B = μ₀ε₀∂²B/∂t²
This is also a wave equation with the same speed c = 1/√(μ₀ε₀)
The wave equations for both E and B have the form:
∇²E = μ₀ε₀∂²E/∂t²
∇²B = μ₀ε₀∂²B/∂t²

Comparing with the standard wave equation ∇²ψ = (1/v²)∂²ψ/∂t², we can identify:
1/v² = μ₀ε₀
Therefore v = 1/√(μ₀ε₀) = c

Maxwell calculated this value using known values of μ₀ and ε₀, obtaining approximately 3.1×10⁸ m/s
This is within 3% of the modern value of c = 299,792,458 m/s
Additional properties of electromagnetic waves in vacuum:
1. From ∇·E = 0 and ∇·B = 0, we can show that E and B have no component in the direction of propagation
2. This means electromagnetic waves are transverse waves - they oscillate in a plane perpendicular to the direction of propagation
3. Furthermore, E and B are perpendicular to each other

Now I'll provide a complete final answer about the derivation of the wave equation from Maxwell's equations
