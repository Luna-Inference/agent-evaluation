I'll solve this task by walking through Euclid's proof that there are infinitely many prime numbers.                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I need to explain Euclid's classic proof that there are infinitely many prime numbers. This is a famous proof by contradiction that has stood the test of time for over 
2000 years. I'll walk through the steps of the proof clearly.

Euclid's Proof of the Infinitude of Primes:                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Step 1: Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that there are only finitely many primes.                                                                                         
Step 2: Let's say we can list all these primes as p₁, p₂, p₃, ..., pₙ.                                                                                                           
Step 3: Consider the number Q = (p₁ × p₂ × p₃ × ... × pₙ) + 1.                                                                                                                   
Step 4: This number Q must either be prime or not prime.                                                                                                                         
Step 5: If Q is prime, then we have found a prime not in our original list.                                                                                                      
Step 6: If Q is not prime, then it must have a prime factor p.                                                                                                                   
Step 7: This prime factor p cannot be any of the primes in our original list.                                                                                                    
Step 8: This is because Q gives remainder 1 when divided by any prime in our list.                                                                                               
Step 9: Therefore, we have found a prime not in our original list.                                                                                                               
Step 10: This contradicts our assumption that we listed all primes.                                                                                                              
Conclusion: There must be infinitely many primes.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Example:                                                                                                                                                                         
Suppose we have the list of primes: 2, 3, 5                                                                                                                                      
We form Q = (2 × 3 × 5) + 1 = 31                                                                                                                                                 
31 is prime and not in our original list                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Another example:                                                                                                                                                                 
Suppose we have the list of primes: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13                                                                                                                           
We form Q = (2 × 3 × 5 × 7 × 11 × 13) + 1 = 30031                                                                                                                                
30031 = 59 × 509 (where 59 and 509 are both prime)                                                                                                                               
Both 59 and 509 are primes not in our original list                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Euclid's proof that there are infinitely many prime numbers works by contradiction. Assume there are only finitely many primes, which we can list as p₁, p₂, ..., pₙ. Consider   
the number Q = (p₁ × p₂ × ... × pₙ) + 1. This number Q is either prime itself or has a prime factor. In either case, this new prime cannot be any of the original primes in our  
list since Q leaves remainder 1 when divided by any of them. This contradicts our assumption that we listed all primes, proving that there must be infinitely many primes.

Euclid's proof of the infinitude of prime numbers is one of the earliest and most elegant mathematical proofs in history. The proof proceeds by contradiction as follows:        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that there are only finitely many prime numbers, which we can list as p₁, p₂, p₃, ..., pₙ.                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. Consider the number Q = (p₁ × p₂ × p₃ × ... × pₙ) + 1, which is the product of all these primes plus 1.                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3. This number Q must either be prime or composite (not prime).                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
4. If Q is prime, then we have found a prime number that is not in our original list (since Q is larger than any prime in our list). This contradicts our assumption.            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
5. If Q is not prime, then by the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, it must have at least one prime factor, let's call it p.                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
6. This prime factor p cannot be any of the primes in our original list (p₁, p₂, ..., pₙ) because when we divide Q by any of these primes, we always get a remainder of 1. This  
is because Q = (p₁ × p₂ × ... × pₙ) + 1, so Q ≡ 1 (mod p_i) for any p_i in our list.                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
7. Therefore, p must be a prime number not in our original list, which contradicts our assumption that we listed all primes.                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thus, our initial assumption must be false, and there must be infinitely many prime numbers.                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
This proof can be demonstrated with examples. For instance:                                                                                                                      
- If we assume the only primes are 2, 3, and 5, then Q = (2 × 3 × 5) + 1 = 31, which is prime and not in our list.                                                               
- If we assume the only primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, then Q = (2 × 3 × 5 × 7 × 11 × 13) + 1 = 30031 = 59 × 509, where both 59 and 509 are primes not in our original list. 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
These examples illustrate how Euclid's method always leads to the discovery of new primes, confirming that the set of prime numbers is infinite.

  Q = (p₁ × p₂ × p₃ × ... × pₙ) + 1, which is the product of all these primes plus 1.\n\n3. This number Q must either be prime or composite (not prime).\n\n4. If Q is prime,    
  then we have found a prime number that is not in our original list (since Q is larger than any prime in our list). This contradicts our assumption.\n\n5. If Q is not prime,   
  then by the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, it must have at least one prime factor, let's call it p.\n\n6. This prime factor p cannot be any of the primes in our original  
  list (p₁, p₂, ..., pₙ) because when we divide Q by any of these primes, we always get a remainder of 1. This is because Q = (p₁ × p₂ × ... × pₙ) + 1, so Q ≡ 1 (mod p_i) for

Euclid's Proof of the Infinitude of Primes:

Step 1: Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that there are only finitely many primes.
Step 2: Let's say we can list all these primes as p₁, p₂, p₃, ..., pₙ.
Step 3: Consider the number Q = (p₁ × p₂ × p₃ × ... × pₙ) + 1.
Step 4: This number Q must either be prime or not prime.
Step 5: If Q is prime, then we have found a prime not in our original list.
Step 6: If Q is not prime, then it must have a prime factor p.
Step 7: This prime factor p cannot be any of the primes in our original list.
Step 8: This is because Q gives remainder 1 when divided by any prime in our list.
Step 9: Therefore, we have found a prime not in our original list.
Step 10: This contradicts our assumption that we listed all primes.
Conclusion: There must be infinitely many primes.

Example:
Suppose we have the list of primes: 2, 3, 5
We form Q = (2 × 3 × 5) + 1 = 31
31 is prime and not in our original list

Another example:
Suppose we have the list of primes: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13
We form Q = (2 × 3 × 5 × 7 × 11 × 13) + 1 = 30031
30031 = 59 × 509 (where 59 and 509 are both prime)
Both 59 and 509 are primes not in our original list

Out - Final answer: Euclid's proof that there are infinitely many prime numbers works by contradiction. Assume there are only finitely many primes, which we can list as p₁, p₂, 
..., pₙ. Consider the number Q = (p₁ × p₂ × ... × pₙ) + 1. This number Q is either prime itself or has a prime factor. In either case, this new prime cannot be any of the 
original primes in our list since Q leaves remainder 1 when divided by any of them. This contradicts our assumption that we listed all primes, proving that there must be 
infinitely many primes.
