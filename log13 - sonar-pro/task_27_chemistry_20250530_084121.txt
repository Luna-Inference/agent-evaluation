## Mechanism of SN2 Nucleophilic Substitution                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The SN2 (Substitution Nucleophilic Bimolecular) reaction is a one-step, concerted mechanism in which a nucleophile attacks an electrophilic carbon atom, resulting in the        
simultaneous displacement of a leaving group[2][3][4]. The term "bimolecular" refers to the fact that the rate-determining step depends on both the substrate (typically an alkyl
halide) and the nucleophile[2][5].                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
**Key Steps in the SN2 Mechanism:**                                                                                                                                              
- The nucleophile approaches the carbon atom from the side opposite to the leaving group (backside attack)[1][4][5].                                                             
- As the nucleophile begins to form a bond with the carbon, the bond between the carbon and the leaving group begins to break simultaneously[3][4][5].                           
- There is a single transition state where the carbon is partially bonded to both the nucleophile and the leaving group.                                                         
- The leaving group departs as the nucleophile completes its bond to the carbon, yielding the substitution product.                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
This concerted mechanism means that bond formation and bond breaking occur at the same time—there are no intermediates[3][4].                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
## Stereochemistry of the SN2 Product                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
SN2 reactions are highly stereospecific:                                                                                                                                         
- The nucleophile’s backside attack causes an *inversion of configuration* at the stereocenter (the carbon atom undergoing substitution)[2][4].                                  
- This inversion is commonly referred to as the "Walden inversion."                                                                                                              
- If the starting substrate is chiral, the configuration of the product will be the exact mirror image (opposite configuration) of the starting material[2][4].                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
> "The nucleophile attacks the stereocenter from the opposite side of the carbon-leaving group bond, resulting in inversion of stereochemical configuration in the product. Since

            ## Mechanism of SN2 Nucleophilic Substitution

The SN2 (Substitution Nucleophilic Bimolecular) reaction is a one-step, concerted mechanism in which a nucleophile attacks an electrophilic carbon atom, resulting in the 
simultaneous displacement of a leaving group[2\][3\][4\]. The term "bimolecular" refers to the fact that the rate-determining step depends on both the substrate (typically an 
alkyl halide) and the nucleophile[2\][5\].

**Key Steps in the SN2 Mechanism:**
- The nucleophile approaches the carbon atom from the side opposite to the leaving group (backside attack)[1\][4\][5\].
- As the nucleophile begins to form a bond with the carbon, the bond between the carbon and the leaving group begins to break simultaneously[3\][4\][5\].
- There is a single transition state where the carbon is partially bonded to both the nucleophile and the leaving group.
- The leaving group departs as the nucleophile completes its bond to the carbon, yielding the substitution product.

This concerted mechanism means that bond formation and bond breaking occur at the same time—there are no intermediates[3\][4\].

## Stereochemistry of the SN2 Product

SN2 reactions are highly stereospecific:
- The nucleophile’s backside attack causes an *inversion of configuration* at the stereocenter (the carbon atom undergoing substitution)[2\][4\].
- This inversion is commonly referred to as the "Walden inversion."
- If the starting substrate is chiral, the configuration of the product will be the exact mirror image (opposite configuration) of the starting material[2\][4\].

> "The nucleophile attacks the stereocenter from the opposite side of the carbon-leaving group bond, resulting in inversion of stereochemical configuration in the product. Since
purely SN2 reactions show 100% inversion in stereochemical configuration, these reactions occur through a backside attack"[4\].

## Conclusion

The SN2 mechanism involves a concerted, single-step process where the nucleophile attacks from the backside, displacing the leaving group and inverting the stereochemistry at 
the reaction center, resulting in a product with the opposite configuration from the starting material[2\][4\][5\].

Thought: The previous code block was correctly formatted as per instructions—it was explanatory comments within Python code to comply with the required code pattern. There is no
calculation or function; thus, the output "None" is expected because the code is only comments, which do not produce a runtime output or return value[5]. This is normal in      
Python: if you run a code block that doesn't include any executable statements or returns, the result is None[2][5]. To fully close the task, I will provide the final answer in 
the expected format.

Out - Final answer: The SN2 nucleophilic substitution is a one-step, concerted reaction where the nucleophile attacks the electrophilic carbon from the side opposite the leaving
group (backside attack). This results in the simultaneous formation of the new bond and breaking of the old bond, with no intermediates.

Stereochemistry: The SN2 mechanism causes inversion of configuration at the reaction center (Walden inversion). If the starting material is chiral, the product will have the 
opposite configuration.
