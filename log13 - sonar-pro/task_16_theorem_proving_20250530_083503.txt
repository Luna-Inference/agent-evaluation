I'll solve this step-by-step by developing a formal proof that the sum of two even numbers is always even.                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: To prove that the sum of two even numbers is always even, I need to use the definition of even numbers and show that their sum must also be even. I'll start by         
expressing even numbers in their mathematical form.

An even number can be expressed as 2k, where k is an integer.                                                                                                                    
This means any even number is divisible by 2 with no remainder.

I'll represent two arbitrary even numbers and calculate their sum.

To prove that the sum of two even numbers is always even, I'll use the algebraic definition of even numbers.                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, let's recall what makes a number even. An integer is even if and only if it can be expressed in the form 2k, where k is an integer. This means any even number is         
divisible by 2 with no remainder.                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now for the proof:                                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1) Let's call our two even numbers A and B.                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2) Since A is even, it can be written as A = 2n, where n is some integer.                                                                                                        
   Since B is even, it can be written as B = 2m, where m is some integer.                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3) The sum of these numbers is:                                                                                                                                                  
   A + B = 2n + 2m                                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
4) We can factor out the common factor of 2:                                                                                                                                     
   A + B = 2(n + m)                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
5) Since n and m are both integers, their sum (n + m) is also an integer.                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
6) Therefore, A + B = 2(n + m) is in the form 2k where k = n + m is an integer.                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
7) By definition, this means A + B is even.                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Therefore, the sum of two even numbers is always even.

To prove that the sum of two even numbers is always even, I'll use the algebraic definition of even numbers.                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, let's recall what makes a number even. An integer is even if and only if it can be expressed in the form 2k, where k is an integer[1][2]. This means any even number is   
divisible by 2 with no remainder[3].                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now for the proof:                                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1) Let's call our two even numbers A and B.                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2) Since A is even, it can be written as A = 2n, where n is some integer[4][5].                                                                                                  
   Since B is even, it can be written as B = 2m, where m is some integer.

   A + B = 2n + 2m                                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
4) We can factor out the common factor of 2:                                                                                                                                     
   A + B = 2(n + m)[5]                                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
5) Since n and m are both integers, their sum (n + m) is also an integer.                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
6) Therefore, A + B = 2(n + m) is in the form 2k where k = n + m is an integer.                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
7) By definition, this means A + B is even.                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Therefore, the sum of two even numbers is always even.

  To prove that the sum of two even numbers is always even, I'll use the algebraic definition of even numbers.                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  First, let's recall what makes a number even. An integer is even if and only if it can be expressed in the form 2k, where k is an integer. This means any even number is       
  divisible by 2 with no remainder.                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  Now for the proof:                                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  1) Let's call our two even numbers A and B.                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  2) Since A is even, it can be written as A = 2n, where n is some integer.                                                                                                      
     Since B is even, it can be written as B = 2m, where m is some integer.                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  3) The sum of these numbers is:                                                                                                                                                
     A + B = 2n + 2m                                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  4) We can factor out the common factor of 2:                                                                                                                                   
     A + B = 2(n + m)                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  5) Since n and m are both integers, their sum (n + m) is also an integer.                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  6) Therefore, A + B = 2(n + m) is in the form 2k where k = n + m is an integer.                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  7) By definition, this means A + B is even.                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  Therefore, the sum of two even numbers is always even.

Definition of even numbers:
An even number can be expressed as 2k, where k is an integer.
This means any even number is divisible by 2 with no remainder.
Example 1:
First even number A = 2 × 3 = 6
Second even number B = 2 × 4 = 8
Sum of A and B = 6 + 8 = 14
Sum can be written as 2 × (3 + 4) = 2 × 7 = 14
Is the sum divisible by 2? True

Example 2:
First even number A = 2 × -5 = -10
Second even number B = 2 × 2 = 4
Sum of A and B = -10 + 4 = -6
Sum can be written as 2 × (-5 + 2) = 2 × -3 = -6
Is the sum divisible by 2? True
Formal proof:
1. Let A and B be arbitrary even numbers.
2. By definition of even numbers:
   - A = 2n, where n is an integer
   - B = 2m, where m is an integer
3. Computing the sum: A + B = 2n + 2m
4. Factoring out the common factor: A + B = 2(n + m)
5. Since n and m are integers, (n + m) is also an integer.
6. Let's call this integer k = n + m
7. Then A + B = 2k, where k is an integer
8. By definition, A + B is even

Out - Final answer: 
To prove that the sum of two even numbers is always even, I'll use the algebraic definition of even numbers.

First, let's recall what makes a number even. An integer is even if and only if it can be expressed in the form 2k, where k is an integer. This means any even number is 
divisible by 2 with no remainder.

Now for the proof:

1) Let's call our two even numbers A and B.

2) Since A is even, it can be written as A = 2n, where n is some integer.
   Since B is even, it can be written as B = 2m, where m is some integer.

3) The sum of these numbers is:
   A + B = 2n + 2m

4) We can factor out the common factor of 2:
   A + B = 2(n + m)

5) Since n and m are both integers, their sum (n + m) is also an integer.

6) Therefore, A + B = 2(n + m) is in the form 2k where k = n + m is an integer.

7) By definition, this means A + B is even.

Therefore, the sum of two even numbers is always even.
