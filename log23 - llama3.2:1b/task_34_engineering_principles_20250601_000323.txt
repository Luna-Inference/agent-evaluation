[Ohm's law - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm's_law)
Ohm's law states that the electric current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two 
points. Introducing the constant of proportionality, the resistance, [1] one arrives at the three mathematical equations used to describe 
this relationship: [2] = = = where I is the current through the conductor, V is the voltage measured across the conductor ...
