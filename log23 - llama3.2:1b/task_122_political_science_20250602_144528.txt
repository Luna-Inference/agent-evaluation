A democracy is a type of government where power is held by the people. It has several key features:
- The majority of citizens have equal voting rights.
- Citizens can run for office and participate in decision-making processes.

Thought: I want to explain the difference between a democracy and a republic based on their characteristics.

Explanation:

A democracy is a type of government where power is held by the people, either directly or through elected representatives. In a democracy, the majority of citizens have equal voting rights, and citizens can run for office and participate in decision-making processes. The citizenry typically exercises its power through direct participation in elections, whereas in a republic, the system is more indirect.

A republic, on the other hand, is another type of government where power is held by the people, but not necessarily directly. In a republic, citizens are required to take an oath or swear allegiance to their country's constitution, which outlines the principles and values of the society. This implies that there may be some form of accountability to the citizenry, even if it's indirect.

Key differences:

*   **Direct vs. Indirect Power**: In a democracy, power is directly held by citizens, whereas in a republic, power is indirectly held through elected representatives.
*   **Voting Rights**: Democracies typically have equal voting rights for all citizens, while republics may require citizens to take an oath or swear allegiance to their country's constitution.
*   **Citizen Participation**: Democrats emphasize direct citizen participation, such as voting and public consultations. Republi-can governments often rely on representative democracy and less direct citizen involvement.

In summary, the main difference between a democracy and a republic lies in the system of power distribution, with democracies emphasizing direct citizen participation and republics relying on elected representatives.
