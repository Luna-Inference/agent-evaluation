Execution logs:
Protein folding issue in sickle cell anemia:
The abnormal beta-globin protein has a misfolded structure, which leads to the formation of aggregates and hemolysis.
The main protein affected is Hemoglobin S (HbS), which is produced by the mutation in HBB gene.
Properties of Hemoglobin S:
Molecular weight: 61 kDa
Ionization state: +1
Properties of Hemolysis:
Severity: Moderate
Symptoms: 1% of patients experience symptoms

Execution logs:
Protein folding issue in sickle cell anemia:
The abnormal beta-globin protein has a misfolded structure, which leads to the formation of aggregates and hemolysis.
The main protein affected is Hemoglobin S (HbS), which is produced by the mutation in HBB gene.
Properties of Hemoglobin S:
Molecular weight: 61 kDa
Ionization state: +1
Properties of Hemolysis:
Severity: Moderate
Symptoms: 1% of patients experience symptoms

Execution logs:
Protein folding issue in sickle cell anemia:
The abnormal beta-globin protein has a misfolded structure, which leads to the formation of aggregates and hemolysis.
The main protein affected is Hemoglobin S (HbS), which is produced by the mutation in HBB gene.
Properties of Hemoglobin S:
Molecular weight: 61 kDa
Ionization state: +1
Properties of Hemolysis:
Severity: Moderate
Symptoms: 1% of patients experience symptoms

Protein folding issue in sickle cell anemia:
The abnormal beta-globin protein has a misfolded structure, which leads to the formation of aggregates and hemolysis.
The main protein affected is Hemoglobin S (HbS), which is produced by the mutation in HBB gene.
Properties of Hemoglobin S:
Molecular weight: 61 kDa
Ionization state: +1
Properties of Hemolysis:
Severity: Moderate
Symptoms: 1% of patients experience symptoms

Execution logs:
Protein folding issue in sickle cell anemia:
The abnormal beta-globin protein has a misfolded structure, which leads to the formation of aggregates and hemolysis.
The main protein affected is Hemoglobin S (HbS), which is produced by the mutation in HBB gene.
Properties of Hemoglobin S:
Molecular weight: 61 kDa
Ionization state: +1
Properties of Hemolysis:
Severity: Moderate
Symptoms: 1% of patients experience symptoms

Execution logs:
Protein folding issue in sickle cell anemia:
The abnormal beta-globin protein has a misfolded structure, which leads to the formation of aggregates and hemolysis.
The main protein affected is Hemoglobin S (HbS), which is produced by the mutation in HBB gene.
Properties of Hemoglobin S:
Molecular weight: 61 kDa
Ionization state: +1
Properties of Hemolysis:
Severity: Moderate
Symptoms: 1% of patients experience symptoms

Out - Final answer: HbS has a molecular weight of 61 kDa, is +1 charged, and causes moderate hemolysis.
