I can provide a step-by-step plan to organize a surprise birthday party for 20 people within a $500 budget.

**Party Details:**

* Number of guests: 20
* Theme: Casual party
* Budget: $500

**Step 1: Determine the Venue (0% of budget)**

We'll use the backyard as the venue, which is free and easily accessible. This will save us a significant amount of money.

**Step 2: Plan the Logistics (10% of budget)**

* Food and drinks: We can allocate $126 for food and drinks, which should cover the basic needs of the party.
* Decorations and supplies: We'll need to allocate $100 for decorations and supplies. Since we're not planning any elaborate decorations, we can get by with a few balloons and some basic tablecloths.
* Entertainment: We'll need to allocate $154 for entertainment. This could be something as simple as playing music or having a DIY photo booth.

**Step 3: Plan the Food (30% of budget)**

Since we're not planning any elaborate food, let's focus on keeping it simple and affordable. We can consider ordering pizza or sandwiches from a local deli that offer catering services. This should cost around $100-$120 for 20 people.

**Step 4: Plan the Decorations (10% of budget)**

Since we've already allocated $100 for decorations, let's focus on making a few simple changes to enhance the party atmosphere. We can add some balloons and basic tablecloths to create a festive mood.

**Step 5: Plan the Entertainment (20% of budget)**

We'll need to allocate $154 for entertainment, which could be something as simple as playing music or having a DIY photo booth.

**Step 6: Finalize the Party Details**

* Date and time: Let's plan the party on a Saturday afternoon between 2 pm and 5 pm.
* Invitations: We can send out digital invitations via email or social media to keep costs low.
* Gifts: Since it's a surprise, we'll need to find creative ways to give gifts without revealing who they are. Perhaps we can bring a small gift for each guest to present during the party.

**Step 7: Execute the Party**

* Set up the backyard with balloons and basic decorations.
* Prepare the food and drinks according to our plan.
* Have some music or entertainment ready to go.
* Make sure all guests arrive on time and are aware of the surprise.
* Enjoy the party and celebrate the birthday person!

By following these steps, we should be able to create a fun and memorable surprise party for the 20 guests without breaking the bank.

Task 81 complete.
