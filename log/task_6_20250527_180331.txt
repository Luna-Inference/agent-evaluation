<think>                                                                           
Okay, the user wants to translate 'Good morning' to Spanish. Let me think about   
the tools I have. The available tools are web_search, visit_webpage, final_answer,
and others. Wait, the user mentioned that the assistant can use these tools, but  
the tools are not necessarily the same as in the examples. Let me check the tools 
again.                                                                            
                                                                                  
The tools are: web_search, visit_webpage, final_answer. The web_search function   
returns string results, and visit_webpage is for specific URLs. The final_answer  
is to output the answer.                                                          
                                                                                  
So, to translate 'Good morning' to Spanish, I need to use the web_search tool with
the query "translate Good morning to Spanish". But maybe the web_search tool can  
handle that. Alternatively, maybe the assistant can use the translator tool, but  
in the given tools, there's no translator function. The available tools are the   
ones mentioned.                                                                   
                                                                                  
Wait, in the previous examples, the assistant used the translator tool, but in    
this case, the tools available are web_search and visit_webpage. So maybe the     
assistant can use web_search with the query "translate Good morning to Spanish"   
and then process the result. However, the web_search returns the top results,     
which might be a string containing the translation. For example, if the search    
returns "Buenos días" as the translation, then the assistant can extract that.    
                                                                                  
But the assistant can't process the search results directly here. The assistant   
has to use the tools provided. So the code would be:                              
                                                                                  
Call web_search with the query "translate Good morning to Spanish", then check the
result. If the result contains the translation, then return it. But how to extract
the translation from the search results? The web_search returns a string, which   
might have the answer embedded. For example, if the search result is "Buenos      
días", then the assistant can take that as the answer.                            
                                                                                  
So the code would be:                                                             
                                                                                  
web_search("translate Good morning to Spanish")                                   
Then check the output. If the output is "Buenos días", then final_answer that.    
Otherwise, maybe the assistant has to process the result.                         
                                                                                  
But the assistant can't process the result directly; it has to use the tools. So  
the code would be:                                                                
                                                                                  
Code:                                                                             
```py                                                                             
translation = web_search(query="translate Good morning to Spanish")               
final_answer(translation)                                                         
```                                                                               
                                                                                  
But I need to make sure that the web_search returns the correct translation. If   
the search result is "Buenos días", then the answer is correct. Otherwise, maybe  
the assistant needs to adjust the query. But given the tools, this is the best    
approach.                                                                         
                                                                                  
So the final answer would be the translation from the web search.                 
</think>                                                                          
                                                                                  
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to translate "Good morning" to Spanish.   
Code:                                                                             
```py                                                                             
translation = web_search(query="translate Good morning to Spanish")               
final_answer(translation)                                                         
```
