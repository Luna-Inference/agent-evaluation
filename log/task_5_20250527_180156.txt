<think>                                                                                        
Okay, I need to list the first 5 prime numbers. Let's think about how to approach this.        
                                                                                               
First, I remember that a prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other    
than 1 and itself. The first few primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc. So the first five should be 2,
3, 5, 7, 11.                                                                                   
                                                                                               
But how to generate this programmatically? Maybe I can write a simple loop that checks each    
number starting from 2 upwards until I find five primes.                                       
                                                                                               
Let me think about the steps. Start with a counter at 2. For each number, check if it's prime. 
To check if a number is prime, I need a helper function. The helper function will check        
divisibility up to the square root of the number, which is efficient.                          
                                                                                               
So the plan is: iterate from 2 upwards, for each number, check if it's prime. If it is, add it 
to a list. Stop when the list has five elements.                                               
                                                                                               
Wait, but how to implement the prime check? Let's write a function is_prime(n) that returns    
True if n is prime. For n <= 1, return False. For n=2, return True. For n > 2, check           
divisibility from 2 up to sqrt(n). If any divisor is found, not prime.                         
                                                                                               
So the code steps would be:                                                                    
                                                                                               
1. Initialize a list to hold primes.                                                           
2. Start with number 2.                                                                        
3. While the list has less than 5 elements:                                                    
   a. Check if current number is prime.                                                        
   b. If yes, add to list.                                                                     
   c. Increment number.                                                                        
4. Return the list.                                                                            
                                                                                               
Let me code this. Let's start with the helper function.                                        
                                                                                               
Wait, but the user might want the code to be self-contained. So I can write the code in Python,
using the tools available. The tools here are web_search, visit_webpage, final_answer, etc. But
since the task is to list primes, maybe the code can be written directly.                      
                                                                                               
But the tools available are the ones mentioned. However, the user might not have the web search
tools here. Wait, the tools available are:                                                     
                                                                                               
- web_search (but not sure if it's used here)                                                  
- visit_webpage (but not needed here)                                                          
- final_answer (to output the answer)                                                          
                                                                                               
But the user wants the code to generate the first 5 primes. So perhaps the code can be written 
directly without using external tools, using standard Python functions.                        
                                                                                               
So the code would be:                                                                          
                                                                                               
Initialize a list, start with 2, check each number.                                            
                                                                                               
Let me write the code step by step.                                                            
                                                                                               
First, create a list to hold primes.                                                           
                                                                                               
primes = []                                                                                    
n = 2                                                                                          
while len(primes) < 5:                                                                         
    if is_prime(n):                                                                            
        primes.append(n)                                                                       
    n += 1                                                                                     
                                                                                               
Then, the first 5 primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11.                                                   
                                                                                               
So the code would be:                                                                          
                                                                                               
def is_prime(n):                                                                               
    if n <= 1:                                                                                 
        return False                                                                           
    if n == 2:                                                                                 
        return True                                                                            
    if n % 2 == 0:                                                                             
        return False                                                                           
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5)+1, 2):                                                       
        if n % i == 0:                                                                         
            return False                                                                       
    return True                                                                                
                                                                                               
primes = []                                                                                    
n = 2                                                                                          
while len(primes) < 5:                                                                         
    if is_prime(n):                                                                            
        primes.append(n)                                                                       
    n += 1                                                                                     
                                                                                               
final_answer(primes)                                                                           
                                                                                               
But wait, the user might not have the is_prime function available. However, the tools available
are the ones mentioned, but the user's code can use standard Python functions. So this code    
should work.                                                                                   
                                                                                               
But the problem is that the code needs to be written in the allowed tools. However, the tools  
here are not web search, etc. So the code can be written as a regular Python script.           
                                                                                               
Therefore, the code would be as above. Let me check if the code is correct.                    
                                                                                               
Testing the code:                                                                              
                                                                                               
For n=2, is_prime returns True. Add to primes. Then n=3, same. Then 4, not prime. 5, yes. 6,   
no. 7, yes. 8, no. 9, no. 10, no. So primes would be [2,3,5,7,11] when the loop stops. Wait,   
when len(primes) is 5, the loop stops. So the code would have primes as [2,3,5,7,11].          
                                                                                               
Yes. So the final answer is [2,3,5,7,11]. But the user wants the list, so the code would output
that.                                                                                          
                                                                                               
So the code is correct. Therefore, the final answer is the list of these primes.
