Okay, the user is asking who wrote "Pride and Prejudice". I need to figure out the answer. From
what I remember, it's a classic novel. Let me think... Oh right, Jane Austen wrote it. But     
wait, maybe I should verify this.                                                              
                                                                                               
I should use the web search tool to check the source of the book. Let me perform a search for  
the author of "Pride and Prejudice". The tool will return the top results. Then I can check the
first result to confirm the author.                                                            
                                                                                               
So the steps are: use web_search with the query "Pride and Prejudice author" and look at the   
first result. The answer should be Jane Austen.

Thought: I will use the web search tool to find the author of "Pride and Prejudice".
