Okay, the user is asking for the capital of France. I need to figure out how to get that       
information. Let me think about the tools available.                                           
                                                                                               
Hmm, the available tools are web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer. So maybe I can use   
web_search with the query "capital of France" to find the answer. Alternatively, maybe the wiki
tool could help, but the user didn't mention a wiki tool. Let me check the tools again. The    
tools listed are web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer. So web_search is the right choice
here.                                                                                          
                                                                                               
I should perform a web search for the capital of France. The query would be straightforward.   
Let me write the code for that. The code would call web_search with the query "capital of      
France". Then, once I get the results, I can extract the capital from the first result or the  
top result. Since the user expects a single answer, I'll assume the first result is the correct
one. Then, use final_answer to present the answer.                                             
</think>
