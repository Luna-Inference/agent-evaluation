<think>                                                                           
Okay, the user is asking for the speed of light. I need to find out the exact     
value. I remember that the speed of light in a vacuum is a fundamental constant.  
From what I've learned before, it's approximately 299,792 kilometers per second.  
But maybe I should verify this with a reliable source.                            
                                                                                  
Wait, the tools available include web search and wiki. So I can use the web_search
function to look up the exact value. Let me check the web search results. The top 
result might give the precise value. Once I get that, I can present it as the     
answer.                                                                           
</think>                                                                          
                                                                                  
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the exact speed of light.         
Code:

[Speed of light - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light)
The speed of light in vacuum, commonly denoted c, is a universal physical constant
exactly equal to 299,792,458 metres per second (approximately 300,000 kilometres 
per second; 186,000 miles per second; 671 million miles per hour). It is exact 
because, by international agreement, a metre is defined as the length of the path 
travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1 ⁄ 299 792 ...
