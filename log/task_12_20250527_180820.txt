<think>                                                                           
Okay, the user is asking who the first person to walk on the moon was. I need to  
find that information. Let me think about the tools available. The tools include  
web search, which I can use to look up the answer.                                
                                                                                  
First, I should perform a web search for the query "first person to walk on the   
moon". The web_search function can handle this. Once I get the results, I can     
extract the answer from the top results.                                          
                                                                                  
I remember that the answer is Neil Armstrong. But to be sure, I should check the  
search results. If the search returns multiple entries, I need to pick the one    
that mentions Neil Armstrong as the first person. The observation will show the   
results, and then I can finalize the answer.                                      
</think>                                                                          
                                                                                  
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the answer about the first person 
to walk on the moon.

<think>                                                                           
Okay, so the user asked, "Who was the first person to walk on the moon?" I used   
the web_search tool to find the answer. The search results listed several sources,
including Wikipedia and NASA pages. From the results, it's clear that Neil        
Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon. The Apollo 11 mission in 1969 
had him and Buzz Aldrin as the astronauts. The observation from the code didn't   
show any specific errors, so the search was successful.                           
                                                                                  
Now, I need to confirm the answer. The search results explicitly state that Neil  
Armstrong was the first. There's no conflicting information here. The code        
executed without errors, and the output included reliable sources like NASA's     
websites. Since the user's question is straightforward, the answer is Neil        
Armstrong. I should present this as the final answer.                             
</think>                                                                          
                                                                                  
The first person to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong. This conclusion is       
supported by multiple reliable sources, including NASA's official records and     
historical accounts from the Apollo 11 mission.
