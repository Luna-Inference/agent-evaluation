Okay, the user is asking for the capital city of Japan. I need to find that       
information. Let me think about the tools I have. The available tools are web     
search, visiting webpages, and final answer. Since the question is                
straightforward, I can use a web search to find the answer.                       
                                                                                  
First, I'll use the web_search function with the query "capital city of Japan".   
Then, I'll retrieve the results and extract the capital city from the top result. 
The capital of Japan is Tokyo, but I should confirm via the search to make sure   
there's no conflicting information. Once I get the result, I can use the          
final_answer tool to provide the answer.
