<think>                                                                           
Okay, the user is asking who painted the Mona Lisa. I need to find the answer     
using the tools available. Let me think about the steps.                          
                                                                                  
First, I should use the web search tool to look up the Mona Lisa's painter. The   
query should be straightforward. Let me check the tools again. The web_search     
function takes a query string. So I'll call web_search with "Who painted the Mona 
Lisa?".                                                                           
                                                                                  
Wait, the tools mentioned include web_search and visit_webpage. But the user might
want the answer directly. However, since the tools are limited, I have to proceed 
with the available options. The code would be something like:                     
                                                                                  
web_search("Who painted the Mona Lisa?")                                          
print("The answer is: ")                                                          
                                                                                  
But I need to make sure the search returns the correct information. If the search 
results mention Leonardo da Vinci, that's the answer. Otherwise, maybe there's a  
need to check another source. But according to the example given, the assistant   
uses the tools as needed. So I'll proceed with the web_search and then present the
answer.                                                                           
</think>                                                                          
                                                                                  
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the answer about who painted the  
Mona Lisa.                                                                        
Code:                                                                             
```py                                                                             
mona_lisa_painter = web_search(query="Who painted the Mona Lisa?")                
print("The answer is:", mona_lisa_painter)                                        
```
