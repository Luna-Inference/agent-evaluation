<think>                                                                                                    
Okay, the user is asking for the largest mammal. I need to figure out how to get this information. Let me  
think about the tools I have.                                                                              
                                                                                                           
The available tools are web_search and visit_webpage, which can be used to look up information. Also,      
there's the final_answer function to present the result.                                                   
                                                                                                           
First, I should perform a web search to find the largest mammal. The query should be straightforward. Maybe
something like "largest mammal" or "biggest mammal". I'll use the web_search function with that query.     
                                                                                                           
Once I get the search results, I need to parse them to find the answer. The results might include articles 
or lists mentioning the largest mammals. Common knowledge says the blue whale is the largest, but I should 
verify this through the search.                                                                            
                                                                                                           
Wait, the user might expect the answer to be the blue whale, but I should make sure the search confirms    
that. If the search returns multiple results, I need to extract the relevant information. For example, if  
the top result says "Blue whale is the largest mammal," then that's the answer.                            
                                                                                                           
Alternatively, if the search returns other mammals like the giraffe or elephant, I should check the data.  
But the blue whale is definitely the largest in terms of biomass. However, the question is about the       
largest mammal, which could be based on body size, weight, or length. The blue whale is the largest in     
terms of length and weight.                                                                                
                                                                                                           
So, I'll perform the web search, get the results, and then use the final_answer function with the          
determined answer. If the search results confirm the blue whale, that's the answer. If not, maybe there's a
different mammal. But I think the answer is the blue whale.                                                
</think>                                                                                                   
                                                                                                           
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the largest mammal and then use the final_answer function  
to present the result.
