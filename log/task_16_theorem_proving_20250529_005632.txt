Thought: To prove that the sum of two even numbers is always even, we start with the definition of even numbers. An even number can be    
expressed as 2 times an integer. Let the two even numbers be 2a and 2b, where a and b are any integers. Then, their sum is:               
                                                                                                                                          
  2a + 2b = 2(a + b).                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                          
Since (a + b) is also an integer, the sum is divisible by 2, which means 2a + 2b is even.

# Let a and b be arbitrary integers. Then two even numbers can be written as 2*a and 2*b.
