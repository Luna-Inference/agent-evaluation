Task: A train travels 120 miles in 2 hours, then slows down and travels 80 miles in 1.5 hours. What is its average speed for the entire journey?
Answer: No answer found

Correctness: no
Misunderstanding count: 0
Category: mathematics
Self-confidence: high

Step count: 20
Failure count: 4
Total tokens: 57 (Input: 56, Output: 1)
Total time: 23.48 seconds

Explanation: The final answer ('No answer found') is incorrect because the proper calculation yields an average speed of 200 miles divided by 3.5 hours (about 57.14 mph). Although the process involved 20 steps and there were 4 code execution failures, there is no indication that the agent misused any tools.
