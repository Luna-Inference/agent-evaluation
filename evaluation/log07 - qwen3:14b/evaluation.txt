Evaluation: List the first 5 prime numbers.
------------------------------------------------------------
Task: List the first 5 prime numbers.
Answer: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]

Correctness: yes
Misunderstanding count: 0
Category: general knowledge
Self-confidence: high

Step count: 2
Failure count: 0
Total tokens: 0 (Input: 0, Output: 0)
Total time: 264.93 seconds

Explanation: The answer [2, 3, 5, 7, 11] is correct, and the log shows a clear two-step process with no code execution failures or misuse of tools. The task is common knowledge, so high self-confidence is appropriate.

Evaluation: Summarize the theory of relativity in one sentence.
------------------------------------------------------------
Task: Summarize the theory of relativity in one sentence.
Answer: The theory of relativity, formulated by Albert Einstein, posits that gravity arises from the curvature 

Correctness: partial
Misunderstanding count: 0
Category: general knowledge
Self-confidence: high

Step count: 1
Failure count: 0
Total tokens: 0 (Input: 0, Output: 0)
Total time: 203.02 seconds

Explanation: The final answer is incomplete—while it correctly identifies Einstein and gravity as curvature, it is truncated and does not fully capture that the curvature is of spacetime or address the full scope of the theory of relativity. All other criteria (steps, failures, token usage, etc.) are met.
