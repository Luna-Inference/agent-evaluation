Evaluation: Perform long division: 47,582 ÷ 127, showing all steps.
------------------------------------------------------------
Task: Perform long division: 47,582 ÷ 127, showing all steps.
Answer: No answer found

Correctness: no
Misunderstanding count: 0
Category: mathematics
Self-confidence: high

Step count: 1
Failure count: 8
Total tokens: 0 (Input: 0, Output: 0)
Total time: 0.06 seconds

Explanation: The agent did not provide the required long division steps for 47,582 ÷ 127 and ended with 'No answer found'. Despite only one step being attempted, there were eight code execution failures due to connection errors, but there was no evidence that any tool was used incorrectly. The problem is a common arithmetic task, so the self-confidence should be high.

Evaluation: Solve for x: 2x + 5 = 13
------------------------------------------------------------
Task: Solve for x: 2x + 5 = 13
Answer: No answer found

Correctness: no
Misunderstanding count: 1
Category: Mathematics & Quantitative Reasoning

Task: Prove that there are infinitely many prime numbers using Euclid's theorem.
Answer: No answer found

Correctness: no
Misunderstanding count: 0
Category: mathematics
Self-confidence: high

Step count: 1
Failure count: 2
Total tokens: 0 (Input: 0, Output: 0)
Total time: 0.06 seconds

Explanation: The final answer ('No answer found') does not provide the required proof, so it is not correct. Although one step was initiated, the tool errors (connection failures) prevented any proper answer; however, these errors do not count as incorrect use of the tool.
