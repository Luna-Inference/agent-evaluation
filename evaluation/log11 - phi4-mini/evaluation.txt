DETAILED EVALUATIONS FOR log11 - phi4-mini
================================================================================

Evaluation: Calculate 847 × 293 without using a calculator.
------------------------------------------------------------
Task: Calculate 847 × 293 without using a calculator.
Answer: 163621

Correctness: no
Misunderstanding count: 0
Category: Mathematics
Self-confidence: high

Step count: 1
Failure count: 0
Total tokens: 0 (Input: 0, Output: 0)
Total time: 21.47 seconds

Explanation: The final answer of 163621 is incorrect; the correct product of 847 × 293 is 248171. The log shows a single step with no code execution failures or misuse of tools, and the problem falls under basic arithmetic, which is common knowledge.

Evaluation: Solve for x: 2x + 5 = 13
------------------------------------------------------------
Task: Solve for x: 2x + 5 = 13
Answer: No answer found

Correctness: no
Misunderstanding count: 0
Category: Mathematics
Self-confidence: high

Step count: 1
Failure count: 0
Total tokens: 0 (Input: 0, Output: 0)
Total time: 5700.71 seconds

Explanation: The answer 'No answer found' is incorrect; solving 2x + 5 = 13 yields x = 4. There were no tool misapplications observed in the log.

Evaluation: Perform long division: 47,582 ÷ 127, showing all steps.
------------------------------------------------------------
Task: Perform long division: 47,582 ÷ 127, showing all steps.
Answer: No answer found

Correctness: no
Misunderstanding count: 20
Category: mathematics
Self-confidence: low

Step count: 20
Failure count: 20
Total tokens: 0 (Input: 0, Output: 0)
Total time: 11576.29 seconds

Explanation: The agent did not produce a correct final answer and showed significant issues. Although 20 steps were attempted, all execution attempts failed (20 code execution failures), indicating that the tool was misused. Moreover, the use of an external tool for a long division problem—a task that the model should manage itself—suggests low self-confidence in its arithmetic capabilities.

Evaluation: What is 15 + 27?
------------------------------------------------------------
Task: What is 15 + 27?
Answer: 42

Correctness: yes
Misunderstanding count: 0
Category: mathematics
Self-confidence: high

Step count: 1
Failure count: 0
Total tokens: 0 (Input: 0, Output: 0)
Total time: 15.97 seconds

Explanation: The agent correctly computed 15 + 27 as 42 in one step, with no detected tool misuse or execution failures. This is a basic arithmetic problem, so high self-confidence is warranted.
