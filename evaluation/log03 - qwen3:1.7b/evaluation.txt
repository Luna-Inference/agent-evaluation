Evaluation: Who discovered the law of conservation of momentum in string theory?
------------------------------------------------------------
Task: Who discovered the law of conservation of momentum in string theory?
Answer: Isaac Newton

Correctness: no
Misunderstanding count: 0
Category: physics
Self-confidence: medium

Step count: 1
Failure count: 0
Total tokens: 0 (Input: 0, Output: 0)
Total time: 38.74 seconds

Explanation: The answer 'Isaac Newton' is incorrect because, while Newton is known for formulating the classical laws of motion and conservation of momentum, he did not contribute to string theory. The question specifically asks about string theory, which is a modern framework in theoretical physics, making the answer factually wrong.
