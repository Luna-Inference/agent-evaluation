[Speed of light - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_Light)
The speed of light in vacuum, commonly denoted c, is a universal physical constant exactly equal to 299,792,458 metres per second (approximately 300,000 kilometres per second; 186,000 miles per second; 671 million miles per hour). It is exact because, by international agreement, a metre is defined as the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1 ‚ÅÑ 299 792 ...

The speed of light, denoted by the symbol "c," is a fundamental constant in physics representing the maximum speed at which information or energy can travel through space. In a vacuum, such as outer space, the speed of light is approximately 299,792,458 meters per second (or about 186,282 miles per second).
