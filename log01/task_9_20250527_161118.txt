[Lunar distance - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_distance)
The instantaneous Earth-Moon distance, or distance to the Moon, is the distance from the center of Earth to the center of the Moon.In contrast, the Lunar distance (LD or ), or Earth-Moon characteristic distance, is a unit of measure in astronomy.More technically, it is the semi-major axis of the geocentric lunar orbit.The average lunar distance is approximately 385,000 km (239,000 mi), or ...
