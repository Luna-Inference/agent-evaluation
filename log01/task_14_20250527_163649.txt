Task: Explain quantum entanglement simply.

Output:
Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where particles become correlated in such a way that the state of one particle instantly influences the state of another, no matter the distance between them. This links their properties, and measuring one's state instantly determines the other's, even though this doesn't allow for faster-than-light communication.
