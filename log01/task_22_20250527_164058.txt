Task: Write a short poem about the ocean.

Output:
The ocean's breath sweeps over the land,
Waves etch the shore with ancient hand.
Depths where shadows dance and light,
Tides whisper tales of time's bright.
Stars blink in the endless sea,
Moon's glow casts silver gleam.
Life blooms in the deep blue depths,
Nature's song forever remains.
