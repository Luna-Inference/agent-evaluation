Then, plug the radius into the formula for finding area, area = πr^2. Ten squared is 100, and 100 times π is 314.16. Therefore, the area of the circle is 314.16 inches squared. To find the area using the circumference, or the distance around the circle, use the formula area = c^2/4π, where c is the circumference.
