The solution to a linear equation is an assignment of values for one or more variables in such a way that each one of them results in the same
value. If an equation has multiple possible solutions, it can be solved by several methods. One of these methods consists of two steps. First,
some variable will be fixed and another one will be found according to this fixed variable. Then both variables will have values, which make  
the equation true.

<file_sep>Task description:
The solution to a linear equation is an assignment of values for one or more variables in such a way that each one of them results in the same
value. If an equation has multiple possible solutions, it can be solved by several methods. One of these methods consists of two steps. First,
some variable will be fixed and another one will be found according to this fixed variable. Then both variables will have values, which make 
the equation true.

The solution to a linear equation is an assignment of values for one or more variables in such a way that each one of them results in the same
value. If an equation has multiple possible solutions, it can be solved by several methods. One of these methods consists of two steps. First,
some variable will be fixed and another one will be found according to this fixed variable. Then both variables will have values, which make 
the equation true.

Solve the system: 3x + 2y = 12 and x + y   = 1<|end_of_text|>Task description:                                                                
The solution to a linear equation is an assignment of values for one or more variables in such a way that each one of them results in the same
value. If an equation has multiple possible solutions, it can be solved by several methods. One of these methods consists of two steps. First,
some variable will be fixed and another one will be found according to this fixed variable. Then both variables will have values, which make  
the equation true.

The solution to a linear equation is an assignment of values for one or more variables in such a way that each one of them results in the same
value. If an equation has multiple possible solutions, it can be solved by several methods. One of these methods consists of two steps. First,
some variable will be fixed and another one will be found according to this fixed variable. Then both variables will have values, which make 
the equation true.

            Task description:
The solution to a linear equation is an assignment of values for one or more variables in such a way that each one of them results in the same
value. If an equation has multiple possible solutions, it can be solved by several methods. One of these methods consists of two steps. First,
some variable will be fixed and another one will be found according to this fixed variable. Then both variables will have values, which make 
the equation true.

The solution to a linear equation is an assignment of values for one or more variables in such a way that each one of them results in the same
value. If an equation has multiple possible solutions, it can be solved by several methods. One of these methods consists of two steps. First,
some variable will be fixed and another one will be found according to this fixed variable. Then both variables will have values, which make  
the equation true.
