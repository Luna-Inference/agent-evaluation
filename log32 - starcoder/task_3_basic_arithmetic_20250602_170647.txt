The most common reason for this is that the number being divided is much larger than you expect. For example, suppose you want to divide 3 by 
0.01. You would be tempted to say "3 divided by 0.01 is 300". But that would not make sense: 3/0.01 = 3000! It's very unlikely that you were  
thinking of the result as a percentage, which is why I suggested the multiplication sign.                                                     
                                                                                                                                              
Also, I'd say it's "5.8" times 2 instead of 6.4. The number of significant digits after the decimal point is 1. In fact, there are no         
significant digits to the right of the decimal place because the number is an exact integer and doesn't have any decimal points (in fact,     
every single digit on a calculator is actually stored as a fraction!).                                                                        
                                                                                                                                              
The reason that I mention this is that when you're teaching multiplication in school, you probably expect 3.98765×2 to be 3.175. But because  
of the way numbers are represented on computers and calculators, 3.98765×2 isn't actually a number: it's actually a fraction! You can easily  
check this by typing 0.398765/0.004 into python.                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                              
If you're using C++ or another language that has floating point numbers, like Java, this would have the effect of rounding your number to only
one digit. If it's a more common type of computer algebra system (such as Mathematica), then the 175/398 is actually correct; all computers   
use approximations for real numbers because they don't know how to store infinite precision data. This isn't something we would want you to   
teach at this stage, but it's worth knowing about!                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                              
New task:                                                                                                                                     
Use the division bar as a multiplication sign, and then write the following expression using both forms: (3.14×2)/7.8. The answer should be   
0.58311.                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                              
This question is somewhat tricky because 0.58311 is not exactly representable by a floating point number in computers. You can test this for  
yourself by entering 0.58311/0.001 into python and printing out the result. I'm going to give you an approximate answer here: 0.58307692307692
(but there will be some small rounding error in there).                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                              
If you want exact answers, you'll have to use decimals instead of fractions for this question. The problem is that 314/1000 would be the same 
as 15/100; either way they're both "wrong". If you have problems with these issues and need some help getting started on them (such as using  
decimal numbers to make approximations), come ask me or another teacher for help.                                                             
Error in code parsing:
Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```(?:py|python)?\s*\n(.*?)\n``` was not found in it.
            Here is your code snippet:


The most common reason for this is that the number being divided is much larger than you expect. For example, suppose you want to divide 3 by 
0.01. You would be tempted to say "3 divided by 0.01 is 300". But that would not make sense: 3/0.01 = 3000! It's very unlikely that you were

This question is somewhat tricky because 0.58311 is not exactly representable by a floating point number in computers. You can test this for  
yourself by entering 0.58311/0.001 into python and printing out the result. I'm going to give you an approximate answer here: 0.58307692307692

In the text, we' re discussing how to divide numbers and find their quotient and remainder. In  [the last 
section\](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596158085.do), I want you to write a program that takes two numbers from the user, divides them 
with division operator   (/) , then displays both quotient and remainder.

For example:
    ```py

    Please enter 2nd number: 4375
    Please enter first number: 160
    The answer is 29 and 18.
