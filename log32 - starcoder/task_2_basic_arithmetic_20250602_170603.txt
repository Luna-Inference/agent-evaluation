There is a solution that requires a little more than one line of code. I will show you both. But first, you must understand the basics before 
we can get started.                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                              
<file_sep>                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                              
## What do we need to do this?                                                                                                                
We are going to be creating a program that takes the input, 1234567890123456789 and turns it into 1,234,567,890.123,456. This is not difficult
to do but you will need to know how to work with strings.                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                              
- Convert 1234567890123456789 into "one hundred twenty three million forty five billion six hundred seventy eight million nine hundred ten    
thousand one hundred twenty three million four hundred fifty six billion seven hundred eighty nine million"                                   
- Make it pretty (Optional)                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                              
<file_sep>                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                              
## What do we need to do this?                                                                                                                
We will be using the following code:                                                                                                          
```                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                              
public static void main(String[] args){                                                                                                       
    System.out.println("hello world");                                                                                                        
}                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                              
```                                                                                                                                           
The first thing we want to do is get the input that the user types in. We do this with the Scanner class which is in java.util.scanner. For   
example, if you wanted 5 4 3, your code would look like:                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                              
<file_sep>                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                              
## What do we need to do this?                                                                                                                
To solve this problem you will have to use a for loop and some other mathematical formulas.<|end_of_text|>                                    
                                                                                                                                              
### Problem:                                                                                                                                  
```                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                              
Your program must take in two numbers. The first number is the number of rows. The second number                                              
is the number of columns. Then, print the following pattern:                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                              
The output would look like this: 1 2                                                                                                          
3 4                                                                                                                                           
5 6                                                                                                                                           
7 8                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                              
```                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                              
<file_sep>                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                              
## What do we need to do this?                                                                                                                
This problem is very similar to the previous one but requires a little more thinking about it. Try and think of a way to solve it without     
using any arrays.<|end_of_text|>                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                              
- The first line is the number of times you are going to print.                                                                               
- The second is the number of spaces at the beginning that will be printed (remember there can only be one space in front of each line).      
- The third is the number of spaces that should be between the numbers and the stars.                                                         
- The fourth is the maximum number that will be printed on a line.                                                                            
<file_sep>                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                              
## What do we need to do this?                                                                                                                
You are going to be using arrays for this problem! Firstly you must understand what an array is (if you don't understand, ask a tutor).       
Secondly, you must understand how you can print the elements of your arrays.<|end_of_text|>                                                   
                                                                                                                                              
This is a very basic program that will only take 5 inputs. This means each element in my array will be equal to one of these numbers. We then 
want our program to print out a 2D array that has 3 rows and 4 columns where each row is made up of the elements from above, starting at index
(0,0) going downwards.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                              
For example: 1 2 3 4 will make an array like so:

## What do we need to do this?                                                                                                                
This program will ask you for your name and then it will print that out back to you. We want the user's input to be echoed back after "Hello" 
                                                                                                                                              
- Read the user in and save as a variable.                                                                                                    
- Print hello followed by the users input.

We are going to be using arrays for this problem! Firstly you must understand what an array is (if you don't understand, ask a tutor).        
Secondly, you must understand how you can print the elements of your arrays.<|end_of_text|>                                                   
                                                                                                                                              
The objective of this program is to take in 5 inputs. We will store these numbers as elements in a one dimensional array. We then want our    
program to print out an 8 by 3 matrix that has each element from above. The pattern should look like this:                                    
                                                                                                                                              
<file_sep>

The first thing you have to understand is what arrays are. In Java, every array must be initialized with the number of elements when the array
is created (excluding primitive arrays). We are going to be using primitive arrays for this problem!<|end_of_text|>                           
                                                                                                                                              
You must read in 3 numbers and store them as elements in an array called "numbers". Then print out each element.

This is a very basic program that will only take one input. This means the first number you will be asked for will be equal to one of these   
numbers. We then want our program to print that number back to you. This is also a good chance to understand how to use if/else and read in   
numbers from the user.<|end_of_text|>                                                                                                         
- Read 1 input. If it's 3 or 7, print "Three" followed by an enter key. Otherwise print "Seven" then press enter.

The first thing you have to understand about this program is that you will be using 2 dimensional arrays. The second thing is that you must   
know how to use loops (for, while).<|end_of_text|>                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                              
This is a very basic program that will take in one input which is the size of each of the two arrays. Then for example if my user inputs an   
integer 3 then I should make an array with 5 rows and 2 columns.<|end_of_text|>

This is a very basic program that will ask the user for two inputs. The first input is the number of numbers you want printed and then the    
second one is the number of spaces between each number. Then it prints out 3 rows with 12 columns.                                            
- Read in 4 numbers. Print the 1st number, print an enter key. Repeat that many times.

## What do we need to do this?                                                                                                                
To solve this problem there are two main steps that must be done. These are 1) using the arrays in an appropriate manner and 2) printing out  
the elements. We want you to print out the elements from the first array, then the second one. This means that you must print out 3 of each   
element.                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                              
To print out 3 of every element is not difficult but it will require some thinking about what you are going to do.<|end_of_text|>

- Read in one input. If it's equal to 3, print "Three" on a new line followed by an enter key. Otherwise print "Seven", then press the enter 
key.

## What do we need to do this? 
We want our program to take inputs and print them out but we want to make sure that the input is an integer. You must use try/catch 
statements.<|end_of_text|>


            Make sure to include code with the correct pattern, for instance:
            Thoughts: Your thoughts
            Code:
            ```py
            # Your python code here
            ```<end_code>
Make sure to provide correct code blobs.

## What do we need to do this?                                                                                                                
To solve this problem there are two main steps that must be done. These are 1) using the arrays in an appropriate manner and 2) printing out  
the elements. We want you to print out the elements from the first array, then the second one. This means that you must print out 3 of each   
element.<|end_of_text|>                                                                                                                       
- Print the first row.                                                                                                                        
- Then after a new line, print the second row.

## What do we need to do this?
To solve this problem there are two main steps that must be done. These are 1) using the arrays in an appropriate manner and 2) printing out 
the elements. We want you to print out the elements from the first array, then the second one. This means that you must print out 3 of each 
element.<|end_of_text|>
- Print the first row.
- Then after a new line, print the second row.
- Then after another new line and continue printing until we reach the end of both arrays.

## What do we need to do this?


            Make sure to include code with the correct pattern, for instance:
            Thoughts: Your thoughts
            Code:
            ```py
             # Your python code here
            ```<end_of_text>
Make sure to provide correct code blobs.
Now let's retry: take care not to repeat previous errors! If you have retried several times, try a completely different approach.
