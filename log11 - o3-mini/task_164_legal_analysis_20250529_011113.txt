Thought: I will prepare a brief explanation delineating the differences between a contract and an agreement. A contract is a formal,      
legally binding agreement that, by its terms and conditions, is enforceable by law. An agreement, in contrast, refers to a broader range  
of arrangements between parties which may not necessarily have legal enforceability. While contracts include key elements such as offer,  
acceptance, and consideration, and are intended to create legal obligations, many agreements—such as casual understandings or informal    
arrangements—do not meet these criteria and therefore are not legally binding.                                                            
                                                                                                                                          
Code:                                                                                                                                     
```py                                                                                                                                     
final_answer("A contract is a legally binding agreement that includes essential elements like offer, acceptance, and consideration, and is
enforceable by law. In contrast, an agreement is a broader term for any mutual understanding between parties, which may not be intended or
legally enforceable. Thus, while every contract is an agreement, not every agreement qualifies as a contract.")                           
```

Out - Final answer: A contract is a legally binding agreement that includes essential elements like offer, acceptance, and consideration, 
and is enforceable by law. In contrast, an agreement is a broader term for any mutual understanding between parties, which may not be 
intended or legally enforceable. Thus, while every contract is an agreement, not every agreement qualifies as a contract.

Output:
A contract is a legally binding agreement that includes essential elements like offer, acceptance, and consideration, and is enforceable by law. In contrast, an agreement is a broader term for any mutual understanding between parties, which may not be intended or legally enforceable. Thus, while every contract is an agreement, not every agreement qualifies as a contract.
