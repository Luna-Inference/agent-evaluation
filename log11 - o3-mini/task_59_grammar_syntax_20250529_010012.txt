Thought: I'll explain that restrictive relative clauses provide essential information defining the noun they modify, meaning that without 
them, the meaning of the sentence changes or becomes unclear. In contrast, non-restrictive relative clauses add extra information about a 
noun whose identity is already clear, and they are usually set off by commas. I'll illustrate this using examples.                        
                                                                                                                                          
For instance, consider a restrictive relative clause in "The book that has a red cover is mine." Here, "that has a red cover" restricts   
which book is being talked about—without it, the listener might not know which book is mine.                                              
                                                                                                                                          
Now, consider a non-restrictive clause: "My friend, who lives in Paris, is visiting next week." In this sentence, "who lives in Paris"    
merely provides additional information about my friend and is not essential to identifying her.                                           
                                                                                                                                          
I'll now provide the final explanation as the answer.
