Thought: I'll write a Python code snippet that describes the molecular mechanisms of CRISPR-Cas9. I'll explain how Cas9 is guided by a    
single guide RNA to its target DNA sequence, the requirement for the PAM sequence, and mention the cleavage mechanism (by its RuvC and HNH
nuclease domains) and the subsequent DNA repair pathways (non-homologous end joining or homology-directed repair) that lead to gene       
editing.

Out - Final answer: CRISPR-Cas9 is a revolutionary gene editing technology that utilizes a programmable RNA to direct the Cas9 
endonuclease to a specific region of the DNA. The process begins with the design of a single guide RNA (sgRNA) that is complementary to 
the target DNA sequence. The Cas9 protein, once complexed with the sgRNA, scans the genome for a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), a short
DNA sequence crucial for target recognition. When the sgRNA binds to the target DNA adjacent to a PAM, Cas9 undergoes a conformational 
change activating its two nuclease domains: RuvC and HNH. These domains cleave both strands of the DNA, creating a double-strand break 
(DSB). Subsequently, the cell repairs the DSB through either error-prone non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or by homology-directed repair 
(HDR) if a donor template is available. This repair process can introduce insertions, deletions, or even precise modifications at the 
target site, thus enabling gene disruption or correction.
