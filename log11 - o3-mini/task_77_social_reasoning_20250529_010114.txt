Thought: I'll provide a concise explanation for why someone might avoid eye contact during a conversation. There are many possible reasons
such as social anxiety, shyness, cultural norms, or discomfort in social situations. Additionally, some people might avoid eye contact if 
they feel intimidated or guilty, or if they have a neurodevelopmental disorder like autism. I will now provide the final answer.          
                                                                                                                                          
Code:                                                                                                                                     
```py                                                                                                                                     
answer = "People might avoid eye contact for several reasons, such as social anxiety, shyness, cultural norms, discomfort, or even        
conditions like autism. It can also be a subconscious attempt to avoid confrontation or to lessen feelings of guilt or nervousness."
