Thought: In the multi-threaded banking application, the race condition likely occurs where multiple threads modify the shared account     
balance concurrently (for example, in the methods deposit or withdraw). The issue arises when the update (read-modify-write) to the       
balance is not synchronized, which can cause lost updates and incorrect balances. We can fix this by using a threading.Lock to ensure that
only one thread can modify the balance at a time. I will provide a revised version of the Account class that uses a lock to synchronize   
the deposit and withdrawal operations.

Thought: Since we are not allowed to import the threading module, I'll simulate a lock using the allowed module queue. A queue with       
maxsize 1 can act as a semaphore: when it's full, the lock is held, and when it's empty, the lock is available. I will define a custom    
Lock class that implements __enter__ and __exit__ so we can use it in a with-block to protect the critical section where the balance is   
updated. Then, I'll update the Account class to use this custom Lock in its deposit, withdraw, and get_balance methods. This prevents     
concurrent modifications from causing a race condition.

Error in code parsing:
Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```(?:py|python)?\s*\n(.*?)\n``` was not found in it.
                Here is your code snippet:
                Thought: Since we are not allowed to import the threading module, I'll simulate a lock using the allowed module queue. A 
queue with maxsize 1 can act as a semaphore: when it's full, the lock is held, and when it's empty, the lock is available. I will define a
custom Lock class that implements __enter__ and __exit__ so we can use it in a with-block to protect the critical section where the 
balance is updated. Then, I'll update the Account class to use this custom Lock in its deposit, withdraw, and get_balance methods. This 
prevents concurrent modifications from causing a race condition.

Code:
```py
import queue

# Custom lock using a queue as a semaphore (maxsize 1)
class Lock:
    def __init__(self):
        self.q = queue.Queue(maxsize=1)
        self.q.put(None)  # Initialize with one token

    def acquire(self):
        self.q.get()  # Blocks until a token is available

    def release(self):
        self.q.put(None)

Thought: I'll create a code snippet that fixes the race condition without using the disallowed threading module. Instead, I'll implement a
custom lock using the allowed module queue. This custom lock will use a queue with maxsize 1 acting as a semaphore. I will modify the     
Account class so that every access modifying the balance (deposit, withdraw, and get_balance) is wrapped in a with-block using this custom
lock. Finally, I'll include a simple simulation of interleaved operations (since we cannot properly simulate multiple threads without the 
threading module) that demonstrates that the balance remains correct.
