Thought: I will provide three plausible explanations for a scenario where a restaurant has a long line outside but appears empty inside.  
                                                                                                                                          
1. The restaurant could be using a reservation system or a first-come, first-served waiting list. Even though many people are waiting     
outside, the restaurant seats a few customers at a time. Once a table is free, the next party is immediately escorted inside, so at any   
given moment the interior may appear empty.                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                          
2. The restaurant might be in the process of a quick turnover. Diners are served rapidly and cleared out to make room for the next group, 
making it seem like no one is inside while a long line persists.                                                                          
                                                                                                                                          
3. The restaurant could be operating with a pre-order or take-out model. The long line outside represents people waiting to pick up their 
orders, while the interior is designated for staff operations or food preparation and thus appears empty.

```py

only a few are seated at a time.",
