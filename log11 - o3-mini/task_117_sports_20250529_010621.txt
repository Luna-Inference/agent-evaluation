Thought: I will now provide a detailed explanation of the evolution of analytics in baseball, covering historical developments, the rise  
of sabermetrics, and the changes it has contributed to player evaluation and game strategy. I will present a final answer using the       
final_answer tool.

final_answer("Analytics in baseball has evolved dramatically over the decades. In its early days, player evaluation was largely based on  
traditional statistics like batting average, RBIs, and wins, which provided only a surface-level view of performance. The advent of       
sabermetrics in the 1970s and 1980s—pioneered by analysts such as Bill James—challenged the traditional metrics by introducing more       
sophisticated statistics that aimed to quantify a player's overall contribution to wins. This led to the 'Moneyball' revolution in the    
early 2000s, where teams began to use data-driven approaches to identify undervalued players and optimize roster construction. Advanced   
metrics such as On-base Plus Slugging (OPS), Wins Above Replacement (WAR), and others have since become standard tools in assessing       
performance in ways that emphasize efficiency and overall impact rather than just traditional counting stats. On the strategic front,     
analytics have reshaped in-game decision making; for example, teams now deploy defensive shifts based on data about hitters’ tendencies,  
optimize pitching matchups and bullpen usage, and even leverage data for more informed in-game adjustments. Overall, modern analytics have
transformed both player evaluation and game strategy by providing a deeper, more nuanced understanding of the game, leading to competitive
