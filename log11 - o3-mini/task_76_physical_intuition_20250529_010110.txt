Thought: I will explain the phenomenon using the principle of conservation of angular momentum. When a figure skater pulls their arms     
close to their body during a spin, they reduce the distance of their mass from the axis of rotation. This reduces the skater's moment of  
inertia. Since angular momentum is conserved when no external torque acts, the decrease in moment of inertia must be accompanied by an    
increase in the angular velocity (rotation speed) to keep the angular momentum constant. This is why the skater spins faster when their   
arms are pulled inward.

Out - Final answer: When a figure skater pulls their arms in, they reduce their moment of inertia, which is a measure of how mass is 
distributed relative to the axis of rotation. Since the angular momentum of the skater is conserved (assuming no external torque), a 
decrease in moment of inertia leads to an increase in angular velocity, hence the skater spins faster.

Output:
When a figure skater pulls their arms in, they reduce their moment of inertia, which is a measure of how mass is distributed relative to the axis of rotation. Since the angular momentum of the skater is conserved (assuming no external torque), a decrease in moment of inertia leads to an increase in angular velocity, hence the skater spins faster.
