Thought: I will first perform a web search for the "current stock price of Apple" using the provided tool. Then I will perform another web
search to gather any recent significant changes or explanations regarding the stock price movement. Once I have both pieces of            
information, I will compile a final answer message that includes the current stock price and an explanation of any notable recent shifts.

Output message of the LLM: ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Thought: I will now compose a final answer that summarizes what we found from our web searches. The search results returned multiple      
authoritative sources (Yahoo Finance, MarketWatch, Nasdaq, etc.) where the current Apple stock price is available in real time. While the 
exact numerical price was not directly provided in the snippets, I can note that these sources are the best places to check for the       
precise value right now. In addition, several articles discuss significant recent changes in Apple's share price. These reports speak of a
record high jump on one day (around 7+% in a single day, linked to excellent Q1 earnings and robust iPhone upgrades) as well as a record  
one-day drop on another occasion. Analysts have revised price targets based on these earnings, changes in investor sentiment (including   
the impact of mechanical buying from index funds), and factors like mixed reactions to developments in artificial intelligence.           
                                                                                                                                          
Thus, the final answer explains that although the current number isn’t fixed in our search result snippet, the live price is available via
the above sources, and the significant changes have mostly been driven by strong earnings reports, shifting market sentiment, and external
factors affecting various investors.
