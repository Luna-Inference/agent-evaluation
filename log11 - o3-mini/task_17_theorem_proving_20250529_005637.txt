Thought: I will now provide a written proof by contradiction showing that √2 is irrational. The proof assumes initially that √2 is        
rational, meaning it can be expressed as a fraction in lowest terms, and then it deduces that both the numerator and denominator must be  
even, contradicting the assumption that the fraction is in lowest terms.

Out - Final answer: Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that √2 is rational. Then √2 can be expressed as a fraction a/b in its simplest
form, where a and b are integers with no common factors (other than 1), and b ≠ 0. Thus, we have: 
    √2 = a/b

Squaring both sides gives: 
    2 = a²/b²

Multiplying both sides by b² yields: 
    2b² = a²

This equation shows that a² is even (since it is equal to 2 times b²). If a² is even, then a must be even (because the square of an odd 
number is odd). So, let a = 2k for some integer k. 

Substitute a = 2k into the equation: 
    2b² = (2k)²
    2b² = 4k²

Divide both sides by 2: 
    b² = 2k²

This implies that b² is even, and therefore b must also be even. 

If both a and b are even, then they have a common factor of 2. This contradicts our initial assumption that a and b have no common factors
(i.e., the fraction is in simplest form). 

Hence, the assumption that √2 is rational leads to a contradiction. Therefore, √2 must be irrational.

Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that √2 is rational. Then √2 can be expressed as a fraction a/b in its simplest form, where a and b are integers with no common factors (other than 1), and b ≠ 0. Thus, we have: 
    √2 = a/b

Squaring both sides gives: 
    2 = a²/b²

Multiplying both sides by b² yields: 
    2b² = a²

This equation shows that a² is even (since it is equal to 2 times b²). If a² is even, then a must be even (because the square of an odd number is odd). So, let a = 2k for some integer k. 

Substitute a = 2k into the equation: 
    2b² = (2k)²
    2b² = 4k²

Divide both sides by 2: 
    b² = 2k²

This implies that b² is even, and therefore b must also be even. 

If both a and b are even, then they have a common factor of 2. This contradicts our initial assumption that a and b have no common factors (i.e., the fraction is in simplest form). 

Hence, the assumption that √2 is rational leads to a contradiction. Therefore, √2 must be irrational.
