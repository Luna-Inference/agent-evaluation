Thought: I will now provide an explanation of the differences between a democracy and a republic. In general, a democracy refers to a form
of government in which the power ultimately lies with the people, who directly participate in decision-making, such as through            
referendums. A republic, on the other hand, is a form of government where the people elect representatives who then make decisions and    
govern on their behalf. In essence, while all republics are democratic in that the people have a say in the government, not all           
democracies are structured as republics—a pure or direct democracy means that citizens directly decide on policies, without               
intermediaries.                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                          
Code:                                                                                                                                     
```py                                                                                                                                     
final_answer("A democracy is a system where the people directly participate in decision-making, often through direct voting on laws and   
policies. A republic is a system where the people elect representatives to make those decisions on their behalf. Thus, while both systems 
aim to represent the will of the people, a republic incorporates a layer of representation, reducing the direct participation of          
individuals in policy formation.")

Out - Final answer: A democracy is a system where the people directly participate in decision-making, often through direct voting on laws 
and policies. A republic is a system where the people elect representatives to make those decisions on their behalf. Thus, while both 
systems aim to represent the will of the people, a republic incorporates a layer of representation, reducing the direct participation of 
individuals in policy formation.

Output:
A democracy is a system where the people directly participate in decision-making, often through direct voting on laws and policies. A republic is a system where the people elect representatives to make those decisions on their behalf. Thus, while both systems aim to represent the will of the people, a republic incorporates a layer of representation, reducing the direct participation of individuals in policy formation.
