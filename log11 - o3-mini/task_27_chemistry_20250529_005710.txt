Thought: SN2 nucleophilic substitution occurs via a one-step, concerted mechanism. In this process, a nucleophile attacks the             
electrophilic carbon from the backside (i.e., the side opposite the leaving group). As the nucleophile bonds, the leaving group departs   
simultaneously. This backside attack leads to the formation of a pentacoordinate transition state, and the overall process causes the     
stereochemistry at the carbon center to invert (a phenomenon known as Walden inversion). This means that if the starting compound has a   
specific configuration (R or S), the resulting product will have the opposite configuration.

Out - Final answer: In SN2 nucleophilic substitution, the nucleophile attacks the electrophilic carbon from the backside, leading to a 
concerted transition state in which the lone pair forms a bond as the leaving group departs. This causes an inversion of configuration at 
the carbon center (Walden inversion), so the stereochemistry of the product is the mirror image (inverted) form of that in the substrate.

Output:
In SN2 nucleophilic substitution, the nucleophile attacks the electrophilic carbon from the backside, leading to a concerted transition state in which the lone pair forms a bond as the leaving group departs. This causes an inversion of configuration at the carbon center (Walden inversion), so the stereochemistry of the product is the mirror image (inverted) form of that in the substrate.
