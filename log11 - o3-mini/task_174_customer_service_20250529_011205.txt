Thought: I need to craft a professional and empathetic message that explains our refund policy regarding a partially used product, while  
showing understanding and willingness to help resolve the issue. I want to include the following elements: acknowledging the customer's   
feelings, explaining the policy, and offering potential alternatives, such as a partial refund, replacement, or store credit. I will then 
return this customer service message as the final answer.
