Thought: I will perform a web search for "main issues discussed at the most recent G7 summit" to help confirm the topics. Typically, the  
summit has focused on issues including economic challenges (inflation, recession risks), energy security, climate change, geopolitical    
tensions (notably regarding Russia and China), as well as security, digital challenges, and supply chain resilience. I'll now simulate the
answer based on relevant articles, then return the final answer using final_answer.
