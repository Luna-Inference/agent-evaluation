Thought: I'll outline a detailed step-by-step plan covering the essentials of organizing the surprise birthday party. The plan will       
include defining the budget and guest list, selecting and preparing a budget-friendly venue, sending digital invitations, planning        
affordable food and drinks, selecting inexpensive decorations, arranging entertainment, and coordinating the surprise logistics.

Step 1: Define the Basics                                                                                                                 
    - Guest list: 20 people.

Step 2: Select the Venue                                                                                                                  
    - Consider hosting the party at home or a friend's house to avoid venue rental fees.                                                  
    - Ensure the location has enough space for 20 people.                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                          
Step 3: Send Invitations                                                                                                                  
    - Use free digital invitation tools or messaging apps to invite guests.                                                               
    - Clearly mark the event as a surprise party and request discretion.                                                                  
                                                                                                                                          
Step 4: Plan the Menu                                                                                                                     
    - Opt for budget-friendly food options such as homemade finger foods, pasta dishes, or a DIY taco bar.                                
    - Allocate around $200 for food and drinks.                                                                                           
    - Purchase items in bulk from discount stores.                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                          
Step 5: Arrange Decorations                                                                                                               
    - Buy affordable decorations such as balloons, banners, and streamers from a dollar store.                                            
    - Allocate approximately $50-$75 for decorations.                                                                                     
    - Consider a theme that can be achieved with minimal purchases.                                                                       
                                                                                                                                          
Step 6: Organize Entertainment                                                                                                            
    - Create a music playlist using free streaming services.                                                                              
    - Plan party games and activities that require little to no cost.                                                                     
    - Reserve a small portion of the budget (~$50) for any necessary supplies.                                                            
                                                                                                                                          
Step 7: Coordinate the Surprise Element                                                                                                   
    - Plan the timeline so that all guests arrive before the guest of honor.                                                              
    - Assign a few trusted friends to help manage timings and distractions.                                                               
    - Decide on a signal to indicate when to start the surprise.                                                                          
                                                                                                                                          
Step 8: Allocate Remaining Budget                                                                                                         
    - Keep a contingency plan for unexpected expenses (approx. $50-$100 reserved).                                                        
    - Track all expenses to ensure the total does not exceed $500.                                                                        
                                                                                                                                          
Step 9: Task Assignment and Backup                                                                                                        
    - Delegate responsibilities such as food preparation, setup, and cleaning among a few helpers.                                        
    - Confirm roles and tasks with everyone involved ahead of time.                                                                       
                                                                                                                                          
Step 10: Final Check and Setup                                                                                                            
    - Confirm all details a day before the party.                                                                                         
    - Prepare a checklist for the day (food prep, decoration setup, music).                                                               
    - Enjoy the celebration and ensure the guest of honor is completely surprised!
