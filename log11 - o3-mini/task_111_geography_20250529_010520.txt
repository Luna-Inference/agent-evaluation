Thought: I will now provide a detailed explanation of how tectonic plate movements have shaped the geology and geography of the Himalayas 
in a clear and concise manner, summarizing the geological processes such as the collision between the Indian Plate and the Eurasian Plate,
the consequent uplift, mountain building, and seismic activity.

final_answer("The Himalayas were formed by the collision between the Indian Plate and the Eurasian Plate, a process that began about 50   
million years ago. As the Indian Plate moved northward and eventually collided with the Eurasian Plate, immense compressional forces were 
generated, crushing and uplifting the sedimentary and metamorphic rocks at the plate boundary. This collision not only built the towering 
peaks and deep valleys of the Himalayas but also led to extensive folding, faulting, and metamorphism in the region. The ongoing          
convergence of these plates continues to cause frequent earthquakes, making the Himalayas one of the most geologically active and dynamic 
regions on Earth. This tectonic activity has therefore been central in shaping both the geology (through uplift, folding, and seismic     
activity) and the geography (by creating the dramatic mountain ranges and associated landscapes) of the Himalayas.")
