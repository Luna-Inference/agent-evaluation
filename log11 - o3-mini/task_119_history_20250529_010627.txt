Thought: The task requires listing the main causes of the American Civil War. I know historically that this conflict was mainly caused by 
deeply rooted differences between the North and South, including slavery (both its moral and economic dimensions), debates over states'   
rights versus federal authority, economic and social differences, and disputes over the expansion of slavery into new states and          
territories. I will now return this as the final answer.
