Thought: I will now explain the molecular basis of sickle cell anemia along with its clinical manifestations in a comprehensive answer.   
Sickle cell anemia is caused by a point mutation in the gene responsible for the production of the β-globin chain of hemoglobin. This     
single nucleotide change leads to a substitution of the amino acid glutamic acid with valine at position six (E6V). The presence of valine
instead of glutamic acid creates an abnormal hemoglobin variant known as hemoglobin S (HbS). Under conditions of low oxygen, HbS          
polymerizes, causing red blood cells to adopt a rigid, crescent or “sickle” shape. This sickling process impairs the cells’ flexibility,  
leading to occlusion of small blood vessels, hemolysis, and subsequent anemia.                                                            
                                                                                                                                          
Clinically, patients with sickle cell anemia commonly experience:                                                                         
- Chronic hemolytic anemia, which results from the rapid destruction of the misshapen red blood cells.                                    
- Vaso-occlusive crises, which lead to episodes of severe pain and tissue ischemia.                                                       
- Increased susceptibility to infections due to functional asplenia.                                                                      
- Organ damage over time, affecting the spleen, lungs, kidneys, and other organs due to repeated episodes of ischemia and infarction.
