Thought: I need to translate a German poem into English while preserving its meter, rhyme scheme, and literary meaning. Lacking an        
explicit poem text in your request, I will assume you meant the well‐known poem “Der Erlkönig” by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. (If you     
meant a different poem, please let me know.)                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                          
I will now provide a translation of Goethe’s “Der Erlkönig” into English that attempts to preserve its metric flow, rhyme scheme, and     
poetic atmosphere.
