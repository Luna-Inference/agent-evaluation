Thought: I will produce a detailed causal chain explanation that connects deforestation to climate change. I will outline the process:    
deforestation removes trees that act as carbon sinks; this leads to reduced carbon dioxide absorption and increases atmospheric CO2       
levels. Additionally, the act of deforestation—often involving burning—releases more CO2. The elevated greenhouse gases then increase the 
greenhouse effect, trapping more heat in the atmosphere and causing global warming. I'll use the final_answer tool to present this final  
explanation.

Out - Final answer: Deforestation sets off a chain reaction leading to climate change: When trees are cut or burned, the natural 'carbon 
sinks' that normally absorb CO2 during photosynthesis are lost, reducing the Earth's capacity to capture greenhouse gases. At the same 
time, the act of deforestation—particularly when it involves burning biomass—directly releases stored carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. 
This increase in CO2 amplifies the greenhouse effect, trapping more heat and raising the Earth's temperature. Furthermore, the loss of 
forests affects local water cycles and biodiversity, which can further disrupt weather patterns and contribute to ongoing climate change.
