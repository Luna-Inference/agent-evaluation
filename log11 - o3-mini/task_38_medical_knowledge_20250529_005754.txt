Thought: I will now generate a detailed explanation discussing how Type 2 diabetes mellitus develops. Type 2 diabetes is primarily        
characterized by insulin resistance in peripheral tissues—such as muscle, adipose tissue, and liver—which impairs the ability of those    
tissues to respond to insulin properly. Over time, the pancreatic beta cells try to compensate by increasing insulin secretion, but       
eventually these cells become dysfunctional, leading to relative insulin deficiency. Chronic insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction 
contribute to elevated blood glucose levels and the metabolic abnormalities seen in Type 2 diabetes. Additionally, obesity, particularly  
visceral adiposity, produces inflammatory mediators that exacerbate insulin resistance, and genetic factors also interplay in the         
disease's development.

Out - Final answer: Type 2 diabetes mellitus is primarily characterized by insulin resistance in peripheral tissues like muscle, liver, 
and adipose tissue. This resistance means that cells do not respond effectively to insulin, forcing the pancreas to produce more insulin 
to maintain normal blood glucose levels. Over time, the prolonged demand leads to beta-cell dysfunction and a relative insulin deficiency.
The combination of insulin resistance, impaired insulin secretion, and often an inflammatory state driven by excess adiposity leads to the
chronic hyperglycemia seen in Type 2 diabetes. Additionally, genetic predisposition and lifestyle factors such as sedentary behavior and 
high caloric intake play significant roles in the pathophysiology of the disease.
