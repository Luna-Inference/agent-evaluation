Thought: I will simulate a research process by using the web_search tool to gather some details on renewable energy policies and recent   
legislative changes for five countries. Based on common knowledge and available information, I will compile a comparative analysis        
focusing on Germany, USA, China, India, and Brazil. I will include points on policy goals, incentives, regulatory frameworks, and recent  
legislative updates in each country.

   - Policy Overview: Brazil’s renewable strategy benefits from abundant natural resources, particularly in hydropower, and is            
diversifying into wind and solar.                                                                                                         
   - Recent Legislative Changes: Recent regulatory updates have streamlined permitting processes for renewable projects and introduced    
mechanisms to attract private investments.                                                                                                
   - Key Incentives: Long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs), auction systems, and supportive financing models.                        
   - Challenges: Balancing hydropower dependency with diversification into more variable renewable sources, and addressing bureaucratic   
challenges.                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                          
Conclusion:                                                                                                                               
These five countries illustrate varied approaches to renewable energy policy. Developed economies like Germany and the USA focus on       
restructuring and incentivizing new market entrants, while emerging economies such as China and India emphasize rapid expansion and       
large-scale infrastructure development. Brazil maintains a strong hydropower legacy while moving to diversify its renewable mix. Recent   
legislative changes across these regions indicate a global trend toward modernizing energy policies to foster sustainable development and 
address climate change challenges.
