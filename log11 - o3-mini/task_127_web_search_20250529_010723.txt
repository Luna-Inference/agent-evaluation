Thought: The task is to search for the opening hours of the "nearest library". However, the phrase "nearest library" is ambiguous since no
location is provided. I will use the web_search tool to see if there is any common resource or default answer related to "opening hours of
the nearest library". In case we don't get a specific result, I'll note that the answer depends on the location and ask for clarification.

Thought: The search results returned several library locations in the Palm Beach County area. Without a specific location from the user,  
“nearest” is ambiguous. However, one of the results appears to be the Mandel Public Library of West Palm Beach, which is often considered 
a central branch in that region. Its opening hours, according to an available snippet, are detailed on one site as follows:               
• Mondays and Wednesdays: 9:30 AM to 8:30 PM                                                                                              
• Tuesdays and Thursdays: 9:30 AM to 7:00 PM                                                                                              
• Fridays and Saturdays: 9:30 AM to 5:00 PM                                                                                               
• Sundays: 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                          
I will now provide a final answer with these details, while noting that the actual “nearest library” could differ depending on the        
caller’s location and that hours may vary by branch or change over time.
