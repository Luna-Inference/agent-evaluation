Thought: To answer the question, I'll consider typical reasons why someone might become distant and provide a thoughtful analysis. It     
could be that your friend is dealing with personal issues, experiencing stress, feeling overwhelmed, or simply needing some space.        
Alternatively, the change could be due to miscommunication or a shift in their feelings. I will now return the analysis using the         
final_answer tool.

their feelings, or could be experiencing changes in their life that are affecting their behavior. It's also possible that miscommunication
