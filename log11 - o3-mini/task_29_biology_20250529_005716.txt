Out - Final answer: Cellular respiration is the process by which cells convert biochemical energy from nutrients, typically glucose, into 
adenosine triphosphate (ATP), while releasing waste products. This process occurs in three main stages:

1. Glycolysis: This stage takes place in the cytoplasm, where one molecule of glucose is broken down into two molecules of pyruvate. In 
the process, a net gain of 2 ATP molecules and 2 NADH molecules is generated. Glycolysis does not require oxygen, so it is considered an 
anaerobic process.

2. Krebs Cycle (Citric Acid Cycle): Occurring in the mitochondrial matrix, the pyruvate from glycolysis is further oxidized. During this 
cycle, each pyruvate is converted into acetyl-CoA and then oxidized, resulting in the production of electron carriers such as NADH and 
FADH2, as well as a small amount of ATP and release of carbon dioxide as a byproduct. This stage requires oxygen indirectly, as it 
provides the conditions necessary for later stages.

3. Electron Transport Chain (ETC) and Oxidative Phosphorylation: This stage takes place across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Electrons
from NADH and FADH2 are passed along a series of protein complexes within the chain. The energy from these electrons is used to pump 
protons into the intermembrane space, creating a proton gradient. Finally, the flow of protons back into the mitochondrial matrix through 
ATP synthase drives the synthesis of a large amount of ATP. Oxygen serves as the final electron acceptor, forming water in the process.

Together, these stages enable the cell to efficiently extract energy from nutrients, with glycolysis providing a quick energy boost, the 
Krebs cycle offering intermediate electron carriers, and the electron transport chain generating the majority of ATP needed for cellular 
functions.
