Thought: I'll start by defining a specific location (for example, "New York City") and then simulate using multiple APIs to fetch current 
weather conditions, forecast over the next few days, and historical weather comparisons. I'll use the web_search tool to simulate each API
call separately, printing their outputs in each step, and then I'll combine the information into a comprehensive weather report.

Thought: Having fetched the current conditions for New York City, I now want to supplement that with a forecast and some historical       
weather comparisons. I will simulate two more API calls using the web_search tool—one for the 5-day forecast and one for historical data
