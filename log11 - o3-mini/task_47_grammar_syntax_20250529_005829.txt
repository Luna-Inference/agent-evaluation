Thought: I will begin by parsing the sentence “Although he knew that the project, which had been delayed multiple times, would require    
extensive revisions, he remained optimistic about meeting the deadline.” First, I will identify the main clause and then isolate any      
subordinate clauses.                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                          
The main clause is: “he remained optimistic about meeting the deadline.”                                                                  
                                                                                                                                          
Now, identifying the subordinate clauses:                                                                                                 
1. The sentence begins with a concessive subordinate clause introduced by “Although”. The entire clause is “Although he knew that the     
project, which had been delayed multiple times, would require extensive revisions”. This is an adverbial clause modifying the main clause.
2. Within that concessive clause, we have an object clause functioning as the complement of “knew”: “that the project, which had been     
delayed multiple times, would require extensive revisions.”                                                                               
3. Finally, within the object clause, there is a relative clause modifying “the project”: “which had been delayed multiple times.”        
                                                                                                                                          
Thus, the subordinate clauses are:                                                                                                        
1. “Although he knew that the project, which had been delayed multiple times, would require extensive revisions.”                         
2. “that the project, which had been delayed multiple times, would require extensive revisions.”                                          
3. “which had been delayed multiple times.”
