Out - Final answer: The last person on Earth sat alone in a room. There was a knock on the door. A tremor of disbelief surged through 
Avery’s heart as the echo of an unexpected visitor reverberated in the silence that had reigned for so long. For years, the empty 
corridors and abandoned streets had spoken volumes about a world that once buzzed with life, yet now lay mute under the weight of 
solitude. Avery hesitated, wary yet compelled by a lingering ember of hope. With cautious steps, Avery approached the door, each footfall 
reverberating through a cavern of memories. The knock came again—firm yet gentle—as if insisting that life was not yet finished. The room,
littered with relics of a bygone era, now bore witness to this small, yet profound intrusion. 

In a moment of resolve forged from countless nights of loneliness, Avery unlocked the door to reveal not a specter, but a traveler—barely 
more than a shadow, wearing the dust of uncountable journeys. The stranger’s eyes, glimmering with a silent story, met Avery’s gaze, and 
in that silent communion, decades of isolation crumbled. 'I’ve been searching for you,' the traveler whispered, voice faint yet 
determined, as if the cosmos had conspired to bring them together. 

Avery stepped aside, allowing the visitor into the modest room that had become a sanctuary of memory. As the hours passed, the pair

wildflowers still bloomed and where the songs of birds echoed in the mist of early dawn. Avery, in turn, unveiled memories of a bustling 
world now transformed into an echo chamber of solitude. Together they pieced together the narrative of humanity’s sudden disappearance,
