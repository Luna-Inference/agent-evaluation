Thought: I will now write a code snippet that explains what a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio) tells investors about a stock. This     
explanation highlights that the P/E ratio measures the amount investors are willing to pay for each dollar of a company's earnings. It can
indicate expectations of growth or potential overvaluation/undervaluation compared to its earnings.

earnings growth in the future, or it might suggest that the stock is overvalued. Conversely, a low P/E ratio can imply that the stock is  
undervalued or that the company may be facing challenges. Investors use the P/E ratio to compare valuation levels across companies and

dividing the current market price of a stock by its earnings per share (EPS). A high P/E ratio may indicate that the market expects higher
earnings growth in the future, or it might suggest that the stock is overvalued. Conversely, a low P/E ratio can imply that the stock is
