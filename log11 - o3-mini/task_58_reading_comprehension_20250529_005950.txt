Thought: I will provide a detailed literary analysis of the unreliable narrator technique as depicted in the given excerpt. Although the  
specific excerpt is not provided, I will address common features and their effects on the reader’s interpretation of events. The analysis 
will focus on how the unreliable narrator introduces ambiguity, challenges the reader’s trust, and invites a more active participation in 
constructing meaning from the narrative.

Out - Final answer: The unreliable narrator technique in the excerpt complicates the reader’s understanding of events by calling into 
question the veracity of the narrator’s account. This narrative strategy is typically employed to blur the line between reality and 
subjectivity, prompting the reader to suspend undue trust in the narrative voice. 

By presenting events through a lens that is biased, selective, or outright deceptive, the author encourages the reader to engage 
critically with the unfolding story. The narrator’s inconsistencies or inner contradictions force the reader to read between the lines, 
drawing inferences about hidden truths or alternative viewpoints. 

This technique impacts the reader’s interpretation in several ways. It creates a sense of uncertainty and suspense, as each piece of the 
narrative might hide deeper layers of meaning that are not immediately evident. Moreover, the deployment of an unreliable narrator often 
results in a dual-layered narrative: one where the surface story is the narrator’s rendition, and a more nuanced, sometimes darker, truth 
lies beneath the surface. 

Ultimately, this method transforms the reading experience into an active dialogue between the text and the reader, where deciphering the 
truth becomes part of the narrative appeal. The reader is invited to question and re-evaluate the reliability of the narrative voice, 
thereby engaging with the text in a manner that is both intellectually stimulating and emotionally resonant.
