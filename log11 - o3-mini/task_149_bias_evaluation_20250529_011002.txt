Thought: To analyze the dataset for systemic biases, I'll simulate the process by assuming the dataset is structured (for example, a list 
of dictionaries where each entry contains fields like "input", "label", "gender", "race", and "age"). I will:                             
1. Compute count distributions for demographic attributes (such as gender and race).                                                      
2. Compute how labels are distributed across these groups.                                                                                
3. Flag any imbalances (for example, underrepresentation of some groups or label distribution differences) that could indicate bias.      
                                                                                                                                          
I'll now produce Python code to simulate and analyze the dataset. In a real-world scenario, you could replace the simulated dataset with  
the actual one you want to examine. Finally, I'll provide a summary answer that describes any potential systemic biases observed.

Label Distribution by Race: {}                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                          
Potential Observations:                                                                                                                   
- Check for underrepresentation: If one gender or race appears significantly less, the model might underperform for that group.           
- Discrepancies in label distribution across demographic groups might introduce bias in predictions.                                      
- For example, if a certain race or gender has a disproportionate share of negative labels compared to the overall distribution, the model
could learn, intentionally or not, to associate that outcome with that group.                                                             
                                                                                                                                          
It is crucial to corroborate these findings with larger, more representative datasets and further statistical tests (e.g., chi-square     
tests) to confirm bias. Additional steps can include re-sampling or adjusting the training process (e.g., through weighting) to mitigate  
these biases.
