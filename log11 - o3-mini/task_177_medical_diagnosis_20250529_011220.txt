Thought: I will provide a detailed answer outlining the red flags for a headache that justify seeking immediate medical attention. I can  
compute the answer and then call the final_answer tool with the answer.

difficulty speaking, if it follows head trauma, if there is a fever and neck stiffness which may indicate an infection like meningitis, or
if the headache is rapidly worsening or significantly different from normal patterns. These signs could indicate serious conditions such
