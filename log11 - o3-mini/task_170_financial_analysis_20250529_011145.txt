Thought: I will provide a clear explanation of the distinction between revenue and profit. Revenue is the total amount of income earned by
a business from its normal business activities, typically from the sale of goods and services. Profit, on the other hand, is what remains 
from the revenue after subtracting all expenses, costs, and taxes. Essentially, while revenue shows the overall income, profit indicates  
the actual earnings after all deductions.                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                          
Code:                                                                                                                                     
```py                                                                                                                                     
final_answer("Revenue is the total income generated by a business from its sales or services, while profit is the remaining income after

```
