Thought: I will now provide a written proof of Euclid's theorem stating that there are infinitely many primes. The proof is as follows:   
                                                                                                                                          
Assume that there are only finitely many prime numbers: p₁, p₂, …, pₙ. Consider the number Q = p₁ · p₂ · … · pₙ + 1. Notice that Q is not 
divisible by any of the primes in our finite list because dividing Q by any prime pᵢ gives a remainder of 1. Therefore, Q is either prime 
itself or has a prime factor that is not in our list. In either case, we reach a contradiction to our assumption that we had listed all   
the primes. Hence, there must be infinitely many prime numbers.

Out - Final answer: Assume there are finitely many primes: p1, p2, ..., pn.
Consider the number Q = p1 * p2 * ... * pn + 1.
Notice that Q is not divisible by any of the primes in our list since Q mod pi = 1 for each i.
Thus, Q must either be prime or have a prime divisor not in our list, which contradicts the assumption that we have listed all primes.
Therefore, there must be infinitely many prime numbers.

Output:
Assume there are finitely many primes: p1, p2, ..., pn.
Consider the number Q = p1 * p2 * ... * pn + 1.
Notice that Q is not divisible by any of the primes in our list since Q mod pi = 1 for each i.
Thus, Q must either be prime or have a prime divisor not in our list, which contradicts the assumption that we have listed all primes.
