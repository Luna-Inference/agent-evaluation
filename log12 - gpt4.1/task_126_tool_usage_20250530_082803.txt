Thought: To create a comprehensive weather report for a given location, I need to obtain current weather conditions, a weather forecast, and some historical weather data to     
provide meaningful comparisons. Since I do not have access to weather-specific APIs, I will use web_search to get relevant data for each of these items. Let's start by defining 
the location for which to generate the report, and then search for each component separately: current weather, forecast, and historical comparison.                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I'll assume a location—let's use "New York" as an example. I'll search for the current weather conditions in New York.

Thought: I now have a list of reliable sources for current weather conditions in New York (such as AccuWeather, National Weather Service, Weather Channel, etc.). To get accurate
details, I'll visit "AccuWeather" for current conditions, and then for the forecast I'll visit the National Weather Service (NOAA) link. Afterwards, I'll search and visit a     
reputable source for historical weather data.

Thought: From the NOAA webpage, I was able to extract current weather conditions (overcast, 64°F, 84% humidity, calm wind, 29.78 in barometer, dewpoint 59°F, 8 mi visibility),  
plus a detailed multiday forecast: today through Thursday, including temperature ranges and precipitation probabilities. The next step is to get historical weather data for New 
York around this date, to make comparisons (e.g., temperature vs same day last year or historical averages).                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I will now do a web search for "historical weather in New York on May 30" to obtain this info.

Thought: The search produced several promising sources for historical weather data: Extreme Weather Watch, Weather Underground, and Weather Spark. I should visit one to get     
actual historical highs/lows for May 30 in New York, as well as typical climate averages for this date. I'll visit the Weather Underground historical daily page, which should   
allow me to view detailed past weather.
