Thought: I am being asked to write a 500-word short story starting with a very specific line. To ensure it meets the exact word count and starts correctly, I will compose the   
story in Python and count the words, editing as necessary before returning the final result.

Story is short, add more detail.
The last person on Earth sat alone in a room. There was a knock on the door.

 He froze. For days, he had wandered through the empty city, calling out into streets echoing with his own voice, listening to the silence that always answered. He’d long 
scoured every corner for signs: lights, a figure on a distant rooftop, footprints. Instead, glass buildings stared blankly back, cars stood like monuments to the life that once 
pulsed here, and windows reflected only himself.
 Now, in what had become his refuge—a tidy room on the nineteenth floor of a hotel—he set down his battered mug of tea. He listened again. The knock resounded, gentle but 
unmistakable. He felt the weight of those years alone hang in the air, heavy as the clouds outside.
 ‘Impossible,’ he whispered. His own voice sounded foreign, hoarse with neglect and fear.
 He crept to the door. He pressed his ear to the wood. Silence returned. Then, a second knock. Three steady raps, polite, each spaced precisely apart. He pictured the empty 
hallway, the faded carpet, the silence beyond. He wondered if the loneliness had finally done it: if he’d begun to imagine things.
 He placed his hand on the doorknob. A thousand hopes and a hundred terrors galloped through him. His breath caught. He pulled it open a sliver.
 A figure stood in the hallway. Dressed in a raincoat, a hood drawn low. A scarf covered the lower half of their face. In their hand was a battered suitcase. The figure’s eyes 
shone, startled and red-rimmed, beneath the dim bulb.
 They stared at each other. Seconds passed.
 ‘I—’ he managed.
 The figure’s eyes brimmed with tears. A gloved hand reached up to tug the scarf from their mouth. A trembling smile appeared, hesitant, bright.
 ‘Do you mind if I come in?’ the stranger asked. The voice was raw, melodic, unused for too long.
 He nodded, unable to trust himself to speak. As the stranger stepped inside, the two regarded the room, the half-empty mug, the faded curtains.
 For a moment, neither spoke. Tears pooled in his eyes. He thought of the countless sunsets he’d watched alone, the constellations he’d named each night as hope faded with the 
daylight. He had begun to talk to walls, to scribble messages on paper for eyes that would never see them. Now he didn’t trust his own senses.
 ‘I thought I was the only one,’ she whispered. She let the suitcase fall to the floor. ‘I haven’t knocked on a door in so long.’
 He tried to laugh and failed, the sound emerging somewhere between a sob and a gasp. ‘I can’t believe—’
 She reached out, brushing his hand, a simple human touch electric in the silence.
 ‘You’re not alone,’ she said. Warmth blossomed in his chest. The storm outside rattled the windows, but inside, two souls found solace in a world remade.

The last person on Earth sat alone in a room. There was a knock on the door.

He froze. For days, he had wandered through the empty city, calling out into streets echoing with his own voice, listening to the silence that always answered. He’d long scoured
every corner for signs: lights, a figure on a distant rooftop, footprints. Instead, glass buildings stared blankly back, cars stood like monuments to life that once pulsed here,
and windows reflected only himself—an island of solitude amid a sea of stillness.
 Now, in what had become his refuge—a tidy room on the nineteenth floor of a hotel—he set down his battered mug of tea. The faint scent of dust mixed with the sharp tang of rain
wafted in from the cracked window. He listened again. The knock resounded, gentle but unmistakable. He felt the weight of those years alone hang in the air, heavy as the clouds 
outside. Sometimes, he wondered if he’d begun to dissolve into the furniture, to become another relic waiting in the darkness.
‘Impossible,’ he whispered. His own voice sounded foreign, hoarse with neglect and fear. He reached for the brass key he kept in his pocket, more out of habit than real hope.
He crept to the door. He pressed his ear to the wood. Silence returned. Then, a second knock. Three steady raps, polite, each spaced precisely apart. He pictured the empty 
hallway, the faded carpet, the silence beyond. He wondered if the loneliness had finally done it: if he’d begun to imagine things, or if memory itself had conspired to play 
tricks on him.
He placed his hand on the doorknob. A thousand hopes and a hundred terrors galloped through him. His breath caught. He pulled it open a sliver, heart pounding so loudly in his 
chest that he worried the noise would give his fear away.
A figure stood in the hallway. They wore a raincoat, a hood drawn low. A scarf covered the lower half of their face. In their hand was a battered suitcase, stickers torn and 
color faded by time. The figure’s eyes shone, startled and red-rimmed, beneath the flickering bulb overhead.
They stared at each other. Seconds passed, thick as molasses.
‘I—’ he managed, voice trembling with disbelief.
The figure’s eyes brimmed with tears. A gloved hand reached up to tug the scarf from their mouth. A trembling smile appeared, hesitant, bright, as if practicing the act of hope.
‘Do you mind if I come in?’ the stranger asked. The voice was raw, melodic, unused for too long.
He nodded, unable to trust himself to speak. As the stranger stepped inside, the two regarded the room—the half-empty mug, the faded curtains, the weathered maps tacked to the 
wall. The hush that followed was thick with the echo of all the unspoken words from lonely years.
For a long moment, neither spoke. Tears pooled in his eyes. He thought of the countless sunsets he’d watched alone, the constellations he’d named each night as hope faded with 
the daylight. He had begun to talk to walls, to scribble messages on paper for eyes that would never see them. Now he didn’t trust his own senses, as if reality itself was 
opening a door.
‘I thought I was the only one,’ she whispered. She let the suitcase fall to the floor. ‘I haven’t knocked on a door in so long.’
He tried to laugh and failed, the sound emerging somewhere between a sob and a gasp. ‘I can’t believe—’
She reached out, brushing his hand, a simple human touch electric in the silence. Her palm was warm—a miracle. He shuddered,
feeling the weight of solitude slide off his shoulders, replaced by something fragile and new.
‘You’re not alone,’ she said. Warmth blossomed in his chest. The storm outside rattled the windows, but inside, two souls found solace in a world remade.

The last person on Earth sat alone in a room. There was a knock on the door.

He froze. For days, he had wandered the empty city, calling into streets echoing with his voice, hearing only silence in reply. He’d searched every corner for signs: a light, a 
distant figure, footprints. But glass buildings stared blankly, cars stood as monuments to a vanished world, and windows reflected only himself—alone amid a sea of stillness.
 Now, in the tidy room he’d claimed on the nineteenth floor of a hotel, he set down his mug of tea. The faint scent of dust lingered. The knock came again, soft but real. He 
felt the years of solitude hang in the air, heavy as the clouds outside. Sometimes, he wondered if he’d begun to dissolve into the furniture, one more relic among ruins.
‘Impossible,’ he whispered. His voice sounded foreign, rough with neglect and fear. He crept to the door, pressed his ear against it. Silence returned. Then, a second knock: 
three steady raps, precise. He conjured an image of the empty hallway, the faded carpet, the endless quiet. Was this loneliness at last becoming a trick of the mind?
His hand hovered on the doorknob, heart pounding. He opened it a sliver.
A figure stood in the hall, wearing a raincoat, hood low, scarf around the lower face, and carrying a battered suitcase. Their eyes shone, startled and red-rimmed beneath the 
dim bulb above.
They stared at each other. Seconds dragged.
‘I—’ he began, his throat tight.
Tears welled in the figure’s eyes. A gloved hand tugged the scarf down, revealing a trembling smile he’d almost forgotten could exist.
‘Do you mind if I come in?’ the stranger asked, voice unused and cracked.
He nodded. The stranger stepped inside, eyes flicking to the half-empty mug, faded curtains, maps on a wall. A hush pressed in, thick with all the words left unsaid after years 
alone.
For a moment, neither moved. He thought of the sunsets—how he’d named constellations until hope faded with daylight. He had talked to the walls, left messages no one would read.
Now his own senses felt untrustworthy.
‘I thought I was the only one,’ she whispered, letting the suitcase fall. ‘I haven’t knocked on a door in so long.’
He tried to laugh, but it came out as a sob. ‘I can’t believe—’
She reached out, brushing his hand, a simple human touch electric in the silence. Her palm was warm—a miracle. He shuddered, feeling the weight of solitude sliding away, 
replaced by something fragile and precious.
‘You’re not alone,’ she said. Warmth bloomed in his chest. The storm rattled the windows, but inside, two souls found solace in a world remade.

The last person on Earth sat alone in a room. There was a knock on the door.

He froze. For days, he had wandered the empty city, calling into streets echoing with his voice, hearing only silence in reply. He’d searched every corner for signs: a light in 
a window, a distant figure, footprints. Sometimes he’d even hoped for the sound of a radio left on, or the faint scent of woodsmoke in chilled air. But glass buildings stared 
blankly, cars stood as monuments to a vanished world, and windows reflected only himself—alone amid a sea of stillness.
Now, in the tidy room he’d claimed on the nineteenth floor of a hotel, he set down his mug of tea. The faint scent of dust lingered, mingling with the memory of rain on pavement
far below. The knock came again, soft but real. He felt the years of solitude hang in the air, heavy as the clouds outside. Sometimes, he wondered if he’d begun to dissolve into
the furniture, one more relic among ruins, waiting for nothing.
‘Impossible,’ he whispered. His voice sounded foreign, rough with neglect and fear. He crept to the door, pressed his ear against it. Silence returned. Then, a second knock: 
three steady raps, precise. He conjured an image of the empty hallway, the faded carpet, the endless quiet. Was this loneliness at last becoming a trick of the mind?
His hand hovered on the doorknob, heart pounding. Each second felt suspended, thick with dread and a flicker of hope he hardly dared name. He opened it a sliver.
A figure stood in the hall, wearing a raincoat, hood low, scarf around the lower face, and carrying a battered suitcase. Their eyes shone, startled and red-rimmed beneath the 
dim bulb above.
They stared at each other. Seconds dragged, the silence between them full of questioning. For a moment, the world seemed to become smaller, folding around the patch of hallway 
where they met.
‘I—’ he began, his throat tight, every word suddenly alien.
Tears welled in the figure’s eyes. A gloved hand tugged the scarf down, revealing a trembling smile he’d almost forgotten could exist.
‘Do you mind if I come in?’ the stranger asked, voice unused and cracked.
He nodded. The stranger stepped inside, eyes flicking to the half-empty mug, faded curtains, maps on a wall. A hush pressed in, thick with all the words left unsaid after years 
alone. The stranger’s suitcase thumped softly on the carpet. She touched it lightly, as though to anchor herself to reality.
For a moment, neither moved. He thought of the sunsets—how he’d named constellations until hope faded with daylight. He had talked to the walls, left messages no one would read.
Now his own senses felt untrustworthy, as if the universe was being rewritten before his eyes.
‘I thought I was the only one,’ she whispered, letting the suitcase fall. ‘I haven’t knocked on a door in so long.’
He tried to laugh, but it came out as a sob. ‘I can’t believe—’
She reached out, brushing his hand, a simple human touch electric in the silence. Her palm was warm—a miracle. He shuddered, feeling the weight of solitude sliding away, 
replaced by something fragile and precious.
‘You’re not alone,’ she said. Warmth bloomed in his chest. The storm rattled the windows, but inside, two souls found solace in a world remade.

and windows reflected only himself—alone amid a sea of stillness.\n"

solitude hung in the air, heavy as the clouds outside. Sometimes he wondered if he’d begun to dissolve into the furniture—one more relic among ruins, waiting for nothing.\n"

knock: three steady raps, precise. He pictured the deserted hallway, faded carpet, the endless quiet. Had loneliness become a trick of the mind?\n"

    "He nodded. She stepped inside, gaze flicking to the half-empty mug, faded curtains, a map tacked to the wall. A hush pressed in, thick with all the words unsaid after years
alone. The suitcase thumped softly to the carpet as if she needed to touch reality.\n"

his own senses felt untrustworthy, as if the universe was being rewritten.\n"

by something fragile and precious.\n"

The last person on Earth sat alone in a room. There was a knock on the door.

He froze. For days he had wandered the empty city, calling into streets echoing with his voice, hearing only silence in reply. He’d searched every corner for signs: a light in a
window, a distant figure, footprints. But glass buildings stared blankly, cars stood as monuments to a vanished world, and windows reflected only himself—alone amid a sea of 
stillness.
Now, in the tidy room he’d claimed on the nineteenth floor of a hotel, he set down his mug of tea. The scent of dust lingered. The knock came again, soft but real. Years of 
solitude hung in the air, heavy as the clouds outside. Sometimes he wondered if he’d begun to dissolve into the furniture—one more relic among ruins, waiting for nothing.
‘Impossible,’ he whispered. His voice sounded foreign, rough with neglect and fear. He crept to the door, pressing his ear to the wood. Silence returned. Then, a second knock: 
three steady raps, precise. He pictured the deserted hallway, faded carpet, the endless quiet. Had loneliness become a trick of the mind?
His hand hovered on the doorknob, heart pounding. Each second was thick with dread and a flicker of hope he hardly dared name. He opened the door a sliver.
A figure stood in the hall, raincoat and hood low, scarf over their face, a battered suitcase in hand. Their eyes shone, startled and red-rimmed under the dim bulb.
They stared at each other—seconds dragging, silence between them full of questions. For a moment, the world seemed to shrink to this patch of hallway where they met.
‘I—’ he began, throat tight, words suddenly alien.
Tears welled in the figure’s eyes. A gloved hand tugged the scarf down, revealing a trembling smile he’d almost forgotten could exist.
‘Do you mind if I come in?’ the stranger asked, voice cracked with disuse.
He nodded. She stepped inside, gaze flicking to the half-empty mug, faded curtains, a map tacked to the wall. A hush pressed in, thick with all the words unsaid after years 
alone. The suitcase thumped softly to the carpet as if she needed to touch reality.
Neither moved at first. He thought of sunsets—how he’d named constellations until hope faded each night. He had talked to the walls, left messages no one would read. Now his own
senses felt untrustworthy, as if the universe was being rewritten.
‘I thought I was the only one,’ she whispered. ‘I haven’t knocked on a door in so long.’
He tried to laugh, but it came out a sob. ‘I can’t believe—’
She reached out, brushing his hand—a simple human touch electric in the silence. Her palm was warm, a miracle. He shuddered, the weight of solitude sliding away, replaced by 
something fragile and precious.
‘You’re not alone,’ she said. Warmth bloomed in his chest. The storm rattled the windows, but inside, two souls found solace in a world remade.

Tears welled in the figure’s eyes. A gloved hand tugged the scarf down, revealing a trembling smile he’d almost forgotten could exist.                                           
‘Do you mind if I come in?’ the stranger asked, voice cracked with disuse.                                                                                                       
He nodded. She stepped inside, gaze flicking to the half-empty mug, faded curtains, a map tacked to the wall. A hush pressed in, thick with all the words unsaid after years     
alone. The suitcase thumped softly to the carpet as if she needed to touch reality.                                                                                              
Neither moved at first. He thought of sunsets—how he’d named constellations until hope faded each night. He had talked to the walls, left messages no one would read. Now his own
senses felt untrustworthy, as if the universe was being rewritten.                                                                                                               
‘I thought I was the only one,’ she whispered. ‘I haven’t knocked on a door in so long.’                                                                                         
He tried to laugh, but it came out a sob. ‘I can’t believe—’                                                                                                                     
She reached out, brushing his hand—a simple human touch electric in the silence. Her palm was warm, a miracle. He shuddered, the weight of solitude sliding away, replaced by    
something fragile and precious.                                                                                                                                                  
‘You’re not alone,’ she said. Warmth bloomed in his chest. The storm rattled the windows, but inside, two souls found solace in a world remade."""

  """The last person on Earth sat alone in a room. There was a knock on the door.                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  He froze. For days he had wandered the empty city, calling into streets echoing with his voice, hearing only silence in reply. He’d searched every corner for signs: a light   
  in a window, a distant figure, footprints. But glass buildings stared blankly, cars stood as monuments to a vanished world, and windows reflected only himself—alone amid a    
  sea of stillness.                                                                                                                                                              
  Now, in the tidy room he’d claimed on the nineteenth floor of a hotel, he set down his mug of tea. The scent of dust lingered. The knock came again, soft but real. Years of   
  solitude hung in the air, heavy as the clouds outside. Sometimes he wondered if he’d begun to dissolve into the furniture—one more relic among ruins, waiting for nothing.     
  ‘Impossible,’ he whispered. His voice sounded foreign, rough with neglect and fear. He crept to the door, pressing his ear to the wood. Silence returned. Then, a second       
  knock: three steady raps, precise. He pictured the deserted hallway, faded carpet, the endless quiet. Had loneliness become a trick of the mind?                               
  His hand hovered on the doorknob, heart pounding. Each second was thick with dread and a flicker of hope he hardly dared name. He opened the door a sliver.                    
  A figure stood in the hall, raincoat and hood low, scarf over their face, a battered suitcase in hand. Their eyes shone, startled and red-rimmed under the dim bulb.
