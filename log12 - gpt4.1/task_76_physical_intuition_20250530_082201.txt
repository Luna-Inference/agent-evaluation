Thought: To answer this question, I should explain the physics concept which is responsible for this phenomenon. I recall that it has to do with the conservation of angular     
momentum: as a figure skater pulls their arms in, they reduce their moment of inertia, causing them to spin faster in order to conserve angular momentum. I'll compose a concise 
explanation using these terms.

Out - Final answer: A spinning figure skater spins faster when they pull their arms close to their body due to the conservation of angular momentum. When the skater pulls their 
arms in, they decrease their moment of inertia (the resistance to rotational motion). Since angular momentum must be conserved when there are no external torques, the decrease 
in moment of inertia causes an increase in rotational speed (angular velocity) so that the product of moment of inertia and angular velocity remains constant. This is why the 
skater spins faster with arms pulled in.

Output:
A spinning figure skater spins faster when they pull their arms close to their body due to the conservation of angular momentum. When the skater pulls their arms in, they decrease their moment of inertia (the resistance to rotational motion). Since angular momentum must be conserved when there are no external torques, the decrease in moment of inertia causes an increase in rotational speed (angular velocity) so that the product of moment of inertia and angular velocity remains constant. This is why the skater spins faster with arms pulled in.
