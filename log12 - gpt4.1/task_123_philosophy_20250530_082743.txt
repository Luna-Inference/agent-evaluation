Thought: To answer this question, I need to first get concise summaries of Kant's categorical imperative and utilitarian ethics, especially as they relate to AI development.    
Next, I need to identify how each framework would guide or constrain modern AI, and finally compare and contrast them. I will begin by searching for how Kant's categorical      
imperative applies to AI, then do the same for utilitarian ethics, and finally synthesize the information.

Tae Wan Kim, John Hooker, and Thomas Donaldson make an attempt, in recent articles, to solve the alignment problem. As they define the alignment problem, it is the issue of how 
to give AI systems moral intelligence. They contend that one might program machines with a version of Kantian ethics cast in deontic modal logic. On their view, machines can be 
aligned with human values if such machines ...

the categorical imperative or the highest moral law is the command of an action which is 'objectively necessity of itself' (p.25). An action which is necessary by itself, is an 
action wherein a personal maxim can be universalised as a law. Kant writes about the categorical imperative: "There is, therefore, only a single categorical

Out - Final answer: Kant's categorical imperative: Kant's categorical imperative, when applied to AI development, requires that AI systems obey universal moral laws and treat 
all individuals as ends in themselves, not merely as means. This means programming AI with principles that could be adopted as universal maxims—such as fairness, transparency, 
and respect for human autonomy. Kantian AI ethics focuses on consistency, procedural justice, and respecting rights regardless of outcomes.

Utilitarianism: Utilitarian ethics guides AI development towards maximizing total well-being and minimizing harm for the greatest number. Utilitarian AI ethicists design systems
to produce the optimal balance of benefits over harms, often requiring aggregate analyses and outcome predictions. The emphasis is on consequences, allowing flexibility but 
risking disregard for minority rights or justice in specific cases.

Contrast: In the context of AI:
- Kant's framework prioritizes universalizable rules and the intrinsic dignity of individuals, even if adhering to these rules sometimes produces less overall happiness.
- Utilitarianism prioritizes the outcome—AI systems can override individual interests if doing so increases total or average well-being.
Kantian approaches provide clear boundaries for AI actions, while utilitarian approaches may allow more innovation but risk moral trade-offs. Real-world AI development 
increasingly calls for a balance between these frameworks: for example, ensuring fairness (Kantian) while also maximizing social good (Utilitarian).
