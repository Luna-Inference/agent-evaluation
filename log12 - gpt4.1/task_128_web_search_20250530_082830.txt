identify the top 3 electric vehicles in 2024.

Thought: From the search results, several models are repeatedly listed among "best" or "top-rated" electric vehicles in 2024. Namely: Hyundai IONIQ 6, Tesla Model 3, and Kia EV6
GT. Some lists also mention Hyundai IONIQ 5 and Genesis Electrified G80, but Hyundai IONIQ 6, Tesla Model 3, and Kia EV6 GT seem to be featured frequently. To be precise, I will
double-check mentions to establish the definitive top 3. Then, I will search separately for recent reviews and ratings for each of these three vehicles.
