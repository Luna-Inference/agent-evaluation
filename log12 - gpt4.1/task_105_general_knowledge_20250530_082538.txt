Thought: The search has provided a wide range of sources highlighting the Strait of Hormuz's critical role as a global energy chokepoint. Key themes repeatedly mentioned include
its geographic position as a narrow passage connecting major oil-producing Gulf states with the world market, the massive volume of oil passing through (up to a third or even   
40% of global seaborne oil trade), and its vulnerability to geopolitical tension, particularly involving Iran and Western powers. I will now synthesize this information into a  
clear answer about its geopolitical implications and strategic value for oil trade.

Out - Final answer: The Strait of Hormuz is one of the world's most strategically vital maritime chokepoints, connecting the Persian Gulf with the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian 
Sea. It is the primary route for oil and gas exports from key Middle Eastern producers—such as Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, and the UAE—to international markets. Around a 
third to 40% of global seaborne oil passes through this narrow passage daily. Disruption at the strait, whether from military conflict, political tension, or deliberate blockade
(as sometimes threatened by Iran), can cause global oil prices to spike and create broad economic instability. The heavy presence of military forces—including those of the U.S. 
and allies—underscores its geopolitical sensitivity. Thus, the strait's security is not just a regional but a global concern, making it a frequent flashpoint in international 
relations and energy security.
