Thought: To prove that √2 is irrational by contradiction, I will first state the classic assumption: suppose √2 is rational, so it can be written as a reduced fraction a/b,     
where a and b are coprime integers (b ≠ 0). Then I will show that this leads to a contradiction because both a and b end up being even, violating their coprimality. I will      
outline this proof step by step and then provide the answer.

Assume, for contradiction, that √2 is rational. That means there exist coprime integers a and b (b ≠ 0) such that √2 = a / b, and the fraction is in lowest terms.
Squaring both sides, we have 2 = a^2 / b^2, which implies a^2 = 2b^2.
Thus, a^2 is even, since it is 2 times an integer (b^2). Therefore, a must be even (since the square of an odd number is odd).
Let a = 2k for some integer k. Substitute: (2k)^2 = 2b^2 ⇒ 4k^2 = 2b^2 ⇒ 2k^2 = b^2.
Thus, b^2 is even, so b is also even for the same reason.
But this means both a and b are even, so they have at least 2 as a common factor. This contradicts the assumption that a / b is in lowest terms (coprime).
Therefore, our initial assumption is false. √2 is irrational.
