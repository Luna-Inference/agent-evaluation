Thought: To solve this, I need to analyze the sentence's structure and locate all subordinate clauses—these include dependent adverbial, adjective (relative), and noun clauses. 
I will identify conjunctions and relative pronouns that typically introduce subordinate clauses. Let's break down the sentence by looking for these markers.

Thought: I have now parsed and identified all subordinate clauses in the sentence. To summarize: there are three subordinate clauses—an adverbial clause ("Although he knew that 
the project, which had been delayed multiple times, would require extensive revisions"), a noun clause ("that the project, which had been delayed multiple times, would require  
extensive revisions"), and a relative clause ("which had been delayed multiple times"). I will now clearly list these as the final answer.
