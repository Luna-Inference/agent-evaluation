Yes. legally it is the other party's money- they made a mistake. Imagine if it was the other way around and you were shorted the money- you would be demanding the difference. 
Besides it is just the right thing to do to give the money back.

As someone who has done accounting and been a front-end manager in a retail store for over 10 years (combined), the cashier will be in much more trouble if their drawer is short
than if someone brings back money to point out their mistake. I have worked for 2 companies in 2 states. A cashier will not be fired for 1 mistake.

Thought: The search results show that discussions on this topic reference both ethical and legal principles. Ethically, returning extra change is often seen as "the right thing 
to do" since keeping it means benefiting from someone else’s mistake and could cause harm to the cashier or the store. Furthermore, a source from ABC News demonstrates that many
people choose to return the money. Legal perspectives also indicate that you're expected to return money that isn't yours.
