[How Does Plate Tectonics Affect the Earth?](https://enviroliteracy.org/how-does-plate-tectonics-affect-the-earth/)
The Himalayas, the highest mountain range on Earth, are a prime example of this process. They were formed by the collision of the Indian and Eurasian plates millions of years 
ago and continue to rise even today. ... The movement of tectonic plates is not smooth; rather, they often become stuck along fault lines, where the plates grind against ...

[Plate Tectonics - National Geographic Society](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/plate-tectonics/)
Plate tectonics is a scientific theory that explains how major landforms are created as a result of Earth's subterranean movements. The theory, which solidified in the 1960s, 
transformed the earth sciences by explaining many phenomena, including mountain building events, volcanoes, and earthquakes. In plate tectonics, Earth's outermost layer, or 
lithosphere —made up of the crust and ...

The extent to which plate tectonics has influenced Earth's evolution through geologic time depends on when the process started. This is a matter of ongoing debate among 
geologists. The principal problem is that almost all oceanic crust older than about 200 million years has been obliterated by subduction.Some of the other hallmarks of 
subduction—such as the high-pressure low-temperature ...

Earth being spherical, its tectonic plates is broken into dozens of curved sections. The border between two tectonic plates is known as a boundary. Based on the size of the 
plate, they are categorized into major, minor, and micro. 1. Major Plates. According to the World Atlas, there are seven major tectonic plates in all.

[Earth's Shifting Tectonic Plates - Education](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/earths-tectonic-plates/)
Tectonic plates, the massive slabs of Earth's lithosphere that help define our continents and ocean, are constantly on the move. Plate tectonics is driven by a variety of 
forces: dynamic movement in the mantle, dense oceanic crust interacting with the ductile asthenosphere, even the rotation of the planet. Geologists studying the Earth use 
scientific observation and evidence to construct a ...

Thought: From the search results, several sources mention that the Himalayas formed as a result of the collision between the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. This process   
continues today, causing the mountains to rise and resulting in ongoing geological activity such as earthquakes. Transform boundaries, mountain building events, and the folding 
and faulting of rock layers are all critical aspects of this process.

Out - Final answer: The geology and geography of the Himalayas have been shaped by tectonic plate movements, specifically the collision of the Indian and Eurasian plates. 
Millions of years ago, the Indian Plate drifted northwards and collided with the Eurasian Plate. This immense collision caused the Earth's crust to buckle, fold, and uplift, 
leading to the formation of the Himalayan mountain range—the highest on Earth. This tectonic process continues today, so the Himalayas are still rising and are characterized by 
frequent earthquakes. The ongoing plate movement also results in dramatic folding and faulting of rocks, varied geological formations, and significant changes in the region's 
geography over time.
