Thought: Since this is a visual puzzle, I would need access to the actual geometric pieces, such as an image or a detailed description. The prompt only contains a general       
description, and there is no image or specific information about the pieces. Therefore, my first step should be to clarify if there is an image or further detail about the      
geometric pieces, or search for a similar puzzle online to reference.

Thought: The search results give links to several classic square-forming puzzles, such as tangrams, five-piece and four-piece square puzzles, and the "Missing Square" puzzle.   
However, since you have not provided a specific description, list of shapes, or an image of the pieces, I cannot provide a tailored step-by-step arrangement for your exact      
puzzle.                                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
If you can upload an image of your puzzle or describe the exact set and shapes of the pieces (e.g. "it's a tangram", or "I have two large triangles, one square, two small       
triangles", etc.), I could solve or illustrate the arrangement.
