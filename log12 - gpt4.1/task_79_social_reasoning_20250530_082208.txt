Out - Final answer: When a new manager implements changes in a workplace, group dynamics are significantly affected. Team members may react with uncertainty or anxiety as they 
adapt to a new leadership style. Resistance is common and can stem from several sources: fear of losing status or comfort, lack of trust in the new manager, misunderstanding the
purpose of the change, or concerns about personal competence with new processes.

Within the group, informal leaders or subgroups may influence peers to support or resist change, affecting overall team cohesion. The existing culture, previous experiences with
management, and the quality of relationships among team members also shape group responses. If resistance grows, teams may become divided or polarized, morale can drop, and 
communication may suffer, further hindering the change.

To manage group dynamics effectively, the new manager should engage in open communication—explaining the reasons for change, listening to concerns, and involving team members in
implementation. Building trust and demonstrating empathy are critical to overcoming resistance. By understanding the underlying causes of resistance and actively working to 
foster collaboration, the manager can help the team adapt and thrive.
