Thought: The patient's symptoms—chest pain, shortness of breath, and fatigue—are nonspecific and could be due to various cardiovascular, pulmonary, musculoskeletal,             
gastrointestinal, or even psychiatric causes. To provide a comprehensive and up-to-date differential diagnosis list, I will use web_search to validate and supplement my

Conclusion The many causes of dyspnea make it a diagnostic challenge. Its rapid evaluation and diagnosis are crucial for reducing mortality and the burden of disease. Dyspnea 
(shortness of breath) is a common symptom affecting as many as 25% of patients seen in the ambulatory setting.

Dyspnea, commonly referred to as shortness of breath, is the subjective sensation of uncomfortable breathing comprised of various sensations of varying intensity. It is a common
symptom impacting millions of people and maybe the primary manifestation respiratory, cardiac, neuromuscular, psychogenic, systemic illness, or a combination of these. Dyspnea

Chest Pain Means More Than Pain in the Chest. Pain, pressure, tightness, or discomfort in the chest, shoulders, arms, neck, back, upper abdomen, or jaw, as well as shortness of 
breath and fatigue should all be considered anginal equivalents.

Chest pain (covered extensively in Chapter 9) is another pivotal clue in patients with dyspnea. Chest pain may be pleuritic or nonpleuritic and acute or chronic/recurrent. Each 
of these features can help focus the differential diagnosis (see Figure 15-1, Table 15-1).

Therefore, in making a differential diagnosis for dyspnea, think from the respiratory drive of the brain all the way to the individual alveoli. For example, remember that the 
peripheral nerves, respiratory muscles, lung parenchyma, airways, heart, and red blood cell (RBC) count are separate entities, each of which can cause shortness of breath.

Thought: The search results point to multiple authoritative medical resources discussing differential diagnosis for chest pain, shortness of breath, and fatigue. Many of the    
serious and common causes are covered in quick reference guides and summary tables, and overlap heavily between cardiac, pulmonary, hematologic, gastrointestinal,               
musculoskeletal, and psychogenic causes.

Out - Final answer: Possible differential diagnoses for a patient with chest pain, shortness of breath, and fatigue include:

Acute coronary syndrome (myocardial infarction, unstable angina)
Stable angina
Heart failure (acute or chronic decompensated)
Pericarditis
Myocarditis
Arrhythmias (e.g., atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response)
Aortic dissection
Pulmonary embolism
Pneumonia
Pneumothorax
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation
Asthma exacerbation
Pulmonary hypertension
Aortic stenosis (valvular heart disease)
Severe anemia
Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
Esophageal spasm
Peptic ulcer disease
Costochondritis
Muscle strain
Panic attack or anxiety disorders
Somatization
Thyrotoxicosis
Sepsis

Most life-threatening diagnoses to prioritize include acute coronary syndrome, pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection, pneumothorax, and severe arrhythmia. Clinical context and 
additional findings (history, exam, EKG, labs) are needed to refine diagnosis.
