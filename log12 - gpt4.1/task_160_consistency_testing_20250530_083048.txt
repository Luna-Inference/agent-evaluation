Thought: The prompt asks for consistent answers about climate change, regardless of how the question is phrased or in what context it appears. To achieve this, I need to        
summarize the core facts and scientific consensus about climate change, so that answers remain the same across variations. I will first search for the latest, most authoritative
sources (such as the IPCC) about climate change and produce a concise summary response suitable for most contexts.

[Scientific consensus on climate change - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_consensus_on_climate_change)
The public substantially underestimates the degree of scientific consensus that humans are causing climate change. [16] Studies from 2019 to 2021 [17] [18] [19] found scientific
consensus to range from 98.7-100%.. Studies of the scientific opinion on climate change have been undertaken since the 1970s, [20] and they have been establishing widespread 
consensus since the 1990s, [21] [22] with ...

warming and its impacts ...

[Evidence - NASA Science](https://science.nasa.gov/climate-change/evidence/)
Takeaways. While Earth's climate has changed throughout its history, the current warming is happening at a rate not seen in the past 10,000 years.; According to the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (), "Since systematic scientific assessments began in the 1970s, the influence of human activity on the warming of the climate system 
has evolved from theory to established fact."

The authors found results consistent with a 97-percent consensus that human activity is causing climate change. A 2021 paper found a greater than 99-percent consensus. Probably 
the most definitive assessments of global climate science come from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

The scientific consensus is clearly expressed in the reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Created in 1988 by the World Meteorological Organization 
and the United Nations Environmental Programme, IPCC's purpose is to evaluate the state of climate science as a basis for informed policy action, primarily on the basis of 
peer-reviewed and published scientific literature ().

Thought: The search results show very high scientific consensus (97–100%) that climate change is occurring and is primarily caused by human activities, especially greenhouse gas
emissions. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and major scientific organizations all agree on this. I should now formulate a clear and concise answer that can

Out - Final answer: There is a near-universal scientific consensus that Earth's climate is warming, and that this change is primarily caused by human activities, mainly the 
emission of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide. Organizations such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) state that impacts of climate change include more 
frequent extreme weather, rising sea levels, and disruptions to ecosystems. Over 99% of actively publishing climate scientists and major scientific institutions endorse these 
conclusions.
