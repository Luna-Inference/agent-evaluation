Thought: To compile a comparative analysis of renewable energy policies across five countries—including recent legislative changes—I should first decide on five representative  
countries (for diversity and relevance). Then, I should use web_search to gather current policy information and legislative updates for each country. I will organize and compare
the findings in my final answer.                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Let me begin by selecting five countries that are geographically and economically diverse: United States, Germany, China, India, and Brazil.                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now, I will search for renewable energy policy and recent legislation for each country, starting with the United States.

Out - Final answer: Comparative Analysis:
All five countries have made considerable legislative and policy strides in 2023-2024, focusing on raising renewable energy targets, streamlining project approval, and 
incentivizing advanced technologies (solar, wind, hydrogen). The U.S. and Germany focus on aligning grid modernization and aggressive decarbonization timelines. China and India 
are scaling deployment at record rates and updating laws to formalize renewable prioritization. Brazil prioritizes large-scale investment attraction, a comprehensive transition 
law, and strong support for new technologies like hydrogen. Key differences are in the mechanisms (RPS, feed-in tariffs, auctions), the timeline aggressiveness, and the scope of
financial incentives.

Summary by country:
United States: Major recent initiatives include the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which collectively fund clean energy deployment, expand 
tax credits, accelerate grid modernization, and encourage domestic manufacturing. A major legislative update is the proposed American Renewable Energy Act of 2024, aiming to 
further raise renewable targets, support grid modernization, and encourage distributed generation. State-level Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) targets are also being revised
upward.

Germany: The 2023 amendment to the Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG 2023) is the country's main recent legislative change, setting much higher expansion targets and introducing
faster planning approval for renewable projects. Feed-in tariffs for small PV projects are set to be reduced gradually. 2024 proposals focus on streamlining grid connections and
supporting solar and wind with new incentives. Germany is also implementing a more aggressive transition to reach climate neutrality by 2045.

China: In 2023-24, China finalized a sweeping new Energy Law (in force 2025), consolidating energy regulation, prioritizing renewable expansion, and introducing new consumption 
benchmarks for provinces. China added record solar and wind capacity in 2023-24, implemented major incentives for UHV transmission and hydrogen, and began revising the Renewable
Energy Law and Electric Power Law to enhance green energy prioritization.

India: New renewable consumption norms for power distributors take effect April 2024. Rapid growth in solar (94 GW as of 2024), record investments, and new rooftop solar program
(PM Surya Ghar Yojana) mark recent policy. The government increased Renewable Consumption Obligations (formerly RPOs), raised state targets, and boosted budget allocations for 
clean energy in 2024. Hydrogen policy is evolving, and regulatory updates target green hydrogen and grid expansion.

Brazil: The most significant recent development is the 2024 enactment of the National Energy Transition Policy (PONTE) and complementary Energy Acceleration Law, aiming to 
attract BRL 2 trillion in investment. Congress passed the Hydrogen Legal Framework in July 2024. Auctions remain the primary tool for renewables expansion. The new policy 
framework seeks to facilitate grid investment, hydrogen, and social/environmental sustainability.
