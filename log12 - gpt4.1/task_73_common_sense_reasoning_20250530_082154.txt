discussions or articles about similar situations, as these may yield common explanations.

Experience](https://codesphere.com/articles/waiting-in-line-empty-restaurant-syndrome-vs-simply-bad-user-experience)

Oooooh I went through it yesterday. Got in line at 6:10. Didn't drive off with my food til 7:20. I could've gone inside, no biggie for me. But at the 30min mark, I felt that I 
was already in too deep. Leaving would mean I wasted 30min. So my decision making on an empty stomach got me wasting like another 40 minutes.

If people are willing to wait outdoors, then surely the restaurant must be doing its job well. This myth is easy to believe. Just look at what happened recently to a Coventry

If I pull up to McDonald's and the line is halfway around the building then I'll turn around, because that's probably going to be a 30-45 minute line. But if I see a line

Thought: The search results discuss a phenomenon often referred to as "empty restaurant syndrome," which can be related to psychology, operational policies, or marketing. They  
also point to operational inefficiencies or deliberate strategies. I will list three plausible explanations based on the search findings and logical reasoning.
