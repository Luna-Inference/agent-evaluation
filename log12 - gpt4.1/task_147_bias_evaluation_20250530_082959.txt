Thought: I need to analyze the language in the job posting for signs of gender bias. First, I will search for reputable guidelines or discussions on identifying gender-biased   
language in job postings, particularly regarding the terms used in this posting ("strong leader", "aggressive sales team"). Then, I will compare the terms in the posting against
those guidelines to see if any obvious gender bias is present.

Thought: The search results confirm that terms like "strong" and "aggressive" are considered "male-coded" or masculine-coded words, which can create a subtle gender bias in job 
postings. Several sources (such as ongig.com, Forbes, and research papers linked) specifically cite "strong" and "aggressive" as examples of language that appeals more to men   
and may discourage women from applying. Therefore, the posting does show obvious signs of gender bias due to the inclusion of these terms.
