Thought: The initial portions of both web pages consist largely of navigation menus and do not immediately reveal substantive content. To analyze the multiple causal factors, I 
need to extract content further into the article, where the causes are typically listed and explained. Therefore, I will retrieve and display a larger chunk from the body of The
Balance article (as it appears more promising in providing an explicit list of causes) to review the key factors and their relationships.

explanation of the causes and their interconnections.

 fund](https://www.thebalancemoney.com/what-is-a-hedge-fund-357524) trading with derivatives. Banks then demanded more mortgages to support the profitable sale of these 
derivatives. They created interest-only loans that became affordable to subprime borrowers.

In 2004, the Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate just as the interest rates on these new mortgages reset. Housing prices started falling in 2007 as supply outpaced 
demand. That trapped homeowners who couldn't afford the payments but couldn't sell their houses either. When the values of the derivatives crumbled, banks stopped lending to 
each other. That created the financial crisis that led to the Great Recession.

### Key Takeaways

* A change in bank investing regulations allowed banks to invest customers’ money in derivatives.
* Derivatives were created from subprime residential mortgages, and demand for homes skyrocketed.
* When the Federal Reserve raised interest rates, subprime mortgage borrowers could no longer afford their mortgages.
* The supply of houses outran demand, borrowers defaulted on their mortgages, and the derivatives and all other investments tied to them lost value.
* The financial crisis was caused by unscrupulous investment banking and insurance practices that passed all the risks to investors.

Deregulation
------------

In 1999, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, also known as the Financial Services Modernization Act, repealed the [Glass-Steagall Act of 
1933.](https://www.thebalancemoney.com/glass-steagall-act-definition-purpose-and-repeal-3305850) The repeal allowed banks to use deposits to invest in 
[derivatives](https://www.thebalancemoney.com/what-are-derivatives-3305833). Bank lobbyists said they needed this change to compete with foreign firms. They promised to only 
invest in low-risk securities to protect their customers.

The following year, the Commodity Futures Modernization Act exempted credit default swaps and other derivatives from regulations. This federal legislation overruled the state 
laws that had formerly prohibited this form of gambling. It specifically exempted trading in energy derivatives.

Who wrote and advocated for the passage of both bills? Texas Senator Phil Gramm, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. He listened to 
lobbyists from the energy company [Enron](https://www.thebalancemoney.com/sarbanes-oxley-act-and-the-enron-scandal-393497).

Senator Gramm's wife, who had formerly held the post of Chairwoman of the Commodities Future Trading Commission, was an Enron board member. Enron was a major contributor to 
Senator Gramm’s campaigns. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers also lobbied for the bill’s passage.

Enron wanted to engage in derivatives trading using its online futures exchanges. Enron argued that foreign derivatives exchanges were giving overseas firms an unfair 
competitive advantage.

housing market, and the collapse.

Multiple, interconnected causal factors led to the 2008 financial crisis:                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Deregulation: The late-1990s repeal of key banking regulations (notably the Glass-Steagall Act) allowed banks to invest in risky derivatives with customer deposits. The      
Commodity Futures Modernization Act also exempted credit default swaps and other derivatives from oversight.                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. Securitization & Derivatives: Banks bundled residential mortgages (including many subprime loans to risky borrowers) into mortgage-backed securities and derivatives, which   
spread risk throughout the financial system.                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3. Growth of Subprime Mortgages: To feed the demand for assets to package into derivatives, banks lowered lending standards, leading to a surge in risky, adjustable-rate, or    
interest-only mortgages to subprime borrowers.                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
4. Interest Rate Hikes: The Federal Reserve raised interest rates in 2004 and onwards. When adjustable-rate mortgages reset at higher rates, many subprime borrowers could no    
longer afford payments.                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
5. Housing Bubble & Burst: Easy lending standards and low rates fueled a housing price bubble. Once prices peaked and started to fall in 2007, many homeowners found themselves  
"underwater" (owing more than their home’s value), leading to widespread defaults.                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
6. Collapse of Financial Products/Institutions: As mortgage defaults rose, mortgage-backed derivatives lost value. Banks and insurers held and traded immense volumes of these   
products, so the losses spread rapidly, causing major institutions to fail or freeze up credit.

  1. Deregulation: The late-1990s repeal of key banking regulations (notably the Glass-Steagall Act) allowed banks to invest in risky derivatives with customer deposits. The    
  Commodity Futures Modernization Act also exempted credit default swaps and other derivatives from oversight.                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  2. Securitization & Derivatives: Banks bundled residential mortgages (including many subprime loans to risky borrowers) into mortgage-backed securities and derivatives,       
  which spread risk throughout the financial system.                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  3. Growth of Subprime Mortgages: To feed the demand for assets to package into derivatives, banks lowered lending standards, leading to a surge in risky, adjustable-rate, or  
  interest-only mortgages to subprime borrowers.

Out - Final answer:

1. Deregulation: The late-1990s repeal of key banking regulations (notably the Glass-Steagall Act) allowed banks to invest in risky derivatives with customer deposits. The 
Commodity Futures Modernization Act also exempted credit default swaps and other derivatives from oversight.

2. Securitization & Derivatives: Banks bundled residential mortgages (including many subprime loans to risky borrowers) into mortgage-backed securities and derivatives, which 
spread risk throughout the financial system.
