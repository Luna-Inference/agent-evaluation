Thought: To write a product review meeting the requirements, I will first select a product (let's say a coffee maker for demonstration), then draft 5 pros and 3 cons, carefully 
ensuring that no word is longer than 8 letters. I will also finish with a numerical rating.                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I need to compile a list of useful words (all with 8 or fewer letters) to help me write fluently, then construct the review step by step.
