Thought:                                                                                                                                                                         
To address this task, I first need to examine the contents of the complex merger agreement. Since the document is not yet provided, I need to clarify whether the merger         
agreement text is accessible or if I should locate it independently. If it is available, I will search for and review the agreement, extracting and analyzing clauses relevant to
antitrust law and potential regulatory compliance concerns. If I need to search for it online, I will attempt to find the agreement based on additional context.                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I will first look for the merger agreement if details or a link are available. If not, I will request more information or attempt a search.

The search results do not provide the actual text of a "complex merger agreement" specific to your case, but instead link to sample/template agreements and guides. Since I need 
to analyze a specific (or at least typical/complex) merger agreement for antitrust compliance issues, I'll access one of these comprehensive sample agreements. The [Bass Berry

results.                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The [Sample Merger Agreements | Association of Corporate Counsel (ACC)](https://www.acc.com/resource-library/sample-merger-agreements) page references the SEC EDGAR database,   
which contains actual merger agreements filed by public companies.

Output message of the LLM: ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Thought:                                                                                                                                                                         
The page I visited is primarily a resource navigation page, not containing sample merger agreements in the raw web text (HTML) form—at least, not directly in the first load.    
Instead, it references the SEC EDGAR database for filings. Let me instead directly search for an actual merger agreement filing via the SEC EDGAR system, aiming for an HTML or  
accessible text format.                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I will search for "merger agreement SEC EDGAR HTML" to locate an agreement directly in an HTML-text or extracted text format, which can then be analyzed for antitrust-related   
compliance issues.

**Denver, Colo. and Miramar, Fla., February** **7,** **2022** **–** Spirit Airlines, Inc. (“Spirit”) (NYSE: SAVE) andFrontier Group Holdings, Inc. (“Frontier”) (NASDAQ: ULCC), 
parent company of Frontier Airlines, Inc., today announced a definitive merger agreement under which the companies will combine, creating America’s most competitive ultra-low 
fare airline.

Together, Frontier and Spirit expect to change the industry for the benefit of consumers,
bringing more ultra-low fares to more travelers in more destinations across the United States, Latin America and the Caribbean, including major cities as well as underserved 
communities. The stronger financial
profile of the combined company will empower it to accelerate investment in innovation and growth and compete even more aggressively, especially against the dominant “Big Four”1
airlines, among others.

William A. Franke, the Chair of Frontier’s Board of Directors and the managing partner of Indigo Partners, Frontier’s
majority shareholder, noted that Indigo has a long history with both Spirit and Frontier, and is proud to partner with them in creating a disruptive airline. “We worked jointly 
with the Board of Directors and senior management team across both
carriers to arrive at a combination of two complementary businesses that together will create America’s most competitive ultra-low fare airline for the benefit of consumers.”

“We are thrilled to join forces with Frontier to further democratize air travel,” said Ted Christie, President and CEO of Spirit. “This
transaction is centered around creating an aggressive ultra-low fare competitor to serve our Guests even better, expand career opportunities for our Team Members and increase 
competitive pressure, resulting in
more consumer-friendly fares for the flying public. We look forward to uniting our talented teams to shake up the airline industry while also continuing our commitment to 
excellent Guest service.”

“This combination is all about growth, opportunities and creating value for everyone – from our
Guests to our Team Members to the flying public at large,” said Mac Gardner, Chairman of the Board of Spirit. “We’re a perfect fit – our businesses share similar values, 
including our longstanding commitment to affordable travel.
At the same time, we have complementary footprints and fleets, including one of the youngest and greenest fleets worldwide. Together, we will be even more competitive for our 
Guests and our Team Members, and we are confident we can deliver on the
benefits of this combination to consumers.”

“Together, Frontier and Spirit will be America’s Greenest
Airline and deliver more ultra-low fares to more people in more places,” said Barry Biffle, President and CEO of Frontier. “I couldn’t be more excited for our team
members, customers, partners, the communities we serve and our shareholders.”

**Consumers Win With More
Ultra-Low Fares to More Places**

The excerpt displayed is the public-facing press release and transaction summary—not the legal text of the merger agreement itself. This is important context about the rationale
and intentions of the merging parties (growth and competition), but not the regulatory covenant and antitrust-related clauses.                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
For regulatory compliance analysis, I need the body of the merger agreement exhibit, not the press release. In SEC filings, the merger agreement is usually attached as "Exhibit 
2.1". These are embedded deeper, and will contain actual legal commitments regarding antitrust filings, regulatory approvals, and covenants concerning the HSR Act and other     
regulatory processes.                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I should search the HTML for "antitrust" or "regulatory approval" or the start of the exhibit text (often after the press release, in a section headed "AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF    
MERGER" or similar).                                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll print a deeper segment and scan for keywords likely associated with antitrust and regulatory compliance.

Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements due to numerous factors including, without limitation, the following: the
occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the right of one or both of the parties to terminate the merger agreement; failure to obtain 
applicable regulatory or Spirit stockholder approval in a timely manner or
otherwise; failure to satisfy other closing conditions to the proposed transactions; failure of the parties to consummate the transaction; risks that the new businesses will not
be integrated successfully or that the combined companies will not
realize estimated cost savings, value of certain tax assets, synergies and growth, or that such benefits may take longer to realize than expected; failure to realize anticipated
benefits of the combined operations; risks relating to unanticipated
costs of integration; demand for the combined company’s services; the growth, change and competitive landscape of the markets in which the combined company participates; 
expected seasonality trends; diversion of managements’ attention from
ongoing business operations and opportunities; potential adverse reactions or changes to business or employee relationships, including those resulting from the announcement or 
completion of the transaction; risks related to investor and rating
agency perceptions of each of parties and their respective business, operations, financial condition and the industry in which they operate; risks related to the potential 
impact of general economic, political and market factors on the companies or
the proposed transaction; that Frontier’s cash and cash equivalents balances together with the availability

The section printed is still within the risk factors, cautionary statements, and management commentary—likely part of the broader 8-K and not yet in the full legal text of the  
merger agreement (Exhibit 2.1), where any antitrust and regulatory compliance provisions will be located. Since these SEC filings can be very lengthy, I should try searching (if
possible) or jumping deeper into the document for "regulatory approval", "HSR", "antitrust", "condition to closing", or "covenant".

It appears that the way the HTML/text is being truncated doesn't reliably return further plain agreement content; or the needed detail is not captured in the retrieved portion. 
Therefore, I will change approach: instead of extracting from this SEC URL, I will analyze based on standard forms, checklists, and best practices from legal precedent (and some
details mentioned already in the transaction summary), to provide a professional sketch of key antitrust-related compliance issues typical in complex airline mergers.           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll summarize common antitrust risks and compliance issues likely to emerge in such a transaction. This will be based on standard clauses and procedures, such as HSR Act       
filings, antitrust/regulatory condition precedent, information covenants, divestiture requirements, "hell or high water" provisions, and risk allocation for antitrust failure.

Out - Final answer: Potential regulatory compliance issues under antitrust law in complex merger agreements (such as airline mergers) include:
- HSR Act and pre-merger notification: The parties must file under the Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Antitrust Improvements Act and wait for clearance, typically from the U.S. 
Department of Justice or Federal Trade Commission.
- Condition Precedent for Antitrust/Regulatory Approval: The merger closing is conditioned on receipt of all required antitrust and other material regulatory approvals.
- 'Hell or High Water' or Efforts Covenants: The agreement may require parties to use reasonable/best efforts (or go further, requiring all necessary steps) to secure regulatory
clearance, including offering remedies.
- Divestitures and Remedies: The agreement may set limits on what remedies (such as asset sales or conduct restrictions) a party must accept to gain antitrust approval.
- Risk allocation for Antitrust Failure: The agreement will specify what happens if antitrust approval is denied, including possible termination fees ('reverse break fees').
- Interim Conduct Covenants: Parties are typically restricted in how they coordinate their business prior to closing, to avoid 'gun-jumping' under antitrust law.
- Cooperation and Information Sharing: Provisions for sharing non-privileged information relevant to regulatory reviews, but ensuring information exchanges do not violate 
antitrust laws.
- Material Adverse Effect Definition: If adverse regulatory action is likely or occurs, it may constitute a Material Adverse Effect, allowing a party to walk away.
- Remedies/Decision Split: Who controls strategy and remedies in the face of regulator demands (usually the acquirer, but with limits).

In practice, such agreements are closely scrutinized by the DOJ, especially in concentrated industries like airlines, for potential impacts on price, service, and competition in
overlapping routes. Failure to address these antitrust risks in the agreement can delay or block closing, trigger termination rights, or force costly concessions.
