Thought: The search results show that both democracy and republic relate to government by the people. However, a democracy is defined as a system in which power is vested in the
people, either directly or through freely elected representatives. A republic, on the other hand, is a form of government in which the state is ruled by representatives elected 
by the citizen body, and often emphasizes the protection of individual and minority rights under a constitution.

Out - Final answer: A democracy is a system of government where power is vested in the people, either directly or through elected representatives. It focuses broadly on majority
rule and the participation of citizens in political decision-making. A republic is a form of government in which the country is considered a 'public matter' and the head of 
state is an elected or appointed official, not a monarch. In a republic, representatives elected by the people govern according to a constitution that limits majority power and 
protects individual rights. In practice, many countries (like the United States) are both democracies and republics—they have elected representatives and constitutional 
protections.
