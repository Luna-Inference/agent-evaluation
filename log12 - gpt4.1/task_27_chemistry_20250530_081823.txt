Thought: To answer this, I need to explain the SN2 mechanism, including how it works (single-step, concerted, backside attack), and then discuss how this affects the            
stereochemistry of the product (inversion of configuration, stereospecificity). I will retrieve a relevant explanation and likely include a description of the stereochemical    
outcome in terms of "Walden inversion." First, I'll search the web for an authoritative summary of the SN2 mechanism and its stereochemical consequences.

So for our final product we now have an OH attached to our carbon chain. In this video we're going to look at the stereo specificity of the SN2 reaction. And that just means 
that the stereochemistry of the reactant determines the stereochemistry of the product. For example if we look at our substrate, we know that this carbon is a chiral center.

SN2 is a bimolecular reaction whose rate depends on the concentrations of both the substrate and the nucleophile. SN2 reaction occurs via a concerted mechanism, meaning that all
happens in one step and no intermediates are formed. Reaction proceeds with the inversion of stereochemistry due to the backside attack of the nucleophile on our substrate.

Thought: Based on the search results, I have detailed information about the SN2 mechanism and its stereochemical outcome. The SN2 mechanism is single-step and concerted,        
involving a backside attack by the nucleophile that leads to inversion of configuration at the stereocenter—often referred to as "Walden inversion." The product therefore has   
the opposite stereochemistry compared to the starting material if the reaction center is chiral.

Out - Final answer: The SN2 (bimolecular nucleophilic substitution) mechanism occurs in a single step, where the nucleophile attacks the electrophilic carbon from the side 
opposite to the leaving group (backside attack). This leads to a concerted transition state where bonds are simultaneously made and broken. As a result, if the carbon center 
undergoing substitution is a stereocenter, the configuration of the product is inverted compared to the starting material—a process called Walden inversion. Therefore, the SN2 
reaction is stereospecific and always produces an inverted stereochemistry at the reaction center.
