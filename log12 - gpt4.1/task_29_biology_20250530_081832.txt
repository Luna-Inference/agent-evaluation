Thought: To answer this task, I need to explain what cellular respiration is and provide a brief description of its three main stages. I'll use my knowledge to compose a clear,

Cellular respiration is the process by which cells convert glucose (or other organic molecules) and oxygen into energy (ATP), carbon dioxide, and water. This process occurs in  
both plant and animal cells and is essential for providing energy for various cellular activities.                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The three main stages of cellular respiration are:                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Glycolysis: This stage takes place in the cytoplasm of the cell. Glucose is broken down into two molecules of pyruvate, producing a small amount of ATP and NADH (an electron 
carrier).                                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. Krebs Cycle (Citric Acid Cycle): This stage occurs in the mitochondria. The pyruvate molecules are further broken down, releasing carbon dioxide and transferring electrons to
NADH and FADH2 (another electron carrier). A small amount of ATP is produced.                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3. Electron Transport Chain (ETC): This final stage also takes place in the mitochondria. The electrons from NADH and FADH2 are transferred through a series of proteins,        
resulting in the production of a large amount of ATP. Oxygen acts as the final electron acceptor and combines with hydrogen ions to form water.                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
In summary, cellular respiration efficiently converts the energy stored in glucose into usable cellular energy (ATP) through glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the electron       
transport chain.
