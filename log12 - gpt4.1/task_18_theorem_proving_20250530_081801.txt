Thought: To prove that there are infinitely many prime numbers using Euclid's theorem, I will need to clearly explain a proof by contradiction. Let me outline and format the    
classic proof, then present this as my final answer with a clear logical flow.

Proof (by contradiction, following Euclid's argument):                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Assume there are only finitely many primes, say p₁, p₂, ..., pₙ.                                                                                                              
2. Consider the number N = p₁ × p₂ × ... × pₙ + 1.                                                                                                                               
3. N is greater than 1. It is either prime or composite:                                                                                                                         
   - If N is prime, then N is not in the list {p₁, ..., pₙ}, contradicting the assumption that these are all the primes.                                                         
   - If N is composite, then some prime p divides N, but every prime on the list divides p₁ × p₂ × ... × pₙ and so leaves a remainder 1 when dividing N. Thus, no pᵢ divides N,  
again a contradiction.                                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Therefore, the assumption that there are only finitely many prime numbers must be false. Thus, there are infinitely many primes.

Out - Final answer: 
Euclid's Theorem: There are infinitely many prime numbers.

Proof (by contradiction, following Euclid's argument):

1. Assume there are only finitely many primes, say p₁, p₂, ..., pₙ.
2. Consider the number N = p₁ × p₂ × ... × pₙ + 1.
3. N is greater than 1. It is either prime or composite:
   - If N is prime, then N is not in the list {p₁, ..., pₙ}, contradicting the assumption that these are all the primes.
   - If N is composite, then some prime p divides N, but every prime on the list divides p₁ × p₂ × ... × pₙ and so leaves a remainder 1 when dividing N. Thus, no pᵢ divides N, 
again a contradiction.

Therefore, the assumption that there are only finitely many prime numbers must be false. Thus, there are infinitely many primes.
