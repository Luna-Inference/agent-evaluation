Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) risk factors and the pathological changes leading to the perpetuation of insulin dysfunction. Complex combinations of genetic, metabolic and 
environmental factors that interact with one another constitute both non-modifiable (ethnicity and family history/genetic predisposition) and modifiable risk factors (obesity, 
low physical activity and an unhealthy diet).

Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), one of the most common metabolic disorders, is caused by a combination of two primary factors: defective insulin secretion by pancreatic β-cells
and the inability of insulin-sensitive tissues to respond appropriately to insulin. Because insulin release and activity a …

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by persistent hyperglycemia. It may be due to impaired insulin secretion, resistance to peripheral actions 
of insulin, or both. According to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), approximately 415 million adults between the ages of 20 to 79 years had diabetes mellitus in 
2015.[1] DM is proving to be a global public ...

Accounting for about 90-95 % of diabetes cases, type 2 diabetes (T2D) is the most common form of diabetes, especially in older adults. However, its incidence is increasing in 
children and young adults, mainly attributed to obesity, sedentary lifestyle, inadequate diet [5, 9, 10], and many other genetic, lifestyle, and environmental factors.In T2D, 
hyperglycemia initially emerges due to the ...

INTRODUCTION. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is characterized by hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and relative impairment in insulin secretion. Although the diagnostic criteria rely
solely on measures of elevated glycemia without explicit knowledge of the underlying pathophysiology, type 2 diabetes is a heterogeneous disease with patients experiencing 
varying contributions of defective insulin ...

Out - Final answer: The pathophysiology of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) involves two major abnormalities: 1) Insulin resistance—where the body's cells (mainly in muscle, fat,
and liver) become less responsive to insulin, resulting in decreased glucose uptake and increased glucose production by the liver, and 2) Relative impairment in insulin 
secretion—progressive dysfunction of pancreatic β-cells leads to insufficient insulin output to compensate for the body's needs. These changes result in persistent 
hyperglycemia. Obesity, genetic susceptibility, and environmental factors contribute to both insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction.
