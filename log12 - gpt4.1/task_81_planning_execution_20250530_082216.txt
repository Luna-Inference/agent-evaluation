Thought: To create a step-by-step plan, I first need to know the main components involved in organizing a surprise birthday party for 20 people. These usually include: venue,   
food and drinks, decorations, invitations, entertainment, and cake. For each of these, I should suggest budget-conscious steps, and estimate costs to stay within the $500       
budget. I’ll also want to ensure each step is actionable and clear. Let me outline the main steps, then break them down with cost estimates.
