[What Happens If You Mix an Acid and a Base? - ThoughtCo](https://www.thoughtco.com/mixing-acid-and-base-reaction-603654)
Understanding the Acid-Base Chemical Reaction . First, it helps to understand what acids and bases are. Acids are chemicals with a pH less than 7 that can donate a proton or H +
ion in a reaction. Bases have a pH greater than 7 and can accept a proton or produce an OH-ion in a reaction. If you mix equal amounts of a strong acid and a strong base, the 
two chemicals essentially cancel each other ...

[What Happens When An Acid & A Base Are Combined?](https://www.sciencing.com/happens-acid-base-combined-5132830/)
An examination of the chemistry of acids and bases reveals what happens when the two are combined. Acids are substances that generate positively charged ions when dissolved in 
aqueous (water-based solvent) solution. For instance, when hydrogen chloride (HCl) is dissolved in water, hydronium ions (H3O+) are released and hydrochloric acid is formed. 
These positively charged ions have ...

What happens during an acid-base reaction? An acid-base reaction is a type of chemical reaction that involves the exchange of one or more hydrogen ions, ... When mixed, acids 
and bases neutralize one another and produce salts, substances with a salty taste and none of the characteristic properties of either acids or bases.

_Bases)
Salt solutions do not always have a pH of 7, however. Through a process known as hydrolysis, the ions produced when an acid and base combine may react with the water molecules 
to produce a solution that is slightly acidic or basic. As a general concept, if a strong acid is mixed with a weak base, the resulting solution will be slightly acidic.

If we mix equal amounts of an acid and a base then two chemicals essentially cancel out each other and produce salt and water. Mixing equal amounts of a strong acid with strong 
base results in a neutral solution whose pH value remains 7 and this type of reactions are known as neutralization reactions.

[What happens when acids and bases mix? - Let's Talk Science](https://letstalkscience.ca/educational-resources/hands-on-activities/what-happens-when-acids-and-bases-mix)
Many common household substances are acids or bases, as are many of the foods we eat. In foods, the amount of acid/base affects the taste of the food, including which foods 
taste good together. Foods that taste sour contain acids; those that taste bitter often contain bases.

When you added the baking soda (a base) to the vinegar (acid) another chemical reaction took place. The bubbles that you saw when the mixture was heating was the carbon dioxide 
giving off as part of the chemical reaction turning the milk lumps or curds into a sticky, paste glue.

Before mixing anything together, dip a piece of pH paper inside each solution to check the pH of each. Take medicine dropper and draw up 10 drops of milk and 10 drops of liquidy
egg whites. Be sure to rinse the dropper in between solutions if you are using only one to prevent contamination. Mix these solutions together well.

[[FREE] What happens when you mix a strong acid and a strong base ...](https://brainly.com/question/53232820)
When you mix a strong acid and a strong base, a chemical reaction called neutralization occurs. In this process, the strong acid donates hydrogen ions (H+) and the strong base 
donates hydroxide ions (OH-). These ions react together to form water (H₂O) and a salt, which is a compound made from the cation of the base and the anion of the acid.

[Acid-Base Reactions - Chemistry 
LibreTexts](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/General_Chemistry/General_Chemistry_Supplement_(Eames)/Chemical_Reactions_and_Interactions/Acid-Base_Reactions)
In general, bases react with hydrogen ions. This is how neutralization happens. The acid produces hydrogen ions, and the base produces hydroxide ions. These react together to 
make water. The anion that came from the acid and the cation are left, so if you evaporate the water, you would get a salt. The general reaction looks like this:
