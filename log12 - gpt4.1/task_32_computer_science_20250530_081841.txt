Thought: I know that depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS) are both algorithms used for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. I will provide a
structured comparison between the two, summarizing their main differences.                                                                                                       
Code:

Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) are two fundamental algorithms used to traverse or search in trees or graphs. Here are the key differences:              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Traversal Order:                                                                                                                                                              
   - DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It goes deep into the graph/tree from the starting node before exploring siblings.                   
   - BFS explores all neighbors of a node before moving to the next level of nodes. It visits all nodes at the current depth level before going deeper.                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. Data Structure Used:                                                                                                                                                          
   - DFS typically utilizes a stack data structure (either explicitly with a stack, or implicitly via recursion).                                                                
   - BFS uses a queue data structure to keep track of nodes to visit next.                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3. Applications:                                                                                                                                                                 
   - DFS is useful for tasks like finding a path between two nodes, topological sorting, and solving puzzles with only one solution.                                             
   - BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path (in unweighted graphs), and situations where you need to examine nodes in increasing order of their distance from the source. 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
4. Memory Usage:                                                                                                                                                                 
   - DFS tends to use less memory in graphs where the solution is far from the root, since it only stores a single path from the root to the leaf node.                          
   - BFS may use more memory as it stores all nodes at the current layer (especially in wide graphs).                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
5. Example:                                                                                                                                                                      
   - DFS order (tree): Root → Left → Left’s Left … (deepest path first)

  Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) are two fundamental algorithms used to traverse or search in trees or graphs. Here are the key differences:            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  1. Traversal Order:                                                                                                                                                            
     - DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It goes deep into the graph/tree from the starting node before exploring siblings.                 
     - BFS explores all neighbors of a node before moving to the next level of nodes. It visits all nodes at the current depth level before going deeper.                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  2. Data Structure Used:

     - BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path (in unweighted graphs), and situations where you need to examine nodes in increasing order of their distance from the       
  source.

     - DFS tends to use less memory in graphs where the solution is far from the root, since it only stores a single path from the root to the leaf node.                        
     - BFS may use more memory as it stores all nodes at the current layer (especially in wide graphs).

Out - Final answer: 
Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) are two fundamental algorithms used to traverse or search in trees or graphs. Here are the key differences:

1. Traversal Order:
   - DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It goes deep into the graph/tree from the starting node before exploring siblings.
   - BFS explores all neighbors of a node before moving to the next level of nodes. It visits all nodes at the current depth level before going deeper.

2. Data Structure Used:
   - DFS typically utilizes a stack data structure (either explicitly with a stack, or implicitly via recursion).
   - BFS uses a queue data structure to keep track of nodes to visit next.

3. Applications:
   - DFS is useful for tasks like finding a path between two nodes, topological sorting, and solving puzzles with only one solution.
   - BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path (in unweighted graphs), and situations where you need to examine nodes in increasing order of their distance from the source.

4. Memory Usage:
   - DFS tends to use less memory in graphs where the solution is far from the root, since it only stores a single path from the root to the leaf node.
   - BFS may use more memory as it stores all nodes at the current layer (especially in wide graphs).

5. Example:
   - DFS order (tree): Root → Left → Left’s Left … (deepest path first)
   - BFS order (tree): Root → Left → Right → Left’s children → Right’s children (level by level)
