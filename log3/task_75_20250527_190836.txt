<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking who the author of 'To Kill a Mockingbird' is. I need to figure out how to find this information. Let me think about the tools available.                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I remember that in the previous examples, the assistant used tools like web_search and visit_webpage. So maybe I can use web_search here. The query would be "author of To
Kill a Mockingbird". Let me check if that's the right approach.                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the user might want the answer directly, so I should perform a search and then retrieve the result. The tool web_search is available, so I'll use that. The code would be  
something like:                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
web_search(query="author of To Kill a Mockingbird")                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Then, once I get the result, I can print it and finally answer the question. But according to the rules, I need to make sure not to use any new variables except those defined.  
Also, the answer should be in the final_answer function.                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So the steps are: call web_search with the query, get the result, and then use final_answer to present the answer. Let me write the code accordingly.                            
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the author of 'To Kill a Mockingbird' and then return the final answer.                                                          
Code:
