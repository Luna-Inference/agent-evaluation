<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, I need to find out the main ingredient in hákarl. First, I should figure out what hákarl is. From what I know, hákarl is a traditional Icelandic
drink. It's made from fermented mare's milk, right? But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should verify this.                                            
                                                                                                                                                      
I should use the web search tool to look up the ingredients of hákarl. Let me check the internet. The search should return information about the      
ingredients. The main ingredient is likely mare's milk, but I need to confirm. There might be other ingredients like yeast or sugar, but the primary  
one is milk.                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the user wants the main ingredient. So after searching, I can extract that information. Let me write a code snippet to perform the web search   
and then process the results to find the main ingredient.
