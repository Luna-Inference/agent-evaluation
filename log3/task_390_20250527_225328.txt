<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Serbia. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have.                             
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I can use the web search tool to look up the capital of Serbia. The web_search function would be appropriate here. The query should be "capital
of Serbia". Let me check the tools again. The web_search function takes a query string and returns the top results.                                   
                                                                                                                                                      
I'll call web_search with the query "capital of Serbia". Then, I can parse the results to find the capital. But wait, the tools don't have a specific 
function for extracting information from search results. So maybe the web_search returns a string that contains the answer directly.                  
                                                                                                                                                      
Alternatively, maybe the answer is straightforward. If the web_search returns a sentence like "The capital of Serbia is Belgrade.", then I can extract
that. But since the tools don't have a specific parser, I have to assume that the search result will contain the answer.                              
                                                                                                                                                      
So, I'll proceed by calling web_search with the query, then check the result. If the result contains the capital, I can return it. If not, maybe I    
need to try another approach. But given the tools available, this is the best approach.                                                               
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the web search tool to find the capital of Serbia.
