<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Russia. I need to find that out. Let me think about the tools I have. There's the wiki tool, which can be used to look up            
information. Also, web search tools. Since the question is straightforward, maybe using the wiki tool would be best.                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the wiki tool's query is "current pope age" in the example, but here the question is about the capital. So I should use the wiki tool with the query "capital of Russia".  
Let me check if that's possible. The tool's documentation says it's for general knowledge questions. So I'll proceed.                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll call the wiki function with the query "capital of Russia". Then, the result should give the answer. Once I get the result, I can print it and use the final_answer tool to  
present the answer.

Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Russia. Earlier, I tried using the wiki tool but got an error because the function wasn't allowed. Now I need to find another way to 
get the answer.                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Since the wiki tool isn't working, maybe I can use web search. The web_search function can look up information. I'll try searching for "capital of Russia" using the web_search  
tool. Then, I can extract the answer from the search results.                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I should check the search results to confirm the capital. Once I have the answer, I can use the final_answer tool to provide the result. Let me proceed with the web search.

Okay, so the user asked for the capital of Russia. I tried using the wiki tool but got an error because the function wasn't allowed. Then I tried the web_search tool, which     
returned results mentioning Moscow as the capital. The observation shows that the web search returned multiple sources confirming Moscow as the capital. The code printed        
"Capital of Russia: Moscow" from the search results. Since the web search tool was successful, I can now confidently answer the question with the information retrieved.
