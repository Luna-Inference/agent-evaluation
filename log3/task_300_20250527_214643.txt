<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of East Timor. Let me think about how to approach this.                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I need to recall what I know about East Timor. From what I remember, East Timor is a country in Southeast Asia, and its capital is Dili. But I should verify this to make 
sure there's no recent changes or confusion. However, since the user is probably looking for the current information, I should check a reliable source.                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the tools available include web search and wiki. So I can use the web_search function to look up the capital of East Timor. Let me structure the code to perform a web     
search with the query "capital of East Timor".                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll call the web_search function with the query parameter set to "capital of East Timor". The result should return the top search results, which likely include the capital.    
Then, I can extract the information from the search results and present it as the final answer.                                                                                  
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the capital of East Timor.
