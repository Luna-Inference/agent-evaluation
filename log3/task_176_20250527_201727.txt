<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking who discovered the planet Neptune. Let me think about how to approach this.                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I need to find the answer. Since I can use web search tools, I should perform a search to get the information. The tools available are web_search and visit_webpage. Let  
me use the web_search function with the query "who discovered Neptune".                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the user might expect a direct answer. But I should make sure to get the correct information. Let me check the search results. The top result might mention that Neptune   
was discovered by Johann Gottfried Galle. But I need to confirm.                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Alternatively, maybe there's a need to visit a specific webpage. But since the web_search function returns the top results, I can process that. Once I get the answer, I can use 
the final_answer tool to present it.                                                                                                                                             
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the answer about who discovered Neptune.
