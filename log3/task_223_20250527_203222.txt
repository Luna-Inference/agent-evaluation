<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the main ingredient in fajitas. Let me think about how to approach this.                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I need to recall what fajitas are. Fajitas are a type of Mexican dish, typically made with tortilla chips, but the main ingredients are the tortillas and the meat. The   
meat is usually cooked in a pan with onions, garlic, and chili. So the main ingredients would be the tortillas and the meat. But maybe the user wants the primary component,     
which is the meat. Wait, but the tortillas are also a key part. Let me check if there's a standard answer.                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Since I can't perform a web search here, I need to rely on my existing knowledge. The main ingredients are tortillas and the meat, which is typically cooked in a pan with       
onions, garlic, and chili. The tortillas are the main part, but the meat is also a major component. However, the question asks for the main ingredient, so perhaps the tortillas 
are the main one. But sometimes the meat is considered the main ingredient. Hmm.                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Alternatively, maybe the main ingredient is the tortilla chips, but that's a part of the dish. Wait, the question is about the main ingredient in fajitas. The standard          
ingredients are tortillas, meat (like chicken or steak), and sometimes vegetables. So the main ingredients are the tortillas and the meat. But the user might be looking for the 
primary component, which is the meat. However, the tortillas are also essential. I need to decide which one is more correct.                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
In many contexts, the tortillas are considered the main part of the dish, but the meat is also a major component. Since the question is about the main ingredient, maybe the     
answer is tortillas. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check if there's a standard answer. For example, in some sources, the main ingredients are tortillas and the meat. But    
perhaps the tortillas are the main part. Alternatively, the meat is the main ingredient. I need to make a decision here.                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Given that the tortillas are the base of the dish, and the meat is added on top, the tortillas are the main ingredient. But the meat is also a key component. However, the       
question is about the main ingredient, so maybe the tortillas. But I'm not 100% sure. To be safe, I'll go with the tortillas as the main ingredient, but I should mention both if
possible.                                                                                                                                                                        
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I need to find the main ingredient in fajitas. The main ingredients are tortillas and the meat. Since the question asks for the main ingredient, I'll identify the      
primary component, which is the tortillas. However, the meat is also essential. To confirm, I'll use the `wiki` tool to verify the standard ingredients.

Okay, the user is asking for the main ingredient in fajitas. My initial thought was that the tortillas are the main ingredient, but I need to confirm this. However, the previous
attempt tried using the 'wiki' tool, which wasn't allowed. So I need to find another way to answer this without using external tools.                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Since I can't use the wiki tool, I'll have to rely on my existing knowledge. Fajitas are typically made with tortillas, cooked meat (like chicken or steak), and sometimes       
vegetables. The tortillas are the base, but the meat is a key component. The question asks for the main ingredient, so I should highlight the tortillas as the primary part of   
the dish. However, the meat is also crucial. To clarify, the tortillas are the main ingredient in the sense that they form the base, but the meat is the main component in terms 
of flavor and texture.                                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll proceed to answer based on this reasoning, ensuring that the tortillas are highlighted as the main ingredient.                                                              
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: Since the 'wiki' tool is not available, I'll rely on my knowledge. Fajitas primarily consist of tortillas and cooked meat. The tortillas are the main ingredient in the 
sense of the base, but the meat is the main component in terms of flavor. I'll state the tortillas as the main ingredient.
