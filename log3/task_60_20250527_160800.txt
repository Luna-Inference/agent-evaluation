Okay, the user is asking who wrote 'Hamlet'. I need to figure out how to find this information. Let me think about the tools available. The tools     
mentioned are web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer.                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I should use web_search to look up the author of Hamlet. The query should be straightforward. Maybe something like "who wrote Hamlet". I'll    
call the web_search function with that query.                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                      
Once I get the results, I need to parse them to find the answer. The results might list the author, so I'll check the first few results. If the search
returns the correct information, I can extract it. If not, maybe try a different query.                                                               
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the user might expect a specific answer, like William Shakespeare. But I should make sure. Let me execute the search and then check the results.
If the web_search returns the correct author, I can use final_answer to present it. If not, perhaps there's a mistake in the search terms.            
                                                                                                                                                      
I should also consider if there are any other possible authors, but typically, Hamlet is attributed to Shakespeare. However, to be thorough, I'll use 
the web_search tool and then check the results.                                                                                                       
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the author of "Hamlet" and then extract the answer from the results.                                  
Code:
