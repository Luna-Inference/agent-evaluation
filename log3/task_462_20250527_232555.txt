<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Lithuania. Let me think about how to approach this.                                                       
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I know that the capital of Lithuania is Vilnius. But maybe I should verify this using a reliable source. Since the user might want the most    
accurate answer, I should check a trusted database or a web search.                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                      
Looking at the tools available, there's a 'wiki' function that can retrieve information. So I'll use that. The query would be "capital of Lithuania". 
Let me call the wiki function with that query.                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the tools mentioned include 'wiki' and 'web_search'. The 'wiki' function might return the correct information. Let me execute the code to get   
the answer.                                                                                                                                           
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the `wiki` tool to find the capital of Lithuania.

Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Lithuania. My first thought was to use the wiki tool, but the system said that 'wiki' isn't allowed. So I 
need to find another way to get the answer without using that tool.                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                      
Since the capital of Lithuania is Vilnius, maybe I can confirm this directly. But the tools available include web_search and visit_webpage. Let me try
using web_search with the query "capital of Lithuania" to get the top result. Then I can extract the answer from the search results.                  
                                                                                                                                                      
I'll write code to perform a web search and then parse the result to find the capital. Let's see if that works.
