<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the chemical symbol of helium. I need to figure out how to get that information.                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I remember that helium is a noble gas, and its symbol is He. But maybe they want a more detailed answer, like the atomic number and other properties. However, the        
question is straightforward: the chemical symbol.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Since I can use the tools provided, maybe the best approach is to use the web search tool to look up the chemical symbol of helium. Let me check the available tools. The        
web_search function is there, which can be used to find information.                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll perform a web search for "chemical symbol for helium" to get the answer. Then, I can extract the symbol from the results. The answer should be straightforward, but I need  
to make sure the search returns the correct information.                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the user might expect the symbol He, but perhaps they want to confirm with a reliable source. Using the web_search tool with the correct query should give the accurate    
result.                                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Once I get the search results, I can parse the information to find the chemical symbol. The answer will be in the form of a string, so I can directly use it.                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I should also check if there are any other tools that could help, but given the constraints, web_search is the best option here. Let me proceed with that.
