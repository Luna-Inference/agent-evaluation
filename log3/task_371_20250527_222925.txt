Okay, the user is asking who wrote "Between the Acts." First, I need to figure out what "Between the Acts" refers to. Since it's a book title, I      
should check if it's a well-known work. Maybe it's a classic or a literary piece.                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                      
I should start by searching for the book "Between the Acts" to find the author. Using the web_search tool with the query "Between the Acts author"    
might give the answer. Let me perform that search.                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                      
Once I get the results, I can look for the author's name. If the search returns the author, I can then use the final_answer tool to present the       
result. If the search doesn't find immediate results, I might need to refine the query or check for possible variations in the title.
