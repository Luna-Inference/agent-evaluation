<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking who discovered the proton. I need to figure out how to find this information. Let me think about the tools available. The tools mentioned are           
web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer. So I can use web_search to look up the history of the proton's discovery.                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I should perform a web search to find the answer. The query should be something like "who discovered the proton". I'll use the web_search function with that query. Once I
get the results, I need to extract the relevant information. The results might include articles or websites that discuss the discovery.                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the user might want the exact name of the scientist. Let me check the search results. If the web_search returns something like "Proton was discovered by Ernest Rutherford 
in 1911", then the answer is Ernest Rutherford. But I need to make sure the information is accurate. Maybe there's a different approach if the search returns multiple sources.  
However, since the user is asking for the answer, I can proceed with the first result.                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I should also consider if there are any other contributors. For example, some sources might mention that the proton was discovered by multiple scientists, but usually, the      
primary discoverer is the main figure. In this case, Rutherford is the key figure. So the answer is Ernest Rutherford.                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Now, I'll write the code to perform the web search and then extract the answer.                                                                                                  
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the answer about who discovered the proton.

[Proton - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton)
A proton is a stable subatomic particle, symbol p, H +, or 1 H + with a positive electric charge of +1 e (elementary charge).Its mass is slightly less than the mass of a neutron
and approximately 1836 times the mass of an electron (the proton-to-electron mass ratio).Protons and neutrons, each with a mass of approximately one atomic mass unit, are 
jointly referred to as nucleons (particles ...

The neutron, however, was not discovered until 1932, when James Chadwick (1891-1974, a student of Rutherford; Nobel Prize in Physics, 1935) discovered it. As a result of 
Rutherford's work, it became clear that an α particle contains two protons and neutrons, and is therefore the nucleus of a helium atom.

The way this happened was a gradual process, and that is why it is hard to say exactly who discovered the proton, although if you had put a name against it, it would be 
Ruthford, sort of. After the discovery of the electron, it was realized that there must be positive charge centers within the atom to balance the negative electrons and create
