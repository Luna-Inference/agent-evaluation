Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Luxembourg. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have.                         
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I can use the web search tool to look up the capital of Luxembourg. The web_search function would be appropriate here. The query should be     
straightforward, like "capital of Luxembourg".                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                      
I'll call the web_search function with the query "capital of Luxembourg". Then, I'll check the results to find the answer. The top result should      
mention the capital. Once I get that information, I can present it as the final answer.
