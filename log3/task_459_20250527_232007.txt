<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Latvia. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have.                             
                                                                                                                                                      
The available tools are web_search and visit_webpage, which I can use to look up information. Since the question is straightforward, I can use a web  
search to find the answer. The capital of Latvia is Riga, but I should verify this through a search.                                                  
                                                                                                                                                      
I'll start by performing a web search for "capital of Latvia" to get the top results. Then, I can extract the information from the search results. If 
the search returns the correct answer, I can use that to form the final answer.                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the user might want the exact answer, so I need to make sure the search is precise. Let me write a code snippet that uses web_search with the   
query "capital of Latvia" and then print the result. If the result is straightforward, like stating the capital is Riga, I can directly use that in   
the final answer.                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                      
I should check if there are any other tools needed, but since the question is simple, just a web search should suffice. Let's proceed with that.      
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the capital of Latvia.
