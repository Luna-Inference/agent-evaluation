Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Bulgaria. I need to find that out. Let me think about the tools I have. There's the web_search function,  
which can look up information. Since the question is straightforward, I can use web_search with the query "capital of Bulgaria". Let me check if      
there's any other tool needed, but the instructions say to use the available tools. The capital of Bulgaria is Sofia, but I should verify using the   
search tool to make sure. Let me write the code to perform the search and then return the answer.
