Okay, the user is asking for the chemical symbol of mercury. Let me think about how to approach this.                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I know that mercury is a chemical element. The periodic table lists its symbol. From what I remember, mercury's symbol is Hg. But I should verify this to be sure. Maybe I
can use the web search tool to check the exact symbol.                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So, I'll use the web_search function with the query "chemical symbol for mercury". That should return the correct information. Once I get the result, I can extract the symbol   
and provide the answer.                                                                                                                                                          
</think>
