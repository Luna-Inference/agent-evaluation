<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of India. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have.                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The available tools are web_search and visit_webpage, but the user hasn't provided specific tools for this. Wait, in the previous examples, the assistant used web_search and    
visit_webpage. So maybe I should use web_search here.                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The query is straightforward: "capital of India". Let me perform a web search for that. The web_search function will return the top results. Then, I can extract the capital from
the first result.                                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the user's task is to provide the answer, so after getting the search results, I need to parse them. But how? The web_search function returns a string, which I can check  
for the capital. For example, if the first result says "India's capital is New Delhi", then the answer is New Delhi.                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So the steps are: call web_search with "capital of India", then check the result to find the capital. Then use final_answer to return it.                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I should write code that does that. Let me structure it.                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, perform the web search. Then, process the result to find the capital. Then, output the answer.                                                                            
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the capital of India and then extract the answer from the search results.
