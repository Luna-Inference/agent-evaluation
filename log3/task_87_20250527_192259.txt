<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the chemical formula of table salt. I remember that table salt is commonly known as sodium chloride. Let me think about the elements involved.      
Sodium (Na) is a metal, and chlorine (Cl) is a non-metal. In compounds, metals tend to lose electrons and non-metals gain them, so sodium would lose an electron to chlorine,    
forming Na+ and Cl- ions. To balance the charges, one sodium ion combines with one chloride ion, resulting in NaCl. So the formula should be NaCl.                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
But wait, maybe I should verify this. I can use the web search tool to check if there's any more details or if there's a different formula. Let me perform a web search for      
"chemical formula of table salt".                                                                                                                                                
</think>
