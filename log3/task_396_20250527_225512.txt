<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Montenegro. Let me think about how to approach this.                                                      
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I need to recall if I have any existing knowledge about Montenegro's capital. From what I remember, Montenegro's capital is Podgorica. But I   
should verify this to make sure. However, since the tools available include web search and wiki, I can use those to confirm.                          
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the tools provided are web_search and wiki. So I should use web_search to look up the capital of Montenegro. The query would be something like  
"capital of Montenegro". Let me check the tools again. The web_search function takes a query string and returns the top results. So I can call        
web_search with the query "capital of Montenegro".                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                      
Alternatively, maybe the wiki tool can also be used. But since the user hasn't specified any particular tool preference, I'll go with web_search to   
get the most up-to-date information. Once I get the result, I can extract the capital from the search results and return it as the final answer.
