<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking who wrote "The Sun Also Rises." Let me think about how to approach this.                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I need to find the author of the novel. Since I can use web search tools, I should perform a search to find the author. The tool available is web_search, so I'll use that
with the query "The Sun Also Rises author."                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll write a code snippet that uses the web_search function with the appropriate query. Then, I'll check the results to determine the author. If the search returns the author's 
name, I can finalize the answer with the final_answer tool.                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Let me make sure the code is correct. The query should be straightforward, just the book title. The tool will return the top results, which I can then parse to get the author's 
name. If the search returns the author's name, I'll present that as the answer.                                                                                                  
</think>
