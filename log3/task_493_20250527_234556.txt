<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking about the main component of natural gas. Let me think. Natural gas is primarily methane, right? But I should verify this. I  
need to check a reliable source or use a tool to confirm.                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I'll use the web search tool to look up the composition of natural gas. The query should be something like "main component of natural gas". Let
me perform the search and get the top results. Then, I can extract the information from the results.                                                  
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the tools available are web_search and visit_webpage. So I'll call web_search with the query. Once I get the results, I'll parse them to find   
the answer. If the search returns something like "Natural gas is primarily composed of methane (CH4)", then the answer is methane. But I need to make 
sure the information is accurate. If there's any other component mentioned, like ethane or other gases, I should note that. But the main component is 
generally methane.

Okay, so the user asked, "What is the main component of natural gas?" Based on the web search results, natural gas is mainly methane. The search      
results from the EIA, Britannica, Wikipedia, and other sources all mention that natural gas is primarily methane, with smaller amounts of other       
hydrocarbons like ethane, propane, butane, and even trace amounts of nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and helium. However, the main component is clearly     
methane.                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
The code executed a web search and retrieved the results. The observation shows that the main component is methane, as stated in multiple sources.    
Even though there are other gases present, methane is the primary one. Therefore, the answer is methane.
