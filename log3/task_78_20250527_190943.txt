Okay, the user is asking for the currency of Japan. I need to figure out what the answer is. From what I remember, Japan uses the yen as their primary currency. But maybe I     
should verify this with some reliable source.                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Hmm, the tools available include web search and wiki. Let me use the web_search function to check the current currency. The query should be "currency of Japan". Let me run that.
</think>
