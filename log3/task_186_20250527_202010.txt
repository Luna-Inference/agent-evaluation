Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Iceland. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have. The available tools are web_search, visit_webpage, and
final_answer. Since the question is straightforward, I can use the web_search function with the query "capital of Iceland". Let me check if there's any need to visit a specific 
webpage. Maybe the search will return the top result directly. I'll execute the search and then retrieve the answer from the results. If the search returns the capital directly,
I can print it and use the final_answer tool to provide the answer. If not, I might need to visit a webpage to fetch the information. But given that the question is simple, the 
web_search should suffice. Let me write the code.
