Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Slovakia. Let me think about how to approach this.                                                        
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I know that the capital of Slovakia is Bratislava. But maybe I should verify this using a reliable source. Since the user might want the most  
accurate answer, using a web search would be a good idea. However, the available tools include web_search and visit_webpage. Let me check if I can use
web_search here.                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                      
The task is straightforward: find the capital of Slovakia. So I can use the web_search function with the query "capital of Slovakia". The result      
should give the answer directly. Once I get the result, I can extract the capital from it and return it as the final answer.                          
                                                                                                                                                      
I need to make sure that the web_search returns the correct information. If the search returns the correct result, then the answer is Bratislava. If  
not, maybe I need to check another source, but according to the tools provided, web_search is the way to go here.                                     
                                                                                                                                                      
So the steps are: perform a web search for "capital of Slovakia", extract the answer from the results, and then use final_answer to present it.
