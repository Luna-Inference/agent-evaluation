<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Croatia. Let me think about how to approach this.                                                         
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I know that the capital of Croatia is Zagreb. But maybe I should verify this using a reliable source. Since the user might want the most       
accurate answer, I should use a web search to confirm.                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                      
I can use the web_search tool to look up the capital of Croatia. The query would be something like "capital of Croatia". Let me check the results. If 
the search returns Zagreb as the capital, then I can be confident in that answer.                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                      
Alternatively, if there's a different result, I might need to cross-reference. But given that Zagreb is the well-known capital of Croatia, this should
be straightforward.                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                      
So the steps would be: perform a web search for the capital of Croatia, retrieve the answer, and then present it as the final answer.
