Okay, the user is asking about the main ingredient in köttbullar. First, I need to figure out what köttbullar are. From what I know, köttbullar are   
Swedish meatballs. They're typically made with a mix of ground meat, sometimes including pork or beef, along with vegetables like onions, carrots, and
celery. The sauce is usually a blend of milk, flour, and sometimes egg. But I need to confirm this.                                                   
                                                                                                                                                      
Since the user is asking for the main ingredient, I should check reliable sources. The tool 'wiki' can be used to look up information about           
köttbullar. Let me use the wiki tool to get the details. If the wiki returns the ingredients, I can extract the main one. If not, maybe a web search  
would help. But first, let's try the wiki tool.

Thought: I will use the `wiki` tool to find the ingredients of köttbullar and determine the main ingredient.

Okay, the user is asking about the main ingredient in köttbullar. I tried using the wiki tool but got an error because the function wasn't allowed.   
Let me think of another way to find the answer.                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                      
Since I can't use the wiki tool, maybe I can search online directly. The web search tool is allowed. I'll use that to look up the ingredients of      
köttbullar. Let's check the top results for "köttbullar ingredients" to find the main component.                                                      
                                                                                                                                                      
I need to make sure the search is accurate. The main ingredients are usually a mix of ground meat, vegetables, and a sauce. The main ingredient would 
be the primary meat component. Let me perform the search and analyze the results.
