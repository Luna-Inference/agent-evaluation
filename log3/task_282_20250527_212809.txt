Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Vietnam. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have available. The tools include web search, visiting      
webpages, and final answer. Since the question is straightforward, I can use the web_search function to look up the capital of Vietnam.                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I'll use the web_search tool with the query "capital of Vietnam". The result should give me the answer directly. Once I get the result, I can extract the capital from the
search results. Then, I'll use the final_answer tool to present the answer.
