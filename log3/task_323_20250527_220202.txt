<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking who wrote "A Farewell to Arms." Let me think about how to approach this.                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I need to find the author of the book. Since I can use web search, I should perform a search for the book's title. The title is "A Farewell to Arms," so I'll use the     
web_search tool with that query.                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Once I get the search results, I need to parse them to find the author. The results might mention the author directly. If the search returns the author's name, I can extract    
that information. If not, maybe the search results have more context, like the publication year or other details.                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, I should check if there's a specific tool for this. The available tools are web_search and visit_webpage. Since the user wants the author, a web search should suffice. Let
me execute the search first.                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So the code would be something like using web_search with the query "A Farewell to Arms author". Then, based on the results, determine the author. If the search returns the     
author's name, that's the answer. If not, maybe the results have more details. But since the user is asking for the author, the search should directly provide that information. 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I need to make sure the query is accurate. Using "A Farewell to Arms author" should return the correct result. Let's proceed with that.                                          
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the author of "A Farewell to Arms."
