Okay, the user is asking who the author of 'Don Quixote' is. I need to figure out how to find this information. Let me think about the tools available.                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I remember that in the previous examples, the assistant used tools like web_search and wiki. So maybe I can use web_search here. The query would be something like "author
of Don Quixote". Let me check if that's straightforward.                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the user might expect a direct answer. But sometimes, the web search might return multiple results. I should make sure to get the correct author. Let me try the search.   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So the code would be something like:                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
pope_age_wiki = wiki(query="current pope age")                                                                                                                                   
print("Pope age as per wikipedia:", pope_age_wiki)                                                                                                                               
pope_age_search = web_search(query="current pope age")                                                                                                                           
print("Pope age as per google search:", pope_age_search)                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
But for this task, it's about Don Quixote. So the query should be "author of Don Quixote". Let me adjust the code accordingly.                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the user is asking for the author, so the web search should return the author's name. Let me write the code:                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
web_search("author of Don Quixote")                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
But I need to make sure that the search returns the correct result. If the search returns the author's name, then I can proceed. If not, maybe I need to refine the query. But   
since this is a straightforward question, the search should give the answer.                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So the code would be:                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Code:                                                                                                                                                                            
```py

```                                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
But I need to check if the web_search returns the correct information. If the search returns something like "Miguel de Cervantes", then that's the answer. Otherwise, maybe      
there's a need to adjust the query. But given that this is a common question, the search should work.
