<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, I need to find out who wrote the book "Silas Marner". Let me think about how to approach this.                                                  
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I should check if there's a tool available to look up book authors. The user mentioned tools like wiki, web_search, and others. Maybe the      
web_search tool can be used here. The question is straightforward, so a web search should find the answer.                                            
                                                                                                                                                      
I'll use the web_search function with the query "who wrote Silas Marner". The result should give the author's name. Once I get the answer, I can      
present it as the final answer.                                                                                                                       
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the author of "Silas Marner".
