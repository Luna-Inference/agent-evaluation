Okay, the user is asking who discovered the law of conservation of momentum in quantum mechanics. Let me think about how to approach this.            
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I need to recall what the law of conservation of momentum states. In classical mechanics, it's Newton's third law, where forces between systems
are equal and opposite, leading to conservation of momentum. But in quantum mechanics, the concept is slightly different. However, the question       
specifically mentions quantum mechanics, so I should focus on that.                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                      
I remember that in quantum mechanics, the conservation of momentum is related to the symmetry of the system. The principle is that the total momentum 
of a closed system remains constant over time. But who actually discovered this law? Wait, in classical mechanics, it's Newton, but in quantum        
mechanics, the concept is more nuanced. However, the law itself might be considered part of classical mechanics, but the question is about quantum    
mechanics.                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the user is asking about quantum mechanics. So perhaps the answer is that the law is part of classical mechanics, but in quantum mechanics, it's
still valid. However, the question is about who discovered it in quantum mechanics. Maybe the answer is that it's a fundamental principle in both     
domains, but the discovery is attributed to Newton. But I need to verify this.                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                      
Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick question, where the answer is Newton, since the law is part of classical mechanics. But the user         
specified quantum mechanics. Hmm.                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                      
I need to check if there's a specific person associated with the law in quantum mechanics. Wait, in quantum mechanics, the conservation of momentum is
derived from the symmetry of the Hamiltonian, which is related to the Heisenberg picture. But the actual discovery might be in classical mechanics.   
However, the user is asking about quantum mechanics, so perhaps the answer is that the law is part of classical mechanics, but the principle is still 
valid in quantum mechanics. The discoverer might be Newton, but the question might be looking for a different answer.                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the conservation of momentum in quantum mechanics as a result of the symmetry of the system, but the
actual law is classical. So the answer would be that the law is part of classical mechanics, but the principle is still valid in quantum mechanics.   
However, the question is about who discovered it in quantum mechanics. If the answer is that it's a classical concept, then the answer would be       
Newton. But I need to make sure.                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                      
Alternatively, maybe the question is a bit of a trick, and the answer is that the law is part of classical mechanics, so the discoverer is Newton. But
I need to confirm.                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                      
I think the correct answer is that the law of conservation of momentum is a fundamental principle in both classical and quantum mechanics, and it was 
first formulated by Isaac Newton. However, the question might be looking for a different answer. But given the information, I should proceed with     
that.                                                                                                                                                 
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I need to find the person who discovered the law of conservation of momentum in quantum mechanics. Since this is a historical question, I    
will search for relevant information. The law is foundational in both classical and quantum mechanics, but the discovery is attributed to Newton.     
However, the question specifies quantum mechanics, so I should verify if there's a specific figure associated with it in that context.
