<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking for the height of Mount Everest. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have.                       
                                                                                                                                                      
The available tools are web_search and visit_webpage. Maybe I can use web_search with the query "height of Mount Everest". Let me check if that's     
straightforward.                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the user might expect a precise answer. I should make sure to get the most recent data. Let me perform the search. If the web_search returns the
correct information, I can then present it. If not, maybe I need to visit a specific webpage. But based on the examples, using web_search with the    
query should work.                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                      
So, I'll write a code snippet that uses web_search with the query "height of Mount Everest". Then, once I get the result, I can print it and finalize 
the answer.

Okay, so the user asked for the height of Mount Everest. I used the web_search tool with the query "height of Mount Everest". The results from the    
search showed multiple sources, including Wikipedia and other geological websites. The most accurate answer mentioned that the height was finalized by
a joint Chinese-Nepalese survey in 2020 at 8,848.86 meters. The other sources sometimes gave slightly different numbers, like 8,848.86 meters,        
8,848.86 meters, and 8,848.86 meters. The key point is that the official height is 8,848.86 meters. I need to present this answer clearly. The code
