<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking who wrote 'The Odyssey'. I need to figure out how to find this information. Let me think about the tools available.          
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I remember that the user has access to a search function. In the previous examples, they used the web_search tool to find answers. So maybe I  
should use that here. The query would be something like "Who wrote The Odyssey?".                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the tools mentioned are web_search and visit_webpage. So the plan is to use web_search with the query "Who wrote The Odyssey?" to get the       
answer. Then, once I get the result, I can present it as the final answer.                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                      
I should make sure to use the correct parameters. The web_search function takes a query string. So the code would be straightforward: call web_search 
with the query, then print the result. Then, the final answer is the result of the search.                                                            
                                                                                                                                                      
I need to check if there are any other tools, but according to the rules, only web_search and visit_webpage are available. Since the user hasn't      
mentioned any other tools, I'll proceed with web_search.                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
So the code would be:                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
web_search(query="Who wrote The Odyssey?")                                                                                                            
print(web_search(query="Who wrote The Odyssey?"))                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                      
Then, the final answer is the result of that search. But since the user wants the answer in the final_answer tool, I need to make sure that the code  
correctly captures the result.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, in the previous examples, when they used web_search, they printed the results. So in this case, the code would be:                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Code:                                                                                                                                                 
```py                                                                                                                                                 
result = web_search(query="Who wrote The Odyssey?")                                                                                                   
final_answer(result)                                                                                                                                  
```                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                      
But I need to make sure that the web_search returns the correct answer. The answer should be something like "The Odyssey was written by Homer." So the
code should correctly retrieve that.                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                      
I think that's all. The steps are: use web_search to find the answer, then output it via final_answer.                                                
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the answer to the question "Who wrote The Odyssey?" and then return the result.                       
Code:
