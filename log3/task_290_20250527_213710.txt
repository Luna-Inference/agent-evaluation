<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking who discovered the law of conservation of energy. I need to figure out how to find this information. Let me think about the tools available.            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The tools mentioned are web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer. Since the question is about a historical figure and a scientific law, a web search would be the best        
approach. I can use the web_search function with the query "who discovered the law of conservation of energy".                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I should check reliable sources. Maybe the first result from the search will give the answer. Once I get the answer, I can use the final_answer tool to present it. Let me       
execute the code to perform the search.                                                                                                                                          
</think>

[James Prescott Joule | Biography & Facts | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/biography/James-Prescott-Joule)
James Prescott Joule, English physicist who established that the various forms of energy, such as electrical and heat, are basically the same and can be changed one into 
another. Thus, he formed the basis of conservation of energy, the first law of thermodynamics. Learn more about Joule's life and work.

[Conservation of energy - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_energy)
The law of conservation of energy states that the total energy of an isolated system remains constant; it is said to be conserved over time. [1] In the case of a closed system, 
the principle says that the total amount of energy within the system can only be changed through energy entering or leaving the system.

[Who Discovered the Law of Conservation of Energy? (Description)](https://thepowerfacts.com/who-discovered-the-law-of-conservation-of-energy/)
In 1845, German physician Julius Robert Mayer discovered the law of conservation of energy. This law states that energy cannot be created or destroyed.

[Law of Conservation of Energy - Science Notes and Projects](https://sciencenotes.org/law-of-conservation-of-energy/)
Learn what the law of conservation of energy is in physics and get examples in everyday life. See the formulas for the law.

[History of the first law of thermodynamics, the conservation of energy](https://solar-energy.technology/thermodynamics/laws-of-thermodynamics/first-law-thermodynamics/history)
This led to the law of conservation of energy (first law of thermodynamics). The SI power unit, July, is named after him. He developed the absolute temperature scale with Lord 
Kelvin, described magnetostriction, and found the relationship between electric current through an electrical resistance and heat dissipation, known as Joule's law.

[James Prescott Joule - Famous People in the World](https://www.thefamouspeople.com/profiles/james-prescott-joule-4856.php)
He studied the nature of heat, and discovered its relationship to mechanical work. This led to the law of conservation of energy, which led to the development of the first law 
of thermodynamics.

[The Discovery of the Law of Conservation of Energy - JSTOR](https://www.jstor.org/stable/224595)
This article explores the discovery and development of the Law of Conservation of Energy, a fundamental principle in physics.

[Joule and the Conservation of Energy - galileo.phys.virginia.edu](https://galileo.phys.virginia.edu/classes/152.mf1i.spring02/Joule.htm)
His experiments establishing the equivalence of heat and mechanical work, the cornerstone of the principle of conservation of energy, are among the greatest achievements of 
nineteenth-century science. But was Carnot so wrong?

[The discovery of the law of conservation of energy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016003230907065)
At almost the same time the discovery of a fixed numerical relation between heat and work was made by two very different men, Julius Robert Mayer (1814-1878) and James Prescott 
Joule (I818-I889). Mayer, a German physician on a Dutch.ship, dis- covered the law of conservation of energy by a sudden intuition.

[Who discovered law of conservation of energy? - MassInitiative](https://massinitiative.org/who-discovered-law-of-conservation-of-energy/)
Now familiar to engineers as the unit of energy, Joule, or James Prescott Joule discovered the law of conservation of energy and an experiment that further led to the discovery 
of the first law of thermodynamics. He was an English physicist with established work on the relationship between mechanical work and heat transfer.
