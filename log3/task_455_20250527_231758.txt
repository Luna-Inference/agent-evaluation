Okay, the user is asking who wrote the book "Brother Jacob". I need to figure out how to find this information. Let me think about the tools          
available.                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I can use a web search to look up the author of "Brother Jacob". The tools include a web search function, so I can perform a search with the   
query "Who wrote Brother Jacob?".                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                      
I should check the results to find the author. The web search tool will return the top results, and I can parse those to find the author's name. Once 
I have the answer, I can present it as the final answer.

[Brother Jacob by George Eliot - Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1835441.Brother_Jacob)
Though "Brother Jacob" is written in her usual third person, it's filled with rare but relentless humor. Whether the comedy is sardonic, sarcastic, 
ironic, satiric, or cynical I'm not altogether certain, but it's there in spades. After a while it gets a little wearying, but Eliot has the good 
sense to tone down the tone and let the situation ...

And when they wrote those documents, they would not even mention, "By the way, Jesus is my brother." James instead writes, merely, "James, a servant 
of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ" . And Jude opens with, "Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and brother of James" . Those very introductions speak 
volumes about their humility and ...

Jacob was absorbed in scratching up the earth, and had not heard David's approach. "I say, Jacob," said David in a loud whisper, just as the tin box 
was lifted out of the hole. Jacob looked up, and discerning his sweet-flavoured brother, nodded and grinned in the dim light in a way that made him 
seem to David like a triumphant demon.

Although debated by some, it is believed that the Jacob who wrote this book (also known as James the Just) was the half brother of our Lord Jesus 
referred to in Galatians 1:19 and in Mark 6:3. This is amazing to think that the actual half brother of our Lord and Savior gives us truth to live by.
