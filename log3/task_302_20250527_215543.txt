<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking who discovered the law of conservation of charge. I need to figure out how to find this information. Let me think about the tools available.            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I can use the web search tool to look up the answer. The question is straightforward, so a simple search should work. I'll call the web_search function with the query    
"who discovered the law of conservation of charge".                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Once I get the results, I'll need to parse them to find the relevant information. The results might list scientists and their contributions. The answer is likely a well-known   
figure, so the first result should be it.                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll write a code snippet to perform the search and then extract the answer from the first result. If the search returns the answer directly, I can use that. If not, I might    
need to check multiple results. But for now, let's start with the initial search.                                                                                                
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web search tool to find the answer to the question about who discovered the law of conservation of charge.
