Okay, the user is asking who discovered America. I need to figure out how to find the answer. Let me think about the tools I have.                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I remember that the user provided some tools like web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer. So maybe I can use web_search to look up the history of America's          
discovery. The question is about who discovered it, so I need to find the historical figure associated with that.                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I should start by performing a web search for "who discovered America". The tools allow me to use the web_search function with a query. The answer will be the top results from  
the search. Once I get the information, I can then use the final_answer tool to present the answer.                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the user's previous examples used the web_search function directly. So I'll construct the code by calling web_search with the query "who discovered America". Then, the    
observation will return the results, and I can parse them to find the answer. If the search returns a result like "Christopher Columbus discovered America", I can extract that  
and use final_answer to present it.                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I need to make sure that the code is correct. The code should be straightforward: call web_search with the right query, then process the result. Since the tools don't have a way
to parse the search results, I'll assume that the web_search returns the answer directly. So the code would be:                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
web_search(query="who discovered America")                                                                                                                                       
final_answer(result)                                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
But I have to make sure that the result is captured properly. In the observation, the result will be the search results, and I can then take the first relevant answer. However, 
the user's previous examples show that the code can print the result, so maybe the code is:                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Code:                                                                                                                                                                            
```py                                                                                                                                                                            
result = web_search(query="who discovered America")                                                                                                                              
final_answer(result)                                                                                                                                                             
```                                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
But I need to check if the web_search returns the answer directly. If the search returns the answer, then the final_answer can just use that. If not, maybe I need to process the
result further. But according to the tools provided, the web_search returns the top results, so I can directly use that.                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So the final code would be as above. Let me write that.                                                                                                                          
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the answer to "Who discovered America" and then return the final answer.                                                         
Code:
