Okay, the user is asking who discovered the law of conservation of momentum. I need to figure out how to find this information.                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I remember that the law of conservation of momentum is a fundamental principle in physics. It's related to Newton's laws, especially the third one. But I need to confirm 
the discoverer.                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I should start by searching for reliable sources. Since the user mentioned using tools like web_search, I can use that. The query should be straightforward: "who discovered the 
law of conservation of momentum".                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the tools available include web_search and visit_webpage. So I'll use web_search with the query. Then, I'll check the results to find the correct answer.                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Once I get the information, I can extract the name from the search results. If the search returns multiple sources, I'll need to determine the most accurate one.                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I should also consider if there's any controversy or multiple contributors. But generally, the law is attributed to Isaac Newton. However, maybe the search results mention a    
different person.                                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, in some contexts, the law is part of Newton's laws, so the discoverer is Newton himself. But maybe the search results mention another physicist. I need to verify that.    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So the steps are: perform a web search for the question, collect the results, and then extract the answer from the first relevant source. Then, present the answer in the final  
answer box.                                                                                                                                                                      
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the `web_search` tool to find the answer to the question about who discovered the law of conservation of momentum.

Okay, the user is asking who discovered the law of conservation of momentum. I need to find the answer. Previously, I tried using the `wiki` tool, but it was forbidden. So I    
need to find another way.                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Let me think. The law of conservation of momentum is part of Newton's laws. Isaac Newton is usually credited, but maybe the search results mention a different person. Since the 
`wiki` tool isn't allowed, I'll use the `web_search` tool directly with the query "who discovered the law of conservation of momentum".                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll perform a web search for this question. The results should list the discoverers. I'll check the first result and extract the name. If the search returns multiple sources,  
I'll pick the most relevant one. Finally, I'll present the answer in the final answer box.

Add those laws together and it produces the Law of Conservation of Momentum. This is where Descartes began. ... So, the question should not be "who discovered momentum" - as the
inertia of a moving object has been known for a long time. The real discovery was that there are two different types of inertia.

Sir Isaac Newton discovered the law of conservation of momentum while formulating the laws of motion. The law of conservation of momentum is a direct consequence of Newton's 
third law of motion. When two or more bodies act upon one another then in the absence of an external force, the total momentum of all bodies in the system in a particular ...

[Conservation of momentum | Definition, Examples, & Facts | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/science/conservation-of-momentum)
conservation of momentum, general law of physics according to which the quantity called momentum that characterizes motion never changes in an isolated collection of objects; 
that is, the total momentum of a system remains constant. Momentum is equal to the mass of an object multiplied by its velocity and is equivalent to the force required to bring 
the object to a stop in a unit length of time.

Equation of Conservation of Momentum The equation describing the Law of Conservation of Momentum is p=p′ , where p is the system's initial momentum and p′ is the system's final 
momentum. This equation can be expanded using the definition of momentum into m1v1+m2v2=m1v′1+m2v′2 m 1 v 1 + m 2 v 2 = m 1 v 1 ′ + m 2 v 2 ′ .

This concept is called the Law of Conservation of Mass. In a physical change, a substance's physical properties may change, but its chemical makeup does not. How does the idea 
of indivisible atoms explain the conservation of matter? The idea of indivisible atoms helps to explain the conservation of matter.

[10 Conservation of Momentum - The Feynman Lectures on Physics](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_10.html)
In addition to the law of conservation of momentum, there is another interesting consequence of Newton's Second Law, to be proved later, but merely stated now. This principle is
that the laws of physics will look the same whether we are standing still or moving with a uniform speed in a straight line.

Add those laws together and it produces the Law of Conservation of Momentum. This is where Descartes began. ... So, the question should not be "who discovered momentum" - as the inertia of a moving object has been known for a long time. The real discovery was that there are two different types of inertia.
