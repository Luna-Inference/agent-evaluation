<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Bahrain. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have.                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The available tools are web_search and visit_webpage. Since the question is straightforward, I can use web_search with the query "capital of Bahrain". The web_search function   
will return the top results. Then, I can check the first result to find the capital.                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the user might want the most recent information. So I should perform a web search and then extract the capital from the first result. Let me write the code to do that.    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, call web_search with the query. Then, parse the result to get the capital. The answer will be the first part of the search result. Let me implement that.                 
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the capital of Bahrain and then extract the answer from the first result.
