<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking who invented the telephone. I need to find the answer using the tools available. Let me think about the steps.               
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I should use the web search tool to look up the invention of the telephone. The tools provided include web_search and visit_webpage. So I'll   
perform a web search with the query "who invented the telephone".                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the user might expect the answer to be Alexander Graham Bell, but I need to confirm. Let me check the search results. If the search returns that
Bell was the inventor, then I can proceed. If not, maybe there's another person involved, like Christopher Sholes or Elisha Gray. But the most        
commonly cited inventor is Bell.                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                      
So I'll run the web search, get the top results, and then extract the information. If the search results mention Bell, I can use that. If there's a   
different name, I'll need to verify. But since the tools are limited, I'll go with the first result found.                                            
                                                                                                                                                      
Once I have the answer, I'll use the final_answer tool to present it.                                                                                 
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the inventor of the telephone and then return the final answer.
