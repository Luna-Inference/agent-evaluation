Okay, the user is asking about the main ingredient in sashimi. Let me think. Sashimi is a type of Japanese cuisine where raw fish is served without any seasoning. So the main   
ingredient would be the fish itself. But I need to confirm this.                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I should check if there's any other ingredients commonly added. But traditionally, sashimi is just the fish. However, sometimes it might include soy sauce or other       
condiments, but those are optional. The question is about the main ingredient, so fish is the primary component.                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I should verify this using a reliable source. Maybe a web search to confirm the standard ingredients. Let me use the web_search tool with the query "main ingredient in sashimi".
