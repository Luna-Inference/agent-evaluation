Okay, the user is asking who discovered the law of conservation of momentum in particle physics. Let me think about how to approach this.             
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I need to recall if there's a specific person associated with this law. The law of conservation of momentum is a fundamental principle in      
physics, but I remember that it's often attributed to Isaac Newton. However, the question specifies particle physics, so maybe it's a different       
context.                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, in particle physics, the conservation of momentum is part of the principles in relativity and quantum mechanics. But the original law was       
formulated by Newton. However, maybe there's a specific individual in particle physics who contributed to this concept. Alternatively, maybe it's a   
general question and the answer is Newton.                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                      
But I need to verify this. The user might be expecting a specific answer, so I should check if there's a notable figure in particle physics who       
discovered this law. However, considering the law's origin, it's Newton. But perhaps the question is a trick question, and the answer is Newton.      
                                                                                                                                                      
Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to a different context. For example, in the context of quantum mechanics, the conservation of momentum 
is still a fundamental principle, but the exact discoverer might be different. But I think the main contribution is Newton.                           
                                                                                                                                                      
So, I should search for the answer. Let me use the web search tool to find who discovered the law of conservation of momentum in particle physics. The
answer might be Newton, but I need to confirm.                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the user mentioned particle physics, so maybe the answer is Newton, as he formulated the law. But I need to make sure. Let me perform a web     
search to confirm.

Thought: I need to find the discoverer of the law of conservation of momentum in particle physics. The law is a fundamental principle in physics, but 
its origin is often attributed to Newton. However, to confirm, I will perform a web search.

[Laws of conservation of momentum - ScienceQuery](https://sciencequery.com/laws-of-conservation-of-momentum/)
Sir Isaac Newton discovered the law of conservation of momentum while formulating the laws of motion. The law of conservation of momentum is a direct 
consequence of Newton's third law of motion. ... If the external force acting on a particle is zero, its momentum will remain unchanged. ... According
to the law of physics, the momentum never ...

[Who discovered conservation of momentum? - Physics Network](https://physics-network.org/who-discovered-conservation-of-momentum/)
Which of Newton's laws is conservation of momentum? Newton's second law, in its most general form, says that the rate of a change of a particle's 
momentum p is given by the force acting on the particle; i.e., F = d p/dt. If there is no force acting on the particle, then, since d p/dt = 0, p must
be constant, or conserved.

The conservation of momentum allows them to predict the paths of particles after the collision, which is crucial for discovering new particles and 
understanding fundamental forces. Astrophysics: The momentum conservation law helps astrophysicists understand the behavior of celestial bodies. For 
example, when a star explodes as a supernova, the ...

[Descartes' Physics - Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-physics/)
Thus, by failing to foresee the importance of conjoining direction and speed, Descartes' law falls just short of the modern law for the conservation 
of momentum. In this context, the complex notion of "determination" should be discussed, since it approximately corresponds to the composite direction
of a body's quantity of motion.

[Conservation of momentum | Definition, Examples, & Facts | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/science/conservation-of-momentum)
conservation of momentum, general law of physics according to which the quantity called momentum that characterizes motion never changes in an 
isolated collection of objects; that is, the total momentum of a system remains constant. Momentum is equal to the mass of an object multiplied by its
velocity and is equivalent to the force required to bring the object to a stop in a unit length of time.

momentum?](https://hsm.stackexchange.com/questions/2472/who-came-up-with-the-laws-of-conservation-of-momentum)
Motion being "le transport d'une partie de la matière, ou d'un corps" this is probably the first enonciation of the conservation law for linear 
momentum. The book was published in 1664, some 30 years after it was written, and meanwhile the Principles of philosophy published in 1644 stated:

[Conservation of Momentum - The Physics Hypertextbook](https://physics.info/momentum-conservation/)
The total momentum before an interaction is the same as the total momentum after the interaction. Momentum is conserved. The total momentum of a 
closed system is constant. 1668: John Wallis suggests the law of conservation of momentum. recoil. Action is equal and opposite reaction. collisions.

[Conservation of Momentum ‹ OpenCurriculum](https://opencurriculum.org/5450/conservation-of-momentum/)
As with all the conservation laws, the law of conservation of momentum has evolved over time. In the 1800's it was found that a beam of light striking
an object would give it some momentum, even though light has no mass, and would therefore have no momentum according to the above definition.

n_of_Momentum)
Subatomic Collisions and Momentum. The conservation of momentum principle not only applies to the macroscopic objects, it is also essential to our 
explorations of atomic and subatomic particles. Giant machines hurl subatomic particles at one another, and researchers evaluate the results by 
assuming conservation of momentum (among other things).

[Conservation of Momentum -- from Eric Weisstein's World of Physics](https://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/ConservationofMomentum.html)
Conservation of momentum is a fundamental law of physics which states that the momentum of a system is constant if there are no external forces acting
on the system. It is embodied in Newton's first law (the law of inertia). Suppose we have two interacting particles 1 and 2, possibly of different 
masses. The forces between them are equal and opposite.

Okay, so the user asked who discovered the law of conservation of momentum in particle physics. From the web search results, it seems that the law is 
generally attributed to Isaac Newton. However, the search results also mention that John Wallis suggested the law in 1668, and there's a mention of   
Descartes' work. But in the context of particle physics, the law is a fundamental principle, and Newton is often cited as the original discoverer. The
answer should clarify that Newton is the primary figure, even though there were later contributions. The final answer should state that Isaac Newton  
discovered the law, as it's the foundational concept in physics.
