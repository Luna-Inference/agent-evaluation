<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking who wrote "Don Quixote". I need to figure out how to find this information. Let's think about the tools available. The user mentioned using the web     
search tool, so I should use that.                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I'll use the web_search function with the query "Who wrote Don Quixote?". That should retrieve the top results. Then, I can check the first result to find the author. If 
the search returns the answer directly, I can just return it. If not, maybe I need to parse the result. But since the tools are notional, I'll assume the search will give the   
correct information.                                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So the code will be a web search with the query, then print the result. If the result is straightforward, the answer is there. If not, maybe another step, but for now, let's    
proceed with the search.                                                                                                                                                         
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the author of "Don Quixote".
