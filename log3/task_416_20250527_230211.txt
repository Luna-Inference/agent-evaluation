Okay, the user is asking who discovered the law of conservation of momentum in electromagnetism. Let me think about how to approach this.             
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I need to recall if there's a specific historical figure associated with this law. The law of conservation of momentum is a fundamental        
principle in physics, but I remember that it's often linked to Newton's laws. However, the question specifically mentions electromagnetism, so I      
should consider if there's a contribution from electromagnetism.                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                      
I know that James Clerk Maxwell was a key figure in electromagnetism, but I'm not sure about his role in the conservation of momentum. There's also   
the work of others like Oliver Heaviside, who dealt with vector calculus and electromagnetic theory. Wait, the law of conservation of momentum in     
electromagnetism might be related to the theory of electromagnetism and how momentum is conserved in interactions between electric and magnetic       
fields.                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                      
Another thought: in classical mechanics, Newton's third law states that for every action there's an equal and opposite reaction. However, the         
conservation of momentum in electromagnetism might be part of the broader framework. But the question is about who discovered it.                     
                                                                                                                                                      
I need to check if there's a specific person known for this. Maybe it's a combination of Newton and others. But the user might be looking for a       
specific name. Let me think again.                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the law of conservation of momentum in electromagnetism is part of the theory of electromagnetism, and it's derived from the principles of      
relativity. However, the actual discovery might be attributed to Newton. But the question is about electromagnetism, so perhaps it's a specific       
contribution.                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                      
Alternatively, maybe it's the work of James Clerk Maxwell. But I'm not sure. Let me try to recall. In the context of electromagnetism, the            
conservation of momentum is part of the equations of motion, but the actual discovery might be attributed to Newton. However, the question is about   
electromagnetism, so perhaps the answer is Newton. But I need to verify.                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Alternatively, maybe it's the work of someone else. For example, in the context of electromagnetism, the conservation of momentum is part of the      
theory, but the specific law might be linked to Maxwell's equations. However, I'm not certain.                                                        
                                                                                                                                                      
Since the user is asking for the person, and given that the law of conservation of momentum in electromagnetism is part of the broader framework, but 
the specific discovery might be attributed to Newton. However, I need to be precise.                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, in the context of electromagnetism, the conservation of momentum is part of the equations, but the actual law might be derived from Newton's    
laws. However, the question is about who discovered it. If the answer is Newton, then that's the answer. But I need to confirm.                       
                                                                                                                                                      
Alternatively, maybe it's a combination of Newton and others. But I think the answer is Newton. However, I should check if there's a specific         
reference.                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                      
Since I can't perform actual searches here, I'll have to rely on my knowledge. The law of conservation of momentum in electromagnetism is part of the 
principles of classical mechanics, and it's often attributed to Newton. Therefore, the answer is Newton. But I should make sure.                      
                                                                                                                                                      
Alternatively, maybe it's the work of someone else. For example, in the context of electromagnetism, the conservation of momentum is part of the      
theory, but the specific law might be linked to Maxwell's equations. However, I'm not sure.                                                           
                                                                                                                                                      
Given that the user is asking for the person, and considering that the law is part of classical mechanics, I think the answer is Newton. So the final 
answer would be Newton.

Thought: I need to determine who discovered the law of conservation of momentum in electromagnetism. This is a historical question, so I'll use the   
`wiki` tool to find the relevant information.

Okay, the user is asking who discovered the law of conservation of momentum in electromagnetism. Earlier attempts tried using a wiki function, but the
system denied it because the tool wasn't allowed. So I need to find another way to answer this without using the wiki tool.                           
                                                                                                                                                      
Since the previous approach failed, I should rely on my existing knowledge. The law of conservation of momentum is a fundamental principle in physics,
and it's commonly associated with Newton's laws. However, the question specifies electromagnetism, so I need to check if there's a specific           
contribution from electromagnetism.                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                      
In classical mechanics, Newton's third law states that for every action there's an equal and opposite reaction. This leads to the conservation of     
momentum. However, the conservation of momentum in electromagnetism is part of the broader framework, and the actual discovery might be attributed to 
Newton. But I need to confirm if there's a specific person associated with this law in the context of electromagnetism.                               
                                                                                                                                                      
Alternatively, maybe it's linked to the work of James Clerk Maxwell. However, Maxwell's equations deal with electromagnetism, and the conservation of 
momentum in that context is derived from the principles of relativity. But the question is about who discovered it, not the derivation.               
                                                                                                                                                      
Given that the system can't use external tools like wiki, I'll proceed with my knowledge. The law of conservation of momentum in electromagnetism is  
part of classical mechanics, and the key figure is Newton. Therefore, the answer is Newton.                                                           
                                                                                                                                                      
Final answer: Newton.
