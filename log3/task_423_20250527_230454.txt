<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Liechtenstein. I need to figure out how to find that information. Let me think about the tools available. 
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I remember that the user has access to a search function, which can be used to look up information. The tools mentioned include web search and 
visiting webpages. So maybe I can use the web_search function to find the capital.                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                      
The capital of Liechtenstein is probably a well-known fact, but to be sure, I should perform a search. The country's name is Liechtenstein, so the    
query would be something like "capital of Liechtenstein".                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                      
I should check if there's a specific tool for this. The user's previous examples used web_search with a query string. So I'll use that.               
                                                                                                                                                      
I don't need to do any complex calculations here. Just a simple search. Let me write the code to perform the web search and then retrieve the result.
