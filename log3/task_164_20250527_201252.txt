Okay, the user is asking who discovered the vaccine for polio. I need to figure out how to find this information. Let me think about the tools available.                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I remember that there's a tool called `wiki` which can search for information. Maybe I can use that to look up the history of polio vaccines. The question is about the   
discoverer, so the wiki search should give the name.                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll start by using the `wiki` tool with the query "vaccine for polio". That should return some information about the vaccine's discoverer. Once I get the result, I can extract 
the name from the response.                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the user might want the exact name, so I need to make sure the answer is precise. If the wiki search returns something like "Jonas Salk developed the polio vaccine in     
1955", then the answer is Jonas Salk. But if there's more than one person, I need to check if there are multiple discoverers. However, I recall that Salk was the primary one,   
and the other was Sabin. But the question is general, so maybe just stating Salk is sufficient.                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll proceed with the code to perform the wiki search and then extract the name from the result. If the result is in the format like "Jonas Salk developed...", then the answer  
is straightforward. If not, I might need to parse the text. But since the tools are notional, I'll assume the wiki returns the correct information.

Okay, the user is asking who discovered the polio vaccine. Earlier, I tried using the `wiki` tool but got an error because the tool wasn't allowed. Now I need to figure out     
another way to get the answer without using the `wiki` function.                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Since the previous attempt failed, maybe I should use a different approach. Let me think about common knowledge here. I remember that Jonas Salk developed the first polio       
vaccine in 1955. Another name that comes to mind is Sabin, who developed a different vaccine. But the question is general, so maybe the answer is Salk.                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Alternatively, maybe I can use web search to find the answer. The user's tools include `web_search`, so I can use that. Let me try searching for "who discovered the polio       
vaccine" using the `web_search` function.                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll write code to perform a web search and then extract the answer. Since the previous attempt with `wiki` failed, using `web_search` is the next step. I'll make sure to handle
the result properly.
