<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Vatican City. I need to find out that information. I remember that Vatican City is a small city-state in Italy, and its capital is   
Vatican City itself. But maybe I should verify this with a reliable source.                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Since the tools available include web search and wiki, I can use those. Let me first perform a web search to get the latest information. The query should be "capital of Vatican 
City". Using the web_search tool, I can get the top results. Then, I can check the first result to confirm the answer.                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Alternatively, maybe the wiki tool can provide a direct answer. But since the user might want the most current information, web search is better. Let me execute the web search  
first.                                                                                                                                                                           
</think>

Okay, so the user asked for the capital of Vatican City. From the web search results, I need to figure out the answer. The search results mention that Vatican City is an        
independent city-state surrounded by Rome, and its capital is Vatican City itself. The results also note that it's the smallest sovereign nation and the seat of the Roman       
Catholic Church. Even though the search results are a bit scattered, the key point is that the capital is Vatican City. The answer should be straightforward. I don't need to do 
any further calculations or additional searches because the information is clear from the initial results. The final answer is Vatican City.
