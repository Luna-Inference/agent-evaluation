<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking who wrote "The Odyssey". I need to figure out how to find this information. Let me think about the tools available.                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I remember that the user has access to a search function. The previous examples used web_search and visit_webpage, so maybe I can use those here. The question is about a 
well-known classic, so a web search should work.                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I should use the web_search tool with the query "Who wrote The Odyssey". The tools mentioned include web_search, which returns the top results. Then, I can parse the results to 
find the author.                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the user's tools don't have a specific database for literature, but the web_search function can handle it. So I'll perform the search, get the results, and then extract   
the answer from there.                                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I need to make sure the code is correct. The code should call web_search with the right query. Then, the answer will be in the results. Since the user wants the answer, I'll use
the final_answer function once I have the result.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Let me write the code step by step. First, perform the web search, then process the results to find the author. The final answer will be the author's name.                      
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the author of "The Odyssey" and then extract the answer.
