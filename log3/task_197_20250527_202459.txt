<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking who wrote "Brave New World." I need to figure out how to find this information. Let me think about the tools available.                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I remember that the user has access to a search function. The previous examples used web searches, so maybe I can use that here. The question is straightforward, so a    
simple web search should work. The tool mentions a function called web_search, which takes a query string.                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I should construct the query as "Brave New World author" to target the book's title and the author. Then, the search function will return the results. Once I get the results, I 
can extract the author's name from the first result.                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the user's tools include a web search function that returns the top results. So I can call that function with the query. Then, I'll check the first result to find the     
author. If the search returns the correct information, I can provide the answer.                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I need to make sure that the code is correct. The code should use the web_search function with the right parameters. Let me write the code: call web_search with "Brave New World
author" and then parse the first result to get the author's name. Finally, use the final_answer to present the result.                                                           
</think>
