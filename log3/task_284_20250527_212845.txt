Okay, the user is asking who discovered the law of inheritance. I need to figure out the answer. Let me think.                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, the law of inheritance is related to genetics. I remember that Mendel was a key figure in this area. He did experiments with pea plants and proposed the laws of          
segregation and independent assortment. But wait, the question is about the law of inheritance, which might refer to Mendel's laws. However, sometimes people confuse Mendel with
others like Darwin or Watson and Crick. But the correct answer is Mendel.                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
But I should verify this. Maybe there's a different perspective. For example, in some contexts, the law of inheritance might refer to the genetic principles established by      
Mendel. So the answer should be Johann Gregor Mendel. But I need to make sure there's no other figure involved here.                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I should use the web search tool to confirm. Let me check the search results. The web search would return information about Mendel's contributions. If the search shows that he  
discovered the law of inheritance, then that's the answer. If there's any other name mentioned, I need to adjust.                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the user might be referring to the law of inheritance as a general principle, which is part of Mendelian genetics. So the answer is Mendel. But I should make sure the     
search confirms this. Let me proceed with the search.                                                                                                                            
</think>

Introduction Mendelian inheritance (or Mendelian genetics or Mendelism) is a set of primary tenets relating to the transmission of hereditary characteristics from parent 
organisms to their children; it underlies much of genetics. The tenets were initially derived from the work of Gregor Mendel published in 1865 and 1866, which was 
"re-discovered" in 1900; they were initially very ...

[Mendel's Laws of Inheritance - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mendel-laws-of-inheritance/)
Mendel's experiments focused on the inheritance of certain traits, such as seed color, pod shape, and flower color, and he discovered that these traits are passed down 
predictably. In this article, we will learn about Mendel's Laws of Inheritance, the Characteristics of Mendel experiments, and the Conclusion of the experiments.

Mendelian inheritance, principles of heredity formulated by Austrian-born botanist, teacher, and Augustinian prelate Gregor Mendel in 1865. These principles form what is known 
as the system of particulate inheritance by units, or genes. Mendel's laws include the law of segregation and the law of independent assortment.

[Gregor Mendel: The Father of Genetics and his Contributions](https://scienceofbiogenetics.com/articles/who-is-the-father-of-genetics-and-why)
Through careful experimentation, Mendel discovered two fundamental laws that govern inheritance, known as Mendel's Laws: the law of segregation and the law of independent 
assortment. The law of segregation states that an individual inherits two copies of each gene, one from each parent, and these genes segregate (separate) during the ...

[Gregor Mendel (1822-1884) :: CSHL DNA Learning Center](https://dnalc.cshl.edu/view/16151-Biography-1-Gregor-Mendel-1822-1884-.html)
Gregor Mendel, through his work on pea plants, discovered the fundamental laws of inheritance. He deduced that genes come in pairs and are inherited as distinct units, one from 
each parent. Mendel tracked the segregation of parental genes and their appearance in the offspring as dominant or recessive traits.

[Mendelian inheritance | Gregor Mendel, Genes, & Genetics | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/science/Mendelian-inheritance)
Mendelian inheritance, principles of heredity formulated by Austrian-born botanist, teacher, and Augustinian prelate Gregor Mendel in 1865. These principles form what is known 
as the system of particulate inheritance by units, or genes. Mendel's laws include the law of segregation and the law of independent assortment.

Through careful experimentation, Mendel discovered two fundamental laws that govern inheritance, known as Mendel's Laws: the law of segregation and the law of independent 
assortment. The law of segregation states that an individual inherits two copies of each gene, one from each parent, and these genes segregate (separate) during the ...

Gregor Mendel, through his work on pea plants, discovered the fundamental laws of inheritance. He deduced that genes come in pairs and are inherited as distinct units, one from 
each parent. Mendel tracked the segregation of parental genes and their appearance in the offspring as dominant or recessive traits.

[Mendelian inheritance | Gregor Mendel, Genes, & Genetics | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/science/Mendelian-inheritance)
Mendelian inheritance, principles of heredity formulated by Austrian-born botanist, teacher, and Augustinian prelate Gregor Mendel in 1865. These principles form what is known 
as the system of particulate inheritance by units, or genes. Mendel's laws include the law of segregation and the law of independent assortment.

Through careful experimentation, Mendel discovered two fundamental laws that govern inheritance, known as Mendel's Laws: the law of segregation and the law of independent 
assortment. The law of segregation states that an individual inherits two copies of each gene, one from each parent, and these genes segregate (separate) during the ...

Gregor Mendel, through his work on pea plants, discovered the fundamental laws of inheritance. He deduced that genes come in pairs and are inherited as distinct units, one from 
each parent. Mendel tracked the segregation of parental genes and their appearance in the offspring as dominant or recessive traits.

The law of inheritance was proposed by Gregor Mendel after conducting experiments on pea plants for seven years. Mendel's laws of inheritance include law of dominance, law of 
segregation and law of independent assortment. The law of segregation states that every individual possesses two alleles and only one allele is passed on to the offspring.

Through careful experimentation, Mendel discovered two fundamental laws that govern inheritance, known as Mendel's Laws: the law of segregation and the law of independent 
assortment. The law of segregation states that an individual inherits two copies of each gene, one from each parent, and these genes segregate (separate) during the ...
