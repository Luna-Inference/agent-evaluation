<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Australia. I need to find that out. Let me think about the tools I have.                                  
                                                                                                                                                      
Hmm, the available tools are web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer. So maybe I should use web_search with the query "capital of Australia". Let 
me check if that's straightforward.                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the user wants the capital, which is Canberra. But I need to confirm via the tools. Let me try the web_search first. If the search returns the  
correct information, I can then use final_answer to present the answer. If not, maybe I need to visit a specific webpage. But since the capital is a  
known fact, maybe the web_search will directly give the answer. Let me proceed with the code.                                                         
</think>
