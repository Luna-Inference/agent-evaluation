<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Lebanon. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have.                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The available tools are web_search and visit_webpage. Maybe a web search would be the best approach here. I can use the web_search function with the query "capital of Lebanon"  
to get the top results. Then, I can extract the capital from the search results.                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the user might want the most recent information. So I should make sure the search is up to date. The web_search tool returns the top results, so I'll check those. If the  
first result is the capital, I can take that. If not, maybe the second result. But since the user is asking for the capital, it's likely a straightforward answer.               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll perform the web search, then parse the results to find the capital. Once I have the answer, I can use the final_answer function to present it.                              
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the capital of Lebanon and then extract the answer from the results.
