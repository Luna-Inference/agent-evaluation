Okay, the user is asking for the main ingredient in hummus. I need to figure out what the answer is. Let me think about this.                         
                                                                                                                                                      
Hummus is a traditional Middle Eastern dish made from chickpeas. They're usually cooked, mashed, and seasoned. But I should confirm this. Maybe I can 
use a web search to check the most common ingredients. The tools available include web_search and visit_webpage. Let me use web_search with the query 
"main ingredient in hummus".                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the user might expect the answer to be chickpeas, but I should make sure. If the search returns that, then I can proceed. Otherwise, maybe      
there's more to it. But based on my knowledge, chickpeas are the main ingredient. However, sometimes hummus can have other ingredients like olive oil,
garlic, or spices. But the primary one is chickpeas. So the answer should be chickpeas. Let me check the web search result to confirm.

Thought: I will use the web search tool to find the main ingredient in hummus.

Okay, so the user asked, "What is the main ingredient in hummus?" Based on the web search results, the answer seems to be chickpeas. The search       
results mention that chickpeas are the main ingredient in hummus, along with other ingredients like tahini, olive oil, garlic, and lemon juice.       
However, the user might want to confirm if chickpeas are indeed the primary ingredient or if there are other common components.                       
                                                                                                                                                      
Looking at the observation from the code execution, the web search returned multiple sources stating that chickpeas are the main ingredient. For      
example, WebMD and Recipes.net both mention chickpeas as the primary component. The other ingredients are added for flavor and texture. So, the main  
ingredient is chickpeas.                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
I should make sure there's no confusion with other ingredients. Sometimes people might think of hummus as having other main components, but the       
primary one is definitely chickpeas. The answer should clearly state that chickpeas are the main ingredient, even though other ingredients are added.
