<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Belgium. Let me think about how to approach this.                                                         
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I know that the capital of Belgium is Brussels. But maybe I should verify this using a reliable source. Since the tools available include web  
search and wiki, I can use those to confirm.                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                      
I'll start by using the web_search tool with the query "capital of Belgium" to get the top results. Then, I can check the first result to confirm the 
answer. If the search returns the correct information, I can extract the capital from there.                                                          
                                                                                                                                                      
Alternatively, using the wiki tool with the query "capital of Belgium" might directly provide the answer. But since the user might expect a direct    
answer, I'll proceed with the web search first to ensure accuracy.                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                      
Once I have the result, I'll parse it to find the capital city. If the search returns a list of cities, I'll pick the first one as the capital. Then, 
I'll use the final_answer tool to present the result.                                                                                                 
</think>

Okay, so the user asked for the capital of Belgium. From the web search results, I need to find the answer. The search results mention that Brussels  
is the capital and the largest urban agglomeration of Belgium. The Wikipedia page also states that Brussels is the capital and the de facto capital of
the European Union. The other results talk about Brussels being a bilingual city and a financial hub, but the main point is that it's the capital.    
                                                                                                                                                      
The code snippet tried using web_search with the query "capital of Belgium" and printed the results. The observation shows that the search results    
list Brussels as the capital, but the exact wording is a bit vague. The user's question is straightforward, so the answer should be Brussels. Even    
though the search results don't explicitly state it, the context from the Wikipedia page confirms it. Therefore, the final answer is Brussels.
