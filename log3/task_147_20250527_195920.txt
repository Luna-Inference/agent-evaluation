<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of the Czech Republic. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have.                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I can use the web search tool to look up the capital. The previous examples show that using web_search with a query like "current pope age" works. So here, the query     
should be "capital of Czech Republic".                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I should call the web_search function with that query. Then, the result will give the capital. Once I have the answer, I can use the final_answer tool to present it.            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the tools are web_search and final_answer. So the steps are: perform a web search for the capital of the Czech Republic, get the result, and then output it. Let me write  
the code accordingly.                                                                                                                                                            
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the capital of the Czech Republic.
