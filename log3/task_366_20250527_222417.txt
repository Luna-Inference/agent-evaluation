Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Armenia. Let me think about how to approach this.                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I know that Armenia's capital is Yerevan. But maybe I should verify this using a reliable source. Since the user might want the most accurate answer, I should check a    
trustworthy database or a web search.                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Looking at the tools available, there's the 'wiki' function which can retrieve information. Let me use that. The query would be "capital of Armenia". The wiki tool should return
the correct information.                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Once I get the result from the wiki, I can directly answer the user. If the wiki returns Yerevan, then that's the answer. If there's any uncertainty, maybe I should perform a   
web search to confirm. But given that Yerevan is a well-known capital, the wiki should have the correct answer.                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So the steps are: call the wiki function with the query, retrieve the capital, and then present it as the final answer.                                                          
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the `wiki` tool to find the capital of Armenia.

Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Armenia. Previously, I tried using the `wiki` tool but got an error because the tool wasn't allowed. Now I need to find another way  
to get the correct answer without using the forbidden tool.                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Since the capital of Armenia is a known fact, Yerevan, I can directly answer based on my knowledge. But to follow the rules strictly, I need to ensure I don't use any external  
tools. However, the user's question is straightforward, and Yerevan is a well-established fact. So I can provide the answer directly without any code execution.
