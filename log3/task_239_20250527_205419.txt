<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking who wrote "The Little Prince." Let me think about how to approach this.                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I need to find the author of the book. The book is a well-known literary work, but I should verify the author to be sure. Since the user is asking for the author, I can  
use a search tool to look up the book's information.                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll use the web_search function with the query "The Little Prince author." That should return the top results. Then, I can check the first result to find the author's name. If 
the search returns the author's name, I can directly answer the question. If not, maybe I need to refine the search terms.                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the user might expect the answer to be Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, but I should confirm through the search. Let me execute the code to perform the search and then extract   
the author's name from the result.                                                                                                                                               
</think>
