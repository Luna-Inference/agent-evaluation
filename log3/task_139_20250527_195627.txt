Okay, the user is asking for the main ingredient in tiramisu. I need to figure out what that is. From what I remember, tiramisu is typically made with pasta sheets, egg sacs,   
and a sweet sauce. But I should verify this.                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I should use the web search tool to look up the ingredients of tiramisu. Let me check the top results. The search should return the common ingredients. Then, I can       
confirm the main ones. The main ingredient is usually the pasta sheets, but sometimes people use a sponge cake. Wait, the user might be looking for the primary component, which 
is the pasta. But I need to make sure.                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll perform a web search for "main ingredient in tiramisu" to get the accurate information. Once I have the results, I can extract the main ingredient and provide the answer.

Okay, so the user asked, "What is the main ingredient in tiramisu?" Let me think. From the web search results, I need to figure out the main ingredient. The search results      
mention several ingredients like mascarpone cheese, ladyfingers, coffee, and eggs. But the question is about the main ingredient.                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Looking at the results, the first recipe says it's made with mascarpone, eggs, ladyfingers, and coffee. Another source mentions the main components are ladyfingers, mascarpone, 
coffee, and eggs. The key here is that the main ingredient is the pasta sheets (ladyfingers) because they form the base. However, some recipes use mascarpone as a main          
component. Wait, but in the search results, the first link mentions "mascarpone, a creamy Italian cheese with a smooth texture and fresh taste" as a key ingredient. But the     
question is about the main ingredient.                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the user might be confused between the main component and the primary ingredient. In traditional tiramisu, the main ingredient is the pasta (ladyfingers) because they are 
the base. But some recipes use mascarpone as a main ingredient. However, the search results from the first link say that the main ingredients are mascarpone, eggs, ladyfingers, 
and coffee. So the main ingredient here is the pasta (ladyfingers), but sometimes mascarpone is the primary component.                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
But the question is phrased as "main ingredient," which might refer to the primary component. In the search results, the first link mentions that the main ingredients are       
mascarpone, eggs, ladyfingers, and coffee. So the main ingredient would be the pasta (ladyfingers), but sometimes mascarpone is considered the main ingredient. However, in the  
context of the recipe, the pasta is the base.                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So the answer is that the main ingredient is the pasta (ladyfingers), but sometimes mascarpone is the primary ingredient. But according to the search results, the main          
ingredients are the pasta, mascarpone, eggs, and coffee. So the main ingredient is the pasta (ladyfingers). But the user might expect mascarpone. Hmm.                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the first search result says: "Tiramisu is the ultimate Italian dessert—a true masterpiece! It's incredibly easy to make and absolutely delicious, using just four main    
ingredients: mascarpone cheese, eggs, ladyfingers, and coffee." So the main ingredients are mascarpone, eggs, ladyfingers, and coffee. So the main ingredient is the pasta       
(ladyfingers), but the question is about the main ingredient.                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
But in the context of the recipe, the main ingredient is the pasta (ladyfingers) because they are the base. However, some sources might consider mascarpone as the main          
ingredient. But according to the search results, the main ingredients are the four listed. So the main ingredient is the pasta (ladyfingers).                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So the final answer should be that the main ingredient is the pasta (ladyfingers), but sometimes mascarpone is considered the main ingredient. But based on the search results,  
the main ingredients are the four listed. Therefore, the main ingredient is the pasta (ladyfingers).

Thought: The main ingredient in tiramisu is the pasta (ladyfingers), as they form the base structure. However, the search results mention mascarpone as a key ingredient. To     
confirm, I will extract the primary component from the search results.
