<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, I need to find out who wrote the book "For Whom the Bell Tolls." Let's start by thinking about the tools I have. The available tools are web_search, visit_webpage, and    
final_answer. Since I need to find the author, a web search would be the best approach.                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I should perform a web search for the book's title. The query should be something like "For Whom the Bell Tolls author." Then, I can use the web_search tool to get the   
results. Once I have the search results, I can extract the author's name from the top result.                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the user mentioned using the web_search function, so I'll structure the code to call web_search with the query. Then, I'll process the returned results to find the author.
If the search returns the author's name directly, I can use that. If not, maybe I need to visit the webpage and read the content. But since the web_search tool returns the top  
results, I'll check those first.                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Let me write the code: call web_search with the query, then print the first result to see if it contains the author's name. If the result is a link, I can extract the author    
from there. Alternatively, if the search result is a paragraph, I can parse it. But since the tools are notional, I'll assume that the web_search returns the necessary          
information.                                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Once I have the author's name, I can use the final_answer tool to present it.

Okay, the previous attempt didn't find any results. Let me try a different approach. Maybe the book's title needs to be more specific or include the author's name.              
Alternatively, I can use a broader search term. Let me try searching for "For Whom the Bell Tolls author" again but with slight variations. If that doesn't work, perhaps I can  
search for the book's publication details first. Wait, the book is a classic, so maybe checking a reputable source like a library database would help. But since I can only use  
the available tools, I'll adjust the query to include "classic" or "novel" to narrow it down. Let's try that.
