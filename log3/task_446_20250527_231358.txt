Okay, let's tackle this question: "Who discovered the law of conservation of energy in quantum field theory?"                                         
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I need to recall what the law of conservation of energy is. From my basic physics knowledge, energy is conserved in isolated systems, meaning  
it can't be created or destroyed, only transformed. But the question specifically mentions quantum field theory, so I should focus on that context.   
                                                                                                                                                      
I remember that in quantum field theory, the concept of energy conservation is a fundamental principle. However, the exact discoverer might be someone
from the early 20th century. The famous figure associated with this is Einstein, but I'm not sure if he was the first to formulate it. Wait,          
Einstein's theory of relativity deals with energy and mass, but the conservation of energy in quantum contexts might be more related to quantum       
mechanics.                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                      
Another key figure is Planck, who introduced the idea of quantized energy. But that's in the context of blackbody radiation. Then there's Max Planck, 
who also contributed to quantum theory. However, the law of conservation of energy in quantum field theory might be part of the broader framework     
developed by Einstein and others.                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the law of conservation of energy in quantum field theory is a fundamental principle, but the specific person who first discovered it might be a
bit ambiguous. However, considering the context of quantum field theory, which emerged from the work of Einstein, Heisenberg, Schrödinger, and others,
the answer might be someone like Einstein or Planck.                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                      
But I need to verify this. Since I can't perform actual research here, I should use the tools provided. The available tools are web_search and        
visit_webpage. So I should use web_search to find the answer.                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                      
The query would be something like "who discovered the law of conservation of energy in quantum field theory". Let me structure the code to perform a  
web search for that specific question.                                                                                                                
</think>

[Who Discovered the Law of Conservation of Energy? (Description)](https://thepowerfacts.com/who-discovered-the-law-of-conservation-of-energy/)
In 1845, German physician Julius Robert Mayer discovered the law of conservation of energy. This law states that energy cannot be created or 
destroyed, but only transformed from one form to another. For example, when a ball is dropped, the potential energy it has due to its height is 
converted into kinetic energy as it falls.

The first impact in this field was made by A. Einstein who, on the one hand, pointed out that the introduction of the energy quanta, determined by the
quantum of action, appeared suitable for obtaining a simple explanation for a series of noteworthy observations during the action of light, such as 
Stokes' Law, electron emission, and gas ...

[How Max Planck Discovered Quantum Theory](https://www.wondersofphysics.com/2023/04/how-max-planck-discovered-quantum-theory.html)
It was from Müller that Planck first learned the principle of conservation of energy as a 10 year old - that energy can neither be created nor 
destroyed. This is how Planck first came in contact with the field of physics.

[Conservation of energy - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_energy)
The law of conservation of energy states that the total energy of an isolated system remains constant; it is said to be conserved over time. [1] In 
the case of a closed system, the principle says that the total amount of energy within the system can only be changed through energy entering or 
leaving the system.

Therefore the theory of the conservation of energy is incomplete without a consideration of the energy which is associated with the light or, in 
general, with the electromagnetic field. We take up now the law of conservation of energy and, also, of momentum for the fields.

At almost the same time the discovery of a fixed numerical relation between heat and work was made by two very different men, Julius Robert Mayer 
(1814-1878) and James Prescott Joule (I818-I889). Mayer, a German physician on a Dutch.ship, dis- covered the law of conservation of energy by a 
sudden intuition.

[Conservation of energy - New World Encyclopedia](https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Conservation_of_energy)
However, with Albert Einstein 's formulation of the theory of special relativity, scientists now view the conservation of energy as part of a larger 
law, namely, the conservation of "mass-energy."
