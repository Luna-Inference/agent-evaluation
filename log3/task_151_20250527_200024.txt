Okay, the user is asking for the main ingredient in goulash. I need to figure out what that is. Goulash is a traditional Romanian dish, right? So, I should probably look up the 
ingredients. But how?                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Hmm, the available tools are web search and visiting webpages. So maybe I can use the web_search function to find the ingredients. Let me think. The user wants the main         
ingredient, so I need to find the most common one.                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the tools mentioned include web_search and visit_webpage. So I can perform a web search for "goulash ingredients" to get the top results. Then, extract the main ingredient
from the search results.                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
But how to structure the code? Let me plan. First, use web_search with the query "goulash ingredients". Then, check the first result to see what it says. The main ingredient    
might be listed there. Once I have the answer, I can present it as the final answer.                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I need to make sure that the code is correct. Let me write the code: call web_search with the query, then process the result to find the main ingredient. Maybe the first result 
mentions the ingredients, and the main one is the first listed. Alternatively, maybe the search returns a list, and I need to parse it.                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
But since the tools don't have a way to parse the results, I have to assume that the web_search returns a string that includes the ingredients. So, in the code, after getting   
the search results, I can check for the main ingredient. For example, if the search result says "Goulash is made with beef, onions, tomatoes, etc.", then the main ingredient is 
beef.                                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
But how to handle this in code? Let me write the code to perform the search and then extract the main ingredient from the first result. Let's proceed.                           
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the ingredients of goulash and then extract the main ingredient from the search results.                                         
Code:
