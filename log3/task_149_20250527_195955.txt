<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking who wrote "The Brothers Karamazov." I need to figure out how to find this information. Let me think about the tools available.                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I remember that the user has access to a search function. The previous examples used web searches, so maybe I can use that here. The question is about a book, so a web   
search should work. The tool names are web_search and visit_webpage, but since the user didn't specify a particular website, I'll use the general web search function.           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I should construct a query that specifically asks who wrote the book. The query might be something like "Who wrote The Brothers Karamazov?" or similar. Using the web_search     
function with that query should return the answer.                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the user's tools include web_search, which returns the top results. So I'll call web_search with the query. Then, I can parse the result to find the author. But since the 
tools don't have a specific function to extract the author from the search results, I'll have to rely on the search output.                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Once I get the search results, I can look for mentions of the book and its author. The answer should be straightforward. Let me write the code to perform the search and then    
extract the information.                                                                                                                                                         
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the author of "The Brothers Karamazov" and then return the final answer.
