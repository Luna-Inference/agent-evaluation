Okay, the user is asking who discovered the planet Uranus. Let me think about how to approach this.                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I know that Uranus is one of the gas giants in our solar system, and it was discovered by William Herschel in the early 18th century. But I need to confirm this. Since   
the task is to find the answer, I should use the available tools to get the correct information.                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Looking at the tools provided, there's a 'wiki' function that can be used to search for information. So I'll use that to look up the discovery of Uranus. The 'wiki' function    
takes a query parameter, which in this case would be "who discovered Uranus".                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I should call the wiki function with the query "who discovered Uranus" to get the relevant information. Then, I can extract the answer from the result and present it as the     
final answer.

Okay, the user is asking who discovered Uranus. I need to find the correct answer. From my knowledge, Uranus was discovered by William Herschel in 1781. But since the previous  
attempt failed because the 'wiki' tool wasn't allowed, I need to find another way.                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Since the allowed tools are limited, maybe I can use a web search directly. The user's system might have restricted external tools, so I'll use the web_search function instead. 
I'll search for "who discovered Uranus" to get the answer. Then, I'll extract the information from the search results and present it as the final answer.                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I should make sure to use the correct function calls. The web_search function takes a query parameter, so I'll set the query to "who discovered Uranus". Then, I'll print the    
result to confirm the answer before finalizing it.
