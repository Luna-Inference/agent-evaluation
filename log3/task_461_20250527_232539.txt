<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, let's see. The user is asking who wrote the book "How Lisa Loved the King". First, I need to figure out how to find this information. Since I   
can use web search tools, I should start by performing a search for the book's title.                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
I'll use the web_search function with the query "How Lisa Loved the King author". That should retrieve the top results. Once I get the search results,
I need to check the sources mentioned. The answer will be the author's name from the first relevant result.                                           
                                                                                                                                                      
I'll write a code snippet to do this, search for the book, and then extract the author's name from the first result. If the search returns the author 
immediately, I can just final answer it. If not, maybe I need to look through the results again. But given the constraints, I'll proceed with the     
initial search.
