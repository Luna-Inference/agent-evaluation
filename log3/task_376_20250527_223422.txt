<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking for the chemical symbol of antimony. Let me think about how to approach this.                                                
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I know that chemical symbols are usually one or two letters, and they are derived from the element's name. Antimony is a chemical element, so  
its symbol should be something like Sb. But maybe I should verify this to be sure.                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                      
Since I can use the web search tool, I should check the latest information. Let me use the web_search function with the query "chemical symbol for    
antimony". That should give me the correct symbol.                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                      
Once I get the result, I can extract the symbol from the top search result. Then, I can use the final_answer tool to provide the answer.
