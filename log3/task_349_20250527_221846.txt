Okay, the user is asking about the main ingredient in beshbarmak. Let me think. Beshbarmak is a type of traditional Central Asian dish, right? I remember it's a type of         
flatbread with meat, maybe lamb or beef. But I need to confirm the main ingredients.                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I should check reliable sources. Since I can't browse the internet, maybe I can use the tools provided. The available tools are web_search and visit_webpage. So I need to
perform a web search to find the ingredients.                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The query should be something like "main ingredients of beshbarmak". Let me use the web_search tool with that query. Then, based on the results, I can extract the main          
ingredients. If the search returns information about the ingredients, I can parse it and give the answer.                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the user might expect the answer to be lamb or beef, but I need to make sure. Let me structure the code to perform the search and then process the results. If the search  
returns a list, I can take the first entry or the relevant part. Then, the final answer would be the main ingredient.                                                            
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the main ingredients of beshbarmak and then extract the answer from the results.
