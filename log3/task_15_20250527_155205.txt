Okay, the user is asking for the capital city of Japan. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have.                         
                                                                                                                                                      
Hmm, the available tools are web search, visiting webpages, and final answer. So maybe I should use the web search function to look up the capital of 
Japan. The capital of Japan is Tokyo, but I should confirm this with a search to make sure there's no confusion with other cities. Let me perform a   
web search for "capital of Japan" to get the accurate result. Then, I can use the final_answer tool to present the answer.
