Okay, the user is asking for the year World War II ended. I need to find that information. I remember that World War II started in 1939 and ended in  
1945. But maybe I should verify this using a reliable source.                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I can use the web search tool to look up the end year of World War II. Let me check the top results. If the search returns something like      
"World War II ended in 1945", then that's the answer. If not, maybe I need to look into more details. But since the user is asking for the year, the  
answer is likely 1945. However, to be sure, I should perform a web search to confirm.

Okay, so the user asked, "What year did World War II end?" Based on the web search results, I need to determine the exact year. The search results    
mention that World War II in Europe ended on May 8, 1945, and in Japan on August 14, 1945. However, the user is asking for the year, not the specific 
date. The answer is typically cited as 1945, but the exact date varies between Europe and Japan. Since the question is about the year, the answer is  
1945. The search results also note that V-E Day (Europe) was on May 8 and V-J Day (Japan) on September 2. But the global end of the war happened in   
1945. So the final answer is 1945.
