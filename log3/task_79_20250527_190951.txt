<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking who invented the light bulb. Let me think about how to approach this.                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I need to find the answer. The tools available include web search, which I can use to look up the inventor of the light bulb. The previous examples show that using       
web_search with a query like "inventor of light bulb" would retrieve the information.                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I should check the tools again. The web_search function takes a query string and returns the top results. So I'll use that. The answer will be the first result from the search. 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the user might want the exact name, like Thomas Edison, but I need to confirm. Let me perform the search. The code would be something like web_search("inventor of light   
bulb") and then extract the first result.                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Once I get the answer, I can use the final_answer tool to present it. I need to make sure the code is correct and follows the rules. No variables should be named similarly to   
the tools, and the code should be simple.                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So the steps are: call web_search with the query, get the result, and then output the answer. Let's write the code.                                                              
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the inventor of the light bulb and then return the final answer.
