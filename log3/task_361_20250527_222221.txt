<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the main ingredient in shashlik. I need to figure out how to find this information. Shashlik is a traditional dish from Central Asia, usually made  
with lamb or beef. But to be precise, I should look up the exact ingredients.                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I'll use the web search tool to find the recipe or ingredient list for shashlik. The query should be straightforward. I'll search for "shashlik ingredients" to get the   
relevant results. Then, I can check the top results to find the main ingredients mentioned.                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Once I have the search results, I need to extract the information. The main ingredient is likely the primary component listed in the recipe. If the search returns a recipe or a 
food database, I'll look for the ingredients section. If there's a list, the first item would be the main one.                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
After gathering the information, I'll compile the answer. If the search shows that lamb is the main ingredient, I'll state that. If it's beef, I'll mention that. Also, consider 
if there are any variations or additional ingredients mentioned.                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I should make sure the answer is accurate based on the search results. If the search returns multiple sources, I'll pick the most reliable one. If there's a consensus among the 
sources, that's the main ingredient. If not, I'll note that different sources might list different main ingredients.

Okay, so the user asked for the main ingredient in shashlik. Let me look at the search results. The first result mentions tender beef, peppers, onions, and skewers. Another     
recipe says beef, onions, spices, and water. A third source talks about meat skewers from Central Asia. The fourth recipe lists pork, zucchini, and cherry tomatoes. The fifth   
discusses a Russian version with meat, onions, spices, and water. The sixth is about marinating meat with ingredients like bell peppers, onions, and spices. The seventh recipe  
uses beef, tomatoes, honey, caraway seeds, and curry powder. The eighth is a test kitchen recipe with beef and marinade. The ninth is a Russian recipe with beef, onions, spices,
and water. The tenth is a Uzbek recipe with pork, zucchini, and tomatoes.                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
From all these, the main ingredient seems to be beef, but there are variations. The first recipe mentions beef, peppers, onions, and skewers. The sixth recipe says marinate beef
with bell peppers, onions, spices, and water. The seventh uses beef, tomatoes, honey, and spices. The eighth is a test kitchen recipe with beef and marinade. The ninth is a     
Russian recipe with beef, onions, spices, and water. The tenth is an Uzbek recipe with pork, zucchini, and tomatoes.                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So the main ingredient is usually beef, but sometimes other meats like pork or lamb are used. Since the question is about the main ingredient, and the search results mention    
beef in most recipes, I'll go with beef as the main ingredient. However, the user might expect a specific answer. Looking at the search results, the first recipe lists beef as  
the main ingredient. The other recipes mention other ingredients but beef is the primary component. So the answer is beef.
