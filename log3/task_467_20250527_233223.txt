Okay, let's tackle this question: "Who wrote 'O May I Join the Choir Invisible'?"                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I need to figure out where to find the answer. The user is asking about a specific poem. Since I don't have access to databases or external    
resources, I'll have to use the tools provided. The available tools are web_search and visit_webpage, which can help me look up information.          
                                                                                                                                                      
The steps I need to take are:                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                      
1. Use web_search to find the poem "O May I Join the Choir Invisible" and determine its author.                                                       
2. Check the search results to identify the author.                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                      
Since the user hasn't provided any specific tools beyond the ones mentioned, I'll proceed with the web_search function. I'll construct a query to     
search for the poem and then parse the results to find the author.                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                      
I should make sure to use the correct parameters for the web_search function. The query should be something like "O May I Join the Choir Invisible    
author" to target the specific poem.                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                      
Once I get the search results, I'll look for any mentions of the author. The answer will be in the form of the first result or the first entry in the 
search results.                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                      
I need to write code that performs the web search and then extracts the author's name from the results. If the search returns the author's name, I can
then use the final_answer tool to present the answer.                                                                                                 
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the author of the poem "O May I Join the Choir Invisible" and then extract the answer from the search 
results.
