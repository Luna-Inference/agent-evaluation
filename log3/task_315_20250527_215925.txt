<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Samoa. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have. The available tools are web_search, visit_webpage, and  
final_answer. Since the question is straightforward, I can use the web_search function with the query "capital of Samoa".                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the user might want the most recent information. Let me check if there's a need to verify via a specific source. But the tools don't have a specific database, so the      
web_search should suffice. I'll perform the search and then retrieve the result.                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Code-wise, I'll call web_search with the query. Then, once I get the result, I can use the final_answer to present the answer. Let me write the code.
