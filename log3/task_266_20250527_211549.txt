<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking who discovered the law of electrolysis. I need to figure out the answer. Let me think.                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I remember that the law of electrolysis was discovered by Alessandro Volta. But wait, I should verify this. Maybe there's some confusion with other scientists. Let me    
check.                                                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I should use the web search tool to look up the discovery of the law of electrolysis. The query would be something like "who discovered the law of electrolysis". Let me run that
search.                                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Once I get the results, I can parse the information to find the correct answer. If the search returns that Volta was the discoverer, then that's the answer. If not, maybe       
another scientist is involved. But I think Volta is the correct answer here.                                                                                                     
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web search tool to find the discoverer of the law of electrolysis.

Okay, so the user asked who discovered the law of electrolysis. From the web search results, it looks like the answer is Michael Faraday. The search results mention that Faraday
discovered the laws of electrolysis, including the first and second laws. Even though there's a mention of Alessandro Volta in some sources, those references seem to be about   
different laws (like the law of electrochemical equivalence). The key points from the observations are that the search results consistently point to Michael Faraday as the      
discoverer. Therefore, the final answer should be Michael Faraday.
