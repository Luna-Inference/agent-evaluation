Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Egypt. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have available. The tools include  
web search, visiting web pages, and final answer. Since the question is straightforward, I can use the web search tool to look up the capital of      
Egypt.                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I'll use the web_search function with the query "capital of Egypt". The result should give me the answer directly. Once I get the result, I can
extract the capital from the search results. Then, I'll use the final_answer tool to present the answer.
