Okay, the user is asking for the currency of Brazil. I need to figure out what the correct answer is. From what I remember, Brazil uses the Brazilian 
real, which is abbreviated as BRL. But I should verify this to make sure.                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                      
Looking at the tools available, the web_search function can be used here. I'll perform a web search to find the latest information on Brazil's        
currency. The query should be straightforward, like "currency of Brazil".                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                      
I'll call the web_search function with the query "currency of Brazil" to get the top results. Then, I can check the first result to confirm the       
currency. If the search returns something like "Brazilian real (BRL)", I can extract that information.                                                
                                                                                                                                                      
Once I have the result, I'll use the final_answer tool to present the answer. Since the user wants the currency, the answer should be "Brazilian real"
or "BRL".                                                                                                                                             
</think>
