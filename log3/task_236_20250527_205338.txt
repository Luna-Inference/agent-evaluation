<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking who discovered the double helix structure of DNA. I need to figure out the answer. Let me think.                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I remember that the double helix structure was discovered by James Watson and Francis Crick. But I should verify this. Maybe there's more to it. Wait, the question is    
straightforward, but I should check if there are any other contributors or if there's any recent developments. However, the standard answer is Watson and Crick. But maybe the   
user wants to know the exact names. Let me confirm.                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I can use the web search tool to look up the discovery. Let's see. The tool 'web_search' can be used with the query "who discovered the double helix structure of DNA". The      
observation will give the top results. Then, I can extract the answer from there.                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So the steps would be: perform a web search for the question, get the results, and then retrieve the answer from the search results. Then, use the final_answer tool to present  
the answer.                                                                                                                                                                      
</think>

[Francis Crick, Rosalind Franklin, James Watson, and Maurice 
Wilkins](https://www.sciencehistory.org/education/scientific-biographies/james-watson-francis-crick-maurice-wilkins-and-rosalind-franklin/)
Franklin's images allowed James Watson and Francis Crick to create their famous two-strand, or double-helix, model. In 1962 Watson (b. 1928), Crick (1916-2004), and Wilkins 
(1916-2004) jointly received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their 1953 determination of the structure of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).

[The Discovery of the Double Helix, 1951-1953 | Francis Crick - Profiles ...](https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/spotlight/sc/feature/doublehelix)
The discovery in 1953 of the double helix, the twisted-ladder structure of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), by James Watson and Francis Crick marked a milestone in the history of 
science and gave rise to modern molecular biology, which is largely concerned with understanding how genes control the chemical processes within cells.

The DNA double helix is anti-parallel, which means that the 5' end of one strand is paired with the 3' end of its complementary strand (and vice versa). As shown in Figure 4, 
nucleotides are ...

containing human genes.

[The Discovery of the DNA Double Helix - ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283603014128)
The structure of the DNA double helix, with its complementary base-pairing, is one of the greatest discoveries in biology in the 20th Century. It was also most dramatic, since, 
quite unexpectedly, the structure itself pointed to the way in which a DNA molecule might replicate itself, and hence revealed the "secret of life".

And they were able to establish that it wasn't a single helix, but it was a double helix. And you actually had these base pairs forming the rungs of the double helix, and that 
was really interesting because that showed how DNA could replicate itself, how it could contain actual information. And we go into much much more depth in two future videos.

still working on their model, Pauling published a paper suggesting a triple-helical structure for DNA. Others quickly realized that the model was chemically flawed.

sciences. This groundbreaking model depicted DNA as a ladder-like structure, composed of two intertwined helical strands with external ribose-phosphate chains and internal rungs
made of paired amino acids: adenine, thymine ...
