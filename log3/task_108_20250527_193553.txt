<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Sweden. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have. The available tools are web_search, visit_webpage, and 
final_answer. Since the question is straightforward, I can use the web_search function to look up the capital of Sweden.                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I'll call the web_search with the query "capital of Sweden". Then, I'll process the results to extract the capital city. The results from the web search should give me   
the answer directly. Once I have the information, I can use the final_answer tool to present the result.                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I should make sure that the web_search returns the correct information. If there's a possibility of multiple results, I need to check which one is the capital. But since        
Sweden's capital is clearly Stockholm, the search should return that. Let me execute the code to get the answer.
