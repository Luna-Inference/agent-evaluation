<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking for the melting point of gold. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have.                         
                                                                                                                                                      
The available tools are web_search and visit_webpage, but the user didn't mention any specific tools for this. Wait, the tools listed are web_search, 
visit_webpage, final_answer, and others like wiki. But the user's task is straightforward. Since the user is asking for a factual answer, I can use   
the web_search function to look up the melting point of gold.                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                      
So, I'll use the web_search tool with the query "melting point of gold". The result should give the temperature at which gold melts. Let me check the 
possible results. If the search returns the correct value, like 1064°C, then I can present that as the answer.                                        
                                                                                                                                                      
I need to make sure the code is correct. The code should call web_search with the right query. Then, the final answer will be the result from the     
search. Let me write the code.                                                                                                                        
</think>
