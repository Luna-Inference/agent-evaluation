<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking who wrote "The Stranger". I need to find the author of this novel. Let me think about the tools available. The previous examples used web search and    
wiki queries. Maybe I can use a web search here.                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I should perform a web search for the book title. The query might be something like "The Stranger author". Then, check the top results to find the author. Alternatively, 
maybe using the wiki tool could help, but I'm not sure if there's a specific entry for this. Since the user didn't specify a particular tool, I'll go with the web search.       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll write a code snippet to do a web search with the query "The Stranger author". Then, extract the author from the result. If the search returns the author's name, that's the 
answer. If not, maybe try a different query. But based on the previous examples, the tool is designed to return the top results. So I'll proceed.                                
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web search tool to find the author of "The Stranger" and then return the final answer.
