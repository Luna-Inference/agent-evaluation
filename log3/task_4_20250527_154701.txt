Okay, the user wants a one-sentence summary of Einstein's theory of relativity. Let me think about the key points. The theory has two parts: special  
and general relativity. Special relativity deals with objects moving at constant speeds, especially near light speed, and introduces concepts like    
time dilation and mass increase. General relativity explains gravity as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. So combining these, the 
summary should mention both theories and their main ideas.                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                      
I need to check if there's a standard way to phrase this. Maybe something like, "Einstein's theory of relativity consists of two parts: special       
relativity, which describes the behavior of objects moving at constant speeds, and general relativity, which explains gravity as the curvature of     
spacetime caused by mass and energy." That should be concise and cover both aspects. Let me make sure there are no errors in the terms. Yes, "constant
speeds" and "curvature of spacetime" are correct. Alright, that's the summary.                                                                        
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will summarize the theory of relativity in one sentence by combining key concepts from special and general relativity.
