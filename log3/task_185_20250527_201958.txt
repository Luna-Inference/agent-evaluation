<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking who wrote "The Old Man and the Sea." Let me think about how to approach this.                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I need to find the author of this classic novel. Since I can use web search tools, I should perform a search to find the author. The tools available include web_search   
and visit_webpage. Let me use the web_search function with the query "Who wrote The Old Man and the Sea?".                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I should check the results to confirm the author. Once I get the answer, I can present it as the final answer.                                                                   
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web search tool to find the author of "The Old Man and the Sea."
