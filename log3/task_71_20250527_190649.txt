<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking who discovered gravity. I need to figure out the answer. Let me think.                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I remember that Isaac Newton is often credited with discovering gravity. But wait, there's also Galileo Galilei, who studied motion and gravity. However, the key here is 
the discovery of the law of universal gravitation. Newton formulated the law in the 1680s, so he's the main figure here. But some sources might mention Galileo's work on        
gravity, like his experiments with falling objects. However, the question is about who "discovered" gravity, which is a bit ambiguous.                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I should check if there's a definitive answer. Since the user is looking for the answer, maybe the expected answer is Isaac Newton. But I need to confirm. Let me use the web    
search tool to find the most accurate information.                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So, I'll use the web_search function with the query "who discovered gravity" to get the top results. Then, analyze the results to determine the correct answer.

<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, so the user asked, "Who discovered gravity?" Based on the web search results, the answer seems to be Isaac Newton. The search results mention that Newton formulated the   
law of universal gravitation, which is widely recognized as the discovery of gravity. However, there's also mention of Galileo Galilei's work on falling objects and the concept 
of gravity. But the key point here is that Newton is credited with formalizing the law, which was a major breakthrough. The answer should highlight Newton's role, even though   
Galileo contributed to the idea before him.                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The observation from the code showed that the web search results confirm Newton as the primary discoverer. The final answer should state that Isaac Newton discovered gravity,   
especially since his laws of motion and universal gravitation are foundational in physics. Even though Galileo's experiments with falling objects laid the groundwork, Newton's  
formulation of the law in the Principia Mathematica is the definitive answer here.
