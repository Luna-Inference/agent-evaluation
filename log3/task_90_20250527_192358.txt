Okay, the user is asking who the founder of Microsoft is. I need to figure out how to find this information. Let me think about the tools I have available.                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I remember that the user provided some tools like web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer. So maybe I can use web_search to look up the founder of Microsoft. The     
question is straightforward, so I'll start by performing a web search with the query "founder of Microsoft".                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I should check the results to make sure. If the search returns the correct information, I can then extract the founder's name. If there's ambiguity, like if there are multiple  
founders, I might need to check more sources. But based on general knowledge, Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen. However, since the user might expect the answer
to be just Bill Gates, I should confirm with the search.                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So the plan is: use web_search with the query "founder of Microsoft", then check the results to get the answer. Once I have the answer, I can use the final_answer tool to       
present it.                                                                                                                                                                      
</think>

Okay, the user is asking about the founder of Microsoft. Earlier attempts tried using a wiki function which wasn't allowed. Since that failed, I need to find another way. Let me
think: the tools available are web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer. Maybe I can use web_search directly without relying on a wiki function.                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I should perform a web search for "founder of Microsoft" using the web_search tool. Then, extract the answer from the search results. Since the web_search tool returns the top  
results, I can parse those results to find the founder's name. Once I have the answer, I can use the final_answer tool to present it.                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I need to make sure the code is correct. The previous attempt used a forbidden function, so this time I'll use web_search directly. The code will search for the founder, check  
the results, and then output the answer. Let's write the code now.
