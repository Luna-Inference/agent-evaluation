<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking who wrote the book "1984". I need to figure out how to find this information. Let me think about the tools available.        
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I remember that the user has access to a search function. The previous examples used web_search and visit_webpage, so maybe I can use those.   
The question is straightforward: find the author of "1984".                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                      
I should use the web_search tool with the query "who wrote 1984". That should return the top results. Then, I can check the first result to find the  
author. Alternatively, if the search returns the author directly, I can just take that.                                                               
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the user's tools include a function called web_search which takes a query and returns the top results. So I'll call web_search with the query   
"who wrote 1984". Then, look at the first result to get the author's name.                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                      
I need to make sure that the code is correct. The code should be simple: call web_search with the right query, then extract the author from the first 
result. Let me write the code.                                                                                                                        
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the author of "1984" and then extract the information from the first result.                          
Code:

Okay, so the user asked who wrote "1984". The code used the web_search tool with the query "who wrote 1984". The observation shows that the search    
results mention George Orwell as the author. The first relevant result is from Wikipedia, which clearly states that "1984" is a novel by George       
Orwell. The other links talk about the book's themes, summary, and context, but the author is explicitly mentioned there. Since the code printed the  
result, which includes the author's name, the final answer should be George Orwell.
