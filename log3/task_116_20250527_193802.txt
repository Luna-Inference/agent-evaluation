<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking who wrote "War and Peace." I need to figure out how to find this information. Let me think about the tools available. The tools include web search,     
visiting webpages, and final answer. Since the question is straightforward, I can use the web search tool to look up the author of "War and Peace."                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I'll use the web_search function with the query "War and Peace author." The result should give me the answer. Once I get the result, I can extract the author's name and  
present it as the final answer.                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I should make sure to use the correct parameters for the web_search function. The query is simple, so just passing "War and Peace author" should work. Then, I'll check the      
search results to confirm the author. If the search returns the correct information, I can directly use that in the final answer.
