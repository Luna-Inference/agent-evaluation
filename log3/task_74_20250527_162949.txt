<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking for the largest island in the world. I need to figure out how to find that. Let me think about the tools available. The tools
mentioned are web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer. So perhaps I should use web_search to look up the largest island.                          
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I should perform a web search for "largest island in the world". The results might include information about Greenland, which is often cited as
the largest island. But I need to confirm the exact answer. Maybe the search will return sources that state Greenland is the largest, but I should    
check if there's any other island that's larger. Wait, the largest island by area is Greenland, but sometimes people confuse it with other islands    
like Borneo or Madagascar. However, according to geological data, Greenland is the largest. So the answer should be Greenland. But I need to make sure
through the search.                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                      
So the steps would be: use web_search with the query "largest island in the world", then parse the results to find the answer. Then use final_answer  
to present the result.                                                                                                                                
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the largest island in the world and then return the final answer.
