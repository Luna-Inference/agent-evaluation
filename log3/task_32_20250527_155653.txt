Okay, the user is asking for the smallest prime number. Let me think about how to approach this.                                                      
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I need to recall what a prime number is. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and      
itself. The smallest such number is 2. But wait, I should verify if 2 is indeed considered a prime. From what I remember, 2 is the smallest prime     
number because it's the first number after 1 that has exactly two distinct divisors.                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                      
But maybe I should check if there's any possibility that the user is referring to a different context. For example, sometimes in math, 1 is considered
a prime, but that's not the case here. The definition here is clear: primes are numbers greater than 1 with no divisors other than 1 and themselves.  
So 2 is the answer.                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                      
However, to be thorough, perhaps I should use a tool to confirm. The tools available are web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer. Since the       
question is straightforward, maybe a web search can confirm. But considering the tools, the web_search might return information about prime numbers.  
Alternatively, since the answer is a simple fact, maybe the code can directly output 2.                                                               
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the user might expect a code snippet that returns 2. But according to the rules, I need to use the tools provided. The tools include wiki and   
web_search. However, the question is a simple fact, so maybe the answer can be derived directly without using any tools. But the user might want to   
ensure accuracy.                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                      
Alternatively, perhaps the assistant should use the web_search tool to confirm. Let me think. The assistant can perform a web search for "smallest    
prime number" and retrieve the answer. But since the answer is a known fact, maybe the code can just output 2. However, the rules require using the   
tools if needed. But in this case, the answer is straightforward.                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                      
So, the thought process would be: the smallest prime number is 2. Therefore, the answer is 2. The code can directly print 2 using the final_answer    
function.                                                                                                                                             
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: The smallest prime number is 2, as it is the first number greater than 1 with no divisors other than 1 and itself. I will confirm this using 
the final_answer tool.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                      
Code:                                                                                                                                                 
```py                                                                                                                                                 
final_answer(2)                                                                                                                                       
```
