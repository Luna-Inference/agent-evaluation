<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Qatar. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have.                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I can use the web search tool to look up the capital of Qatar. The web_search function would be appropriate here. The query should be straightforward, like "capital of   
Qatar".                                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll call the web_search function with the query "capital of Qatar". Then, I'll check the results to find the answer. The top result should mention the capital. Once I get that 
information, I can present it as the final answer.
