<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking about the main language spoken in Egypt. Let me think about how to approach this.                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I need to find out what the primary language is in Egypt. I know that Egypt is a country in North Africa, and the main languages there are Arabic and Egyptian Arabic.    
However, I should verify this. Maybe I can use a web search to check the latest information.                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I should use the web_search tool to look up the main language in Egypt. The query could be something like "main language in Egypt". Let me perform the search and get the top    
results. Then, I can extract the information from the search results to determine the answer.                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the user might expect the answer to be Arabic, but I need to make sure. Sometimes, there are regional variations. For example, in some areas, other languages might be     
spoken, but the official language is still Arabic. So the main language is likely Arabic, but I should confirm through the search.                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Once I get the search results, I can check the top result or the first few entries to find the answer. If the search returns something like "Arabic is the official language of  
Egypt," then that's the answer. If not, maybe the search results mention Egyptian Arabic or other languages, but the main one is still Arabic.                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So the steps are: perform a web search for "main language in Egypt", parse the results to find the official language, and then return that as the answer.

Thought: I will use the web search tool to find the main language spoken in Egypt and then return the result.
