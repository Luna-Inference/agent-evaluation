<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking for the largest mammal. I need to figure out how to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have.              
                                                                                                                                                      
The available tools are web_search and visit_webpage, which can be used to look up information. Also, there's the final_answer tool to present the    
result.                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I should use web_search to find the largest mammal. The query should be something like "largest mammal" to get the top results. Then, I can    
parse the search results to extract the answer.                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the user might expect a specific answer, like the blue whale. But I need to make sure I get the correct information. Let me perform the web     
search first.                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                      
I'll call the web_search function with the query "largest mammal". Then, check the results to confirm the answer. Once I have the information, I can  
use the final_answer tool to present it.                                                                                                              
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the largest mammal and then return the final answer.
