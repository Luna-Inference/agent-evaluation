<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking who discovered gravity. I need to figure out the answer. Let me think.                                                       
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I remember that Isaac Newton is often associated with the discovery of gravity. But wait, there's also the work of Albert Einstein with general
relativity. However, the question is about "gravity" in a general sense. Historically, Newton's law of universal gravitation was the first major      
explanation. So maybe the answer is Isaac Newton.                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                      
But I should verify this. Since the tools available include web search, I can use the web_search function to check the historical context. Let me     
perform a web search to confirm.                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                      
So the plan is: use the web_search tool with the query "who discovered gravity" to get the top results. Then, analyze the results to determine the    
correct answer.                                                                                                                                       
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the answer to the question "who discovered gravity".

[Isaac Newton | Biography, Facts, Discoveries, Laws, & Inventions ...](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Isaac-Newton)
Isaac Newton (born December 25, 1642 [January 4, 1643, New Style], Woolsthorpe, Lincolnshire, England—died March 20 [March 31], 1727, London) was an 
English physicist and mathematician who was the culminating figure of the Scientific Revolution of the 17th century. In optics, his discovery of the 
composition of white light integrated the phenomena of colours into the science of light and ...
