<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking who painted the Mona Lisa. I need to figure out how to find this information. Let me think about the tools available.        
                                                                                                                                                      
The tools mentioned are web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer. So I can use web_search to look up the Mona Lisa's painter. The query should be  
straightforward. Maybe I can use the web_search function with the query "Who painted the Mona Lisa?".                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the user might expect a direct answer. But since the tools are limited, I have to use the web_search. Let me check if there's any need to visit 
a specific webpage. The web_search function would return the top results. Then I can parse those results to find the answer.                          
                                                                                                                                                      
I should call web_search with the query. Then, in the observation, the results will be printed. After getting the answer, I can use final_answer to   
present it. Let me write the code accordingly.                                                                                                        
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the answer about who painted the Mona Lisa.
