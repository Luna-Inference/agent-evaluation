Okay, the user is asking who wrote 'Anna Karenina'. I need to figure out the answer. I remember that 'Anna Karenina' is a novel by Leo Tolstoy. But maybe I should verify this   
using the available tools.                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I'll use the web search tool to look up the author of 'Anna Karenina'. The query would be something like "who wrote Anna Karenina". Let me check the results. If the      
search returns the correct information, I can confirm the author. If not, perhaps I need to try a different approach.                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the tools available include web_search and visit_webpage. So I can perform a web search to find the answer. Let me execute the code to search for the book's author.
