<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Bulgaria. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools available. The previous examples used web searches and wiki  
queries. Maybe I can use the web_search tool here.                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So, I should perform a web search for "capital of Bulgaria" to get the top results. The answer will be the first result from the search. Then, I can print that result and       
finally answer the question using the final_answer tool.                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the tools are web_search and visit_webpage, but the user might not have specified the exact URL. So, the code should be straightforward: call web_search with the query,   
then process the result. Let me write the code accordingly.                                                                                                                      
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the capital of Bulgaria.
