<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Albania. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have. The available tools are web search, visiting webpages,
and final answer.                                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I should use the web search tool to look up the capital of Albania. The query would be something like "capital of Albania". Let me check if there's a direct way to get   
this information. Since the user is asking for a straightforward answer, maybe a simple web search will suffice.                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll call the web_search function with the query "capital of Albania". Then, I can parse the results to find the capital. But according to the rules, I can't use any variables  
except those defined. So I need to make sure the code is correct.                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the tools are web_search and visit_webpage. The web_search returns the top results. Let me assume that the first result is the capital. So the code would be:              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
web_search("capital of Albania")                                                                                                                                                 
Then, in the observation, the result would be the capital. Finally, use the final_answer to return it.                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
But I need to make sure the code is properly structured. Let me write the code step by step.                                                                                     
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the capital of Albania.
