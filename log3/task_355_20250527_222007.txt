<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the main ingredient in plov. First, I need to figure out what plov is. Plov is a traditional Turkish dish, right? From what I remember, it's a type 
of meat dish. The main ingredients are usually lamb or beef. But I should verify this.                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Since I don't have a tool to look up recipes or food ingredients directly, I'll have to rely on my knowledge. Wait, the user might expect me to use a search tool. But according 
to the rules, I can only use the provided tools. The available tools are web_search and visit_webpage. So I should use web_search to find the recipe for plov.                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll perform a web search for "plov main ingredients" to get the answer. Then, I'll extract the information from the search results. If the search returns the ingredients, I can
confirm the main one. If not, maybe the search result will mention it. Once I have the answer, I can use the final_answer tool to present it.
