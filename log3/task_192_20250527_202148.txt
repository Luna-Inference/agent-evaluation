Okay, the user is asking for the capital of North Macedonia. Let me think about how to approach this.                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I need to find the capital city of North Macedonia. I remember that North Macedonia is a country in Europe, and its capital is Skopje. But I should verify this to make   
sure. Maybe I can use a web search to confirm the information.                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the tools available include a web search function. So I can use the web_search tool with the query "capital of North Macedonia". Let me check if that returns the correct  
result. If the search returns the capital as Skopje, then that's the answer. If not, maybe I need to look up more details. But given that I'm supposed to use the tools, I'll    
proceed with the web search.                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So the steps would be: perform a web search for the capital of North Macedonia, then extract the answer from the search results. Since the user is expecting a straightforward   
answer, the web search should return the correct information. Once I get the result, I can use the final_answer tool to provide the answer.
