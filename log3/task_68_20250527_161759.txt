<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of South Korea. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have. The available tools are
web_search and visit_webpage, which can retrieve information from the web. Since the answer is straightforward, I should use web_search with the query
"capital of South Korea".                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the user might want the most recent information. Let me check if there's a need for a specific source. But the tools don't have a specific      
source parameter, so just the query should suffice. I'll perform the search and get the top result. Then, I can extract the capital from the search   
results.                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
I should write a code snippet that uses web_search with the query. Then, parse the result to find the capital. But since the tools return the results 
as strings, I need to check the output. If the result contains the capital, like "Seoul", then that's the answer. Otherwise, maybe there's a mistake. 
But given that South Korea's capital is well-known, the search should return it.                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                      
So the code would be: call web_search with the query, then check the output for the capital. Then, use final_answer to present the answer.

Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the capital of South Korea.
