<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Cyprus. Let me think about how to approach this.                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I know that Cyprus is a country in Europe, and its capital is Cyprus City. But I should verify this to make sure. Since the user might want the most recent information, I
should check a reliable source.                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I can use the web search tool to look up the capital of Cyprus. The web search would return the top results. Let me perform a search with the query "capital of Cyprus".         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Once I get the search results, I can extract the capital from the first result. For example, if the search returns something like "The capital of Cyprus is Cyprus City.", then  
the answer is Cyprus City.                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I need to make sure that the information is accurate and up-to-date. Since the user didn't specify any particular date, assuming the current year (2023) is appropriate here. The
capital of Cyprus has been the same since independence in 1960, so there's no need for further verification.                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So the steps are: perform a web search for "capital of Cyprus", extract the capital from the first result, and return that as the answer.                                        
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web search tool to find the capital of Cyprus.
