<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking about the main ingredient in trdelnik. First, I need to figure out what "trdelnik" refers to. The term looks like a Slavic   
word, maybe a type of food. In some contexts, "trdelnik" could be a traditional dish, perhaps a type of pastry or bread.                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Since the user is asking for the main ingredient, I should start by searching for information about trdelnik. The tools available include web search  
and visiting webpages. So I'll use the web_search function with the query "trdelnik main ingredient".                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
I'll perform a web search to find out what trdelnik is made of. The results might mention the ingredients, like flour, butter, or other components.   
Once I get the search results, I can extract the main ingredient from the information provided.                                                       
                                                                                                                                                      
If the search returns a list of results, I'll need to parse them to find the key details. For example, if the search result says "trdelnik is a type  
of bread made with wheat flour and butter," then the main ingredient would be wheat flour or butter.                                                  
                                                                                                                                                      
I should also check if there are any specific regional variations, but the question doesn't mention any, so I'll assume a general case. If the search 
doesn't find direct information, maybe the term is a local or less-known dish, and the answer might require more context. However, given the tools    
available, the web_search should provide the necessary information.                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                      
Once the search is done, I'll process the results to determine the main ingredient and then return the answer using the final_answer tool.

Okay, so the user asked about the main ingredient in trdelnik. From the web search results, I need to figure out what's the primary component. Let's  
look at the search results.                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                      
The first result mentions that trdelnik is made with wheat white flour, sugar, salt, water, and yeast. Another source lists flour, sugar, salt, water,
and yeast as the main ingredients. A recipe from a Czech site lists flour as the primary ingredient, along with other components like milk, butter,   
sugar, and yeast. Another recipe mentions all-purpose flour, milk, butter, sugar, and yeast.                                                          
                                                                                                                                                      
So the main ingredient seems to be flour. Even though other ingredients like sugar, yeast, and milk are present, flour is the primary component. The  
answer should state that the main ingredient is flour.
