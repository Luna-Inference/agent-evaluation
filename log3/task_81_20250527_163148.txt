Okay, the user is asking for the largest bone in the human body. I need to figure out how to find that. I remember from biology that the femur is the 
largest, but maybe I should verify this.                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I should use a tool to search for this information. The available tools include web search and maybe others. Let me use the web_search         
function. The query should be "largest bone in the human body".                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the user might want the exact answer, so I need to make sure the search returns the correct result. Let me perform the search and get the top   
result. Then, I can extract the information from there.                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                      
Once I have the result, I can check if it's the femur. If the search returns something like "Femur is the largest bone...", then I can confirm that.  
If not, maybe there's another bone like the humerus or ulna. But generally, the femur is the largest.                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
I should also consider if there's any recent changes in bone sizes, but assuming the answer is standard. So the code will perform the search, parse   
the result, and then return the answer.                                                                                                               
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the largest bone in the human body.

temporal bone may be stronger. On average, the femur length accounts for 26.74% of a person's height, [ 4 ] a ratio found in both men and women across
most ethnic groups with minimal variation.
