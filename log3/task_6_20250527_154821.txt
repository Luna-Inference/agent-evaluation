<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, let's see. The user wants to translate 'Good morning' to Spanish. Hmm, I need to figure out the correct Spanish phrase for that. I remember that
'Good morning' in Spanish can be 'Buenos días' or 'Hola buen día'. Wait, 'Buenos días' is more common, especially in formal contexts. But maybe the   
user wants a more casual version. Let me check.                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the tools available here are web_search and final_answer. So maybe I should use web_search to find the correct translation. Let me think. The   
user might expect a straightforward answer, but since the tools are limited, I need to use the web_search function. Let me construct the code.        
                                                                                                                                                      
So the code would be something like:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                      
web_search(query="What is the translation of 'Good morning' to Spanish?")                                                                             
print(result)                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                      
Then, the result would be the answer. But I need to make sure the query is correct. The query should be "What is the translation of 'Good morning' to 
Spanish?" to get the top results. Once I get the result, I can use final_answer to present it. Let me write that code.                                
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the correct translation of "Good morning" to Spanish and then return the result.                      
Code:
