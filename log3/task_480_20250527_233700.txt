<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking who discovered Antarctica. Let me think about how to approach this.                                                          
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I need to find the historical information about the discovery of Antarctica. Since the tools available include web search and visiting         
webpages, I can use the web_search function. The query should be straightforward: "who discovered Antarctica".                                        
                                                                                                                                                      
I should perform a web search to get the relevant information. The result might mention that Antarctica was discovered by Robert Falcon Scott, but I  
need to confirm. Wait, actually, the correct answer is that Antarctica was discovered by Norwegian explorer Carl Reinhold Reiss in 1891. But I need to
verify this through the search tool.                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                      
So, I'll use the web_search function with the query "who discovered Antarctica" to get the top results. Then, I can parse the first result to find the
correct answer. If the search returns multiple sources, I'll pick the one that states the correct discoverer.

Okay, so the user asked who discovered Antarctica. I used the web search tool to find the answer. The search results mention that Edward Bransfield   
was an Irish-born English naval officer who was believed to have been the first to sight the Antarctic mainland. However, there's also mention of     
other explorers like Robert Falcon Scott and the Russian expedition. But the key point is that the discovery is often attributed to Edward Bransfield 
despite some conflicting claims. The search results also note that the exact discovery date and the exact person can be debated, but Bransfield is    
commonly cited as the first to see Antarctica.                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                      
So, the answer should state that Edward Bransfield is credited with discovering Antarctica, even though there are debates about the exact details. The
code snippet retrieved the information, and the observation shows the search results. Therefore, the final answer is Edward Bransfield.
