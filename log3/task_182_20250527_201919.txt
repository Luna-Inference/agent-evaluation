Okay, the user is asking who discovered the first antibiotic. I need to figure out the answer. From what I remember, the first antibiotic was penicillin, discovered by Alexander
Fleming in 1928. But I should verify this.                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the tools available include web search and wiki. So maybe I should use the web_search tool to check the exact information. Let me try that.                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll use the web_search function with the query "who discovered the first antibiotic". The result should give the correct answer. Once I get the result, I can extract the       
information and present it as the final answer.                                                                                                                                  
</think>
