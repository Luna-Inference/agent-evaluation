<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking who discovered electricity. I need to figure out the answer. Let's think.                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I remember that electricity was discovered by several scientists over time. The key figures are Benjamin Franklin, Alessandro Volta, and Thomas Edison. But the question  
is about who "discovered" it, which might be a bit ambiguous. However, the most commonly cited figure is Benjamin Franklin, who did experiments with electricity in the 1750s,   
like the kite and lightning rod experiments. He was the first to demonstrate that electricity and lightning are the same phenomenon.                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
But I should verify this. The tools available are web search and wiki. So I should use the web_search tool to check the most accurate answer. Let me perform a web search for    
"who discovered electricity" to get the top results. Then, I can use the information from the search to answer the question.                                                     
</think>
