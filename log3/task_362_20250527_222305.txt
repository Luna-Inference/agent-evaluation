Okay, the user is asking who discovered the law of conservation of energy in quantum mechanics. Let me think about how to approach this.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I need to recall what the law of conservation of energy states. In classical mechanics, it's a fundamental principle that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only     
transformed. But in quantum mechanics, the concept is slightly different. However, the question is about who discovered it in the context of quantum mechanics.                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the law of conservation of energy is a fundamental principle in physics, not just limited to quantum mechanics. However, the question specifically mentions quantum        
mechanics, so I need to determine if the law was discovered by someone in that context.                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
In classical physics, the law was formulated by Isaac Newton. But in the context of quantum mechanics, the development of the law might have been influenced by quantum          
mechanics. However, the law itself is a general principle.                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, but the question is about who discovered it in quantum mechanics. Maybe the answer is that it's a general principle, but the person who first formulated it in the context 
of quantum mechanics might be someone like Max Planck or Einstein.                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the conservation of energy in the context of quantum mechanics, which is still the same principle. So the discoverer might be
Newton, but in the context of quantum mechanics, maybe it's a different figure.                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, but the law of conservation of energy is a fundamental principle in both classical and quantum mechanics. So the answer might be that it was discovered by Newton, but in  
the context of quantum mechanics, it's still the same law.                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
However, the user is asking specifically about quantum mechanics. So maybe the answer is that the law was discovered by Newton, but in the context of quantum mechanics, it's    
still the same principle.                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Alternatively, perhaps the question is a trick question, and the answer is that it's a general principle discovered by Newton, but in the context of quantum mechanics, it's     
still the same.                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
But I need to verify this. Let me think about the history. The law of conservation of energy was first formulated by Newton in his classical mechanics. In the context of quantum
mechanics, the principle is still the same, but the way it's applied or understood might differ.                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So the answer is that the law of conservation of energy was discovered by Isaac Newton in classical mechanics, and in the context of quantum mechanics, it's still the same      
principle. Therefore, the answer would be Newton.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
But maybe the question is looking for someone else. For example, in the development of quantum mechanics, Einstein's theory of relativity also involved conservation laws, but   
the law of conservation of energy itself is a general principle.                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the conservation of energy in the context of quantum mechanics, which is still the same as in classical mechanics. So the    
answer is Newton.                                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Therefore, the final answer should be that the law was discovered by Isaac Newton.                                                                                               
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I need to find the discoverer of the law of conservation of energy in quantum mechanics. Since this is a general principle, the answer is likely Newton, but I should   
verify via research.

Julius Mayer, a German physicist, was the first person to state the law of the conservation of energy, in an 1842 scientific paper. Mayer experimentally determined the 
mechanical equivalent of heat from the heat evolved in the compression of a gas (without appreciating that heat could be explained in terms of kinetic theory). ...

One would have thought that the conservation of energy was discovered from the conservation of mechanical energy, but that was not really the case. The conservation of 
mechanical energy has actually played only a very minor role. Carnot made the link between work and kinetic energy quite early, but it was not until the 1820s before this link

(There are ways in classical mechanics to do an analogous thing to what we will do in quantum mechanics, but it can be done only at a very advanced level.) In quantum mechanics,
however, the conservation laws are very deeply related to the principle of superposition of amplitudes, and to the symmetry of physical systems under various changes.

[Who Discovered the Law of Conservation of Energy? (Description)](https://thepowerfacts.com/who-discovered-the-law-of-conservation-of-energy/)
In 1845, German physician Julius Robert von Mayer discovered the law of conservation of energy while studying human metabolism. This discovery led to the development of the first law of thermodynamics. The law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, but it can be converted from one form to another.

aboard a Dutch ship he discovered the law of conservation of energy, by a sudden intuition. This great discovery, comparable in its suddenness to a religious conversion, occurred while he was in the harbor of Surabaya (N. E. Java) in July I840. His whole life was henceforth devoted to the development and defense of
