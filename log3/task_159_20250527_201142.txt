<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Serbia. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have. The available tools are web_search and visit_webpage,  
which can be used to look up information. Since the question is straightforward, I can use a web search to find the capital.                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I'll use the web_search function with the query "capital of Serbia". The result should give the answer directly. Once I get the search results, I can extract the capital 
from the first result. Then, I'll use the final_answer tool to present the answer.
