<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the chemical symbol of manganese. I need to figure out what that is. I remember that manganese is a metal, and its symbol is Mn. But maybe I should 
verify this using a tool to be sure. Let me think about the tools available.                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The available tools are web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer. Since the user wants the chemical symbol, a quick web search would be appropriate. I can use the web_search 
function with the query "chemical symbol for manganese".                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, but maybe the web_search returns the symbol directly. Let me check. If the search results include the symbol, then I can extract it. But since I can't see the results,    
I'll have to assume that the search will return the correct information. Alternatively, I can use the knowledge that manganese's symbol is Mn. But to be thorough, using the     
web_search tool is better.                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So, the code would be to perform a web search for the chemical symbol of manganese and then return the result. If the search returns the symbol, then the answer is              
straightforward. If not, maybe there's a need to check another source. But given the tools available, the web_search should suffice.                                             
</think>
