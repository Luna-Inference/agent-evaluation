<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking who wrote "One Hundred Years of Solitude." Let me think about how to approach this.                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I need to find the author of that book. Since I can use web search tools, I should perform a search to find the author. The tools available include web_search and        
visit_webpage. The web_search function can be used with the query "One Hundred Years of Solitude author."                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I should call the web_search function with the appropriate query. The result will give me the author's name. Once I have that, I can present it as the final answer.             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the user might expect a direct answer. Let me make sure the search is accurate. The book is a classic, so the author is Gabriel García Márquez. But to be thorough, I      
should use the search tool to confirm.                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So the steps are: use web_search with the query, get the result, and then output the author's name. Since the tools are notional, I'll code the search and then return the       
answer.                                                                                                                                                                          
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web search tool to find the author of "One Hundred Years of Solitude."
