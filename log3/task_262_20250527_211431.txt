Okay, the user is asking for the chemical symbol of nitrogen. I need to figure out what that is. From what I remember, nitrogen is a chemical element with the symbol N. But     
maybe I should verify this using a tool to be sure.                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Looking at the tools available, there's the 'wiki' function which can look up information. So I'll use that. The query would be "chemical symbol for nitrogen". Let me check the 
wiki to confirm. If the wiki returns 'N', then that's the answer. If not, maybe there's a different symbol, but I think the standard is N. Wait, maybe I should also check the   
web search to be safe. But the user might just want the standard answer. Since the task is straightforward, using the wiki tool should suffice.

Okay, the user is asking for the chemical symbol of nitrogen. I need to provide the correct answer. From my knowledge, nitrogen's symbol is N. But since the previous attempt    
failed because the tool wasn't allowed, I should use a different approach. Maybe check a reliable source like a periodic table. Since the wiki tool wasn't available, I'll use a 
web search to find the answer. Let me perform a web search for "chemical symbol for nitrogen" and retrieve the result.
