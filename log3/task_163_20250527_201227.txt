<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking about the main ingredient in borscht. I need to figure out what the answer is. Borscht is a traditional Jewish soup with a spicy flavor. The main       
ingredients typically include vegetables, especially cabbage, and sometimes onions, peppers, and garlic. But I should verify this.                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I should search for reliable sources or information about the ingredients of borscht. Since the user might expect a specific answer, but I need to make sure it's         
accurate. The tools available include web search and maybe other functions. Let me use the web_search tool to find the answer.                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll use the web_search function with the query "main ingredient in borscht". Then, based on the results, determine the answer. If the search returns that cabbage is the main   
ingredient, that's the answer. If not, maybe check other ingredients like onions or peppers. But the most common answer is cabbage. So the code will perform the search and then 
provide the final answer.
