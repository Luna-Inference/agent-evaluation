<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Afghanistan. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools available. The user mentioned using web search and        
visiting webpages, so maybe I can use the web_search function.                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I should perform a web search for the capital of Afghanistan. The query would be something like "capital of Afghanistan". Then, I can retrieve the results and extract the
answer. Since the web_search function returns the top results, I'll check the first result to find the capital.                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the tools provided include web_search and visit_webpage. So I'll call web_search with the query "capital of Afghanistan". The results might include a list of cities, and  
the capital is usually the largest or the mentioned one. Let me check the first result. If the first result says "The capital of Afghanistan is Kabul.", then I can confirm that.
But if the search returns multiple results, I need to parse them. However, since the user expects a straightforward answer, maybe the first result is sufficient.                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Alternatively, maybe the web_search returns a string that directly states the capital. So I'll proceed by calling web_search with the query and then check the output. If the    
output contains the capital, I can use that. If not, maybe I need to visit the webpage and extract the information. But according to the tools, I can use the web_search function
directly.                                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So the code would be: call web_search with the query, then check the result. If the result contains the capital, return it. Otherwise, maybe there's a need to visit a specific  
page. But given the tools, I'll proceed with the web_search and then extract the answer from the results.                                                                        
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the capital of Afghanistan and then extract the answer from the results.
