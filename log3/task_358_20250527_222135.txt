Okay, the user is asking for the chemical symbol of cadmium. I need to figure out what that is. From what I remember, cadmium is a metal used in batteries and alloys. Its symbol
is Cd. But maybe I should verify this.                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the tools available are web search and visiting webpages. So perhaps I should use the web_search tool to look up the chemical symbol for cadmium. Let me check the tools   
again. The web_search function takes a query string. So I can use a query like "chemical symbol cadmium" to find the answer.                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Alternatively, maybe the user expects me to know this already. But since the task is to use the provided tools, I should proceed with searching. Let me write a code snippet     
using web_search with the query "chemical symbol cadmium" and then return the result.
