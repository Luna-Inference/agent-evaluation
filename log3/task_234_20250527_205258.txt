<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Oman. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have.                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I can use the web search tool to look up the capital of Oman. The web_search function would be appropriate here. The query should be "capital of Oman". Let me check if   
there's any existing data or if I need to perform a search.                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Since the user hasn't provided any specific tools related to geography, I'll proceed with a web search. The tool will return the top results. Once I get the result, I can       
extract the capital from the response.                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I should make sure to use the correct parameters for the web_search function. The query is straightforward. Let me write the code to perform the search and then process the     
answer.                                                                                                                                                                          
</think>
