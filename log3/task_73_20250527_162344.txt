<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking about the process of cell division. I need to figure out the correct term. From what I remember, cell division has two main  
types: mitosis and meiosis. Mitosis is for growing and repairing tissues, while meiosis is for producing gametes like eggs and sperm. But the question
is just asking for the process, not the types. So the answer should be mitosis. But wait, maybe I should verify this.                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
I should use the tool 'wiki' to get an accurate definition. Let me check the wiki for the term "cell division". The wiki might provide the correct    
answer. Let me call the wiki tool with the query "process of cell division".

[Cell division - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_division)
Cell division in prokaryotes (binary fission) and eukaryotes (mitosis and meiosis). The thick lines are chromosomes, and the thin blue lines are 
fibers pulling on the chromosomes and pushing the ends of the cell apart. ... Cell division is the process by which a parent cell divides into two 
daughter cells. [1] Cell division usually occurs as ...

Cell division, or mitosis, is the process by which a mother cell divides its nuclear and cytoplasmic components into two daughter cells. Mitosis is 
divided into four major phases: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. Careful regulation of the cell division program is crucial for proper 
cell growth, development, and gametogenesis.

[Types of Cell Division - BYJU'S](https://byjus.com/biology/cell-division/)
Types of Cell Division. There are two distinct types of cell division out of which the first one is vegetative division, wherein each daughter cell 
duplicates the parent cell called mitosis. The second one is meiosis, which divides into four haploid daughter cells. Mitosis: The process cells use 
to make exact replicas of themselves. Mitosis is ...

ion)
The Cell Cycle. Cell division is the process in which one cell, called the parent cell, divides to form two new cells, referred to as daughter cells. 
How this happens depends on whether the cell is prokaryotic or eukaryotic. Cell division is simpler in prokaryotes than eukaryotes because prokaryotic
cells themselves are simpler.
