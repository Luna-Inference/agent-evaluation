Okay, the user is asking who discovered X-rays. I need to find the answer using the tools available. Let me think about the steps.                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I should use the web search tool to look up the discovery of X-rays. The query should be straightforward. Maybe something like "who discovered X-rays". Then, I can       
retrieve the results and extract the information.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the tools mentioned include web_search and visit_webpage. So I can call web_search with the query. Once I get the results, I need to parse them to find the correct answer.
The answer is likely the first result, but I should check multiple sources to confirm.                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Alternatively, maybe the wiki tool can provide more accurate information. But since the user didn't specify, starting with web_search is better. Let me write the code to perform
the search and then extract the answer.                                                                                                                                          
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the answer about who discovered X-rays.
