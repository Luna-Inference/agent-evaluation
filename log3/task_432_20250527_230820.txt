<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of the Netherlands. Let me think about how to approach this.                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I know that the capital of the Netherlands is Amsterdam. But maybe I should verify this using a reliable source. Since the user might want the 
most accurate answer, I should use a web search to confirm.                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                      
I'll use the web_search tool with the query "capital of Netherlands". The tool will return the top results. Then I can extract the capital from the   
search results.                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the tools available are web_search and visit_webpage. So I need to perform a web search and then parse the results. Let me write code to do     
that.                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
I'll call web_search with the query "capital of Netherlands". Then, in the observation, I'll check the results. The first result might be the correct 
one. If the first result is the capital, I can final answer with that. If not, maybe the second result is correct. But since the user expects a       
straightforward answer, maybe the first result is sufficient.                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                      
So the code would be:                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
web_search("capital of Netherlands")                                                                                                                  
Then, check the first result's content. If it says Amsterdam, then final answer Amsterdam. Otherwise, maybe the second result. But since the user's   
question is straightforward, I'll assume the first result is correct.                                                                                 
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the capital of the Netherlands and then return the result.

final_answer(capital)
