<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking for the tallest mountain in the world. I need to figure out how to get that information. Let me think about the tools        
available.                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                      
The tools mentioned are web_search and visit_webpage, which can be used to look up information. Also, there's the final_answer tool to present the    
result.                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I should use the web_search function with the query "tallest mountain in the world". The previous examples show that searching with a query    
returns the top results. So I'll perform a web search for that term.                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                      
Once I get the search results, I need to extract the information about the tallest mountain. The results might include sources like geological surveys
or travel websites. The tallest mountain is Mount Everest, but I should confirm the latest data.                                                      
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the user might want the most recent information. Maybe the web search will provide the latest details. Let me run the search and then process   
the results to find the answer.                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                      
I should check the first few results to see which one mentions Mount Everest as the tallest. If the search returns multiple results, I need to        
identify the correct one.                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                      
Once I have the answer, I can use the final_answer tool to present it. The answer should be straightforward, like "Mount Everest" or "Mount Everest is
the tallest mountain in the world".                                                                                                                   
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the tallest mountain in the world and then extract the answer.
