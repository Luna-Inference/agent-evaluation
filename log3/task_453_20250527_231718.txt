<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Poland. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have available. There's the wiki  
tool, which can be used to look up information. Also, web search tools, but since the question is straightforward, maybe the wiki tool is sufficient. 
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I should check if the wiki tool can provide the capital of Poland. The wiki tool's query would be "capital of Poland". Let me call that        
function. If the wiki returns the correct information, I can use that. If not, maybe I need to use a web search. But given that the user is asking for
a known fact, the wiki tool should handle it.                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                      
So, the code would be to call the wiki function with the query "capital of Poland". Then, based on the response, I can provide the answer. If the wiki
returns the capital, like Warsaw, then that's the answer. If not, maybe a web search would be necessary. But since the user's question is simple, the 
wiki should work.

Thought: I will use the `wiki` tool to find the capital of Poland.

Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Poland. Earlier, I tried using the `wiki` tool but got an error because the function wasn't allowed. Now, 
I need to find another way to get the answer without using the `wiki` tool.                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                      
Since the user's question is straightforward, maybe I can use a web search to find the capital. The `web_search` tool can be used here. Let me check  
the parameters. The query should be "capital of Poland", and I can retrieve the top results. Then, I can extract the capital from the search results. 
                                                                                                                                                      
I'll write code to perform a web search with that query, then parse the results to find the capital. If the search returns the correct information, I 
can present it as the answer. If not, maybe I need to try a different approach, but given the simplicity of the question, the web search should work.
