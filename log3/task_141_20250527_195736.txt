<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Poland. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have.                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I can use the web search tool to look up the capital of Poland. The web_search function would be appropriate here. The query should be "capital of Poland". Let me check  
if there's any need for translation or additional steps. The user didn't specify any particular language, so I'll just use the default.                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll call the web_search function with the query. Then, I'll process the result to extract the capital. The result might be a string like "Warsaw" or similar. Once I have that, 
I can present it as the final answer.                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the tools mentioned include web_search and visit_webpage. But the user didn't mention any specific website, so I'll just use the web_search function. Let me make sure the 
code is correct. The code should be straightforward: search for the capital of Poland, then output the result.                                                                   
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the capital of Poland.
