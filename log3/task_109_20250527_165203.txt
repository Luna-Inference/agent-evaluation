<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking about the process by which ice turns to water. I need to figure out how to explain this. From what I know, ice turning into  
water is a phase change called melting. But maybe they want a more detailed explanation, like the specific steps or the role of heat.                 
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the question is about the process, so I should explain the physical changes involved. When ice (which is solid water) melts, it absorbs heat    
energy. The molecules in ice move more freely, breaking the rigid structure of the solid. This is called melting. The temperature remains constant    
because the energy is used to break the bonds rather than increase the temperature.                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                      
But maybe the user wants to know the scientific terms or the actual process. I should confirm if there's a specific term like "fusion" or "melting"   
they're looking for. Since the question is straightforward, the answer is the melting process. However, to be thorough, I should check if there's any 
additional steps or factors involved, like the role of heat or the molecular structure.                                                               
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the tools available are web search and visit_webpage. Maybe I should use a web search to get the exact process description. Let me try that. The
query would be "process by which ice turns to water". The result should explain melting, fusion, and the energy required. Then I can summarize that   
process.                                                                                                                                              
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the web search tool to get the detailed process description of ice melting and then summarize the answer.

Okay, the web search tool didn't work again. Maybe I need a different approach. Let me think. The user is asking about the process of ice turning into
water. I know that this is called melting. But maybe I can explain it using known scientific principles without searching.                            
                                                                                                                                                      
When ice (solid water) melts, it absorbs heat energy. The molecules in the ice structure break their bonds, allowing them to move more freely. This is
called fusion. The temperature remains constant because the energy goes into breaking the bonds rather than increasing the temperature.               
                                                                                                                                                      
Since the web search failed, I'll explain this directly. The process involves the absorption of heat energy to break the crystalline structure of ice,
leading to the formation of liquid water. I'll summarize this in the final answer.
