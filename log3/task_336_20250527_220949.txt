<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Tuvalu. I need to figure out how to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have available.                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I remember that the user mentioned using web search and visiting webpages. In the previous examples, the assistant used the web_search function to get information. So    
maybe I should use that here. The capital of Tuvalu is a straightforward question, but I need to make sure I get the correct answer.                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the tools available are web_search and visit_webpage. The web_search function takes a query string. So I can use web_search with the query "capital of Tuvalu" to find the 
answer. Alternatively, maybe visiting a specific webpage would be better, but since the user didn't provide a specific URL, using web_search makes sense.                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I should call web_search with the query "capital of Tuvalu" and then process the results. The observation will give the top results, and from there, I can extract the capital.  
But in the code, I need to make sure that the web_search returns the correct information. Let me write the code for that.                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So the code would be something like:                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
pope_age_wiki = wiki(query="current pope age")                                                                                                                                   
print("Pope age as per wikipedia:", pope_age_wiki)                                                                                                                               
pope_age_search = web_search(query="current pope age")                                                                                                                           
print("Pope age as per google search:", pope_age_search)                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, but in this case, the user is asking about Tuvalu's capital. So the code should be:                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
web_search("capital of Tuvalu") and then extract the answer from the results. But since the tools return the results as strings, I need to parse them. However, in the previous  
examples, the assistant used print statements to output the results, which were then used in the next steps. So maybe the code would be:                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
code:                                                                                                                                                                            
```py                                                                                                                                                                            
result = web_search(query="capital of Tuvalu")                                                                                                                                   
final_answer(result)                                                                                                                                                             
```                                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
But I need to make sure that the web_search returns the correct answer. If the search returns the capital, then that's the answer. If not, maybe I need to check more details.   
But given that this is a straightforward question, the web_search should suffice.                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So the final answer would be the result of the web_search.

Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the capital of Tuvalu.
