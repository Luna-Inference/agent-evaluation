<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Monaco. Let me think about how to approach this.                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I know that Monaco is a small country in Europe, and its capital is Monte Carlo. But maybe I should verify this using a reliable source. Since the user might want an     
accurate answer, I should use a web search to confirm.                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Looking at the tools available, there's a web_search function. So I'll use that to look up the capital of Monaco. The query would be "capital of Monaco". Let me check the       
results. If the search returns that Monte Carlo is the capital, then I can confirm it. Alternatively, if there's a different result, I might need to check another source, but   
for now, the web_search should give the correct information.                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Once I get the result, I can directly answer the question using the final_answer tool.                                                                                           
</think>
