<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Mongolia. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have.                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Hmm, the available tools are web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer. Since the question is straightforward, maybe a web search would work. I can use the web_search function
with the query "capital of Mongolia".                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, but maybe I should check if there's a specific tool for geographical information. However, the tools provided don't include a specific geographical database, so the best  
approach is to use web_search.                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll perform the search and get the result. Then, I can extract the capital from the search results. The answer should be the capital city, which is Ulaanbaatar. But I need to  
make sure the search returns that information.                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Alternatively, if the web_search returns the correct answer, I can directly use it. Since the user expects a simple answer, I'll proceed with the web search and then provide the
final answer.                                                                                                                                                                    
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the capital of Mongolia.
