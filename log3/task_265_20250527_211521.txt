<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking about the main ingredient in sushi. I need to figure out what that is. From what I remember, sushi is typically made with rice, but I should verify     
this.                                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I should check if there's a tool available to look up this information. The available tools are web_search and visit_webpage. So I can use web_search with the query "main
ingredient in sushi".                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Let me perform the search. The results might mention that rice is the primary ingredient. But I need to make sure. Sometimes sushi can have different variations, like with      
vegetables or fish, but the main one is rice.                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Once I get the search results, I can extract the main ingredient. If the search returns something like "The main ingredient in sushi is rice", then that's the answer. If there's
more context, like different types of sushi, I should mention that rice is the base.                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the user might be looking for the most common answer, which is rice. So the final answer should be rice. But I need to make sure the search confirms this.                 
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the `web_search` tool to find the main ingredient in sushi.
