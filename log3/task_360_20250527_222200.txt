<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Turkmenistan. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have.                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I can use the web search tool to look up the capital. The previous examples show that when a search is needed, the code uses the web_search function. So I'll try that.   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll call web_search with the query "capital of Turkmenistan". Then, the result should give me the answer. Once I get the result, I can extract the capital from the search      
results.                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the tools mentioned include a function called web_search which returns the top results. So the code would be something like:                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
result = web_search("capital of Turkmenistan")                                                                                                                                   
print(result)                                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Then, I need to parse the result to find the capital. But since the observation is what's returned, I'll check the output. If the first result is the capital, I can final_answer
it.                                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Alternatively, if the search returns multiple entries, I'll need to pick the correct one. But in the previous example, the observation was a single line. So assuming the first  
result is the correct one.                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So the code would be:                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
result = web_search("capital of Turkmenistan")                                                                                                                                   
final_answer(result)                                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
But I need to make sure the answer is correctly extracted. If the search returns something like "The capital of Turkmenistan is Ashgabat.", then the answer is Ashgabat.         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
But since the user's task is to provide the answer, I'll proceed with the code that calls web_search and then final_answer with the result.                                      
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the capital of Turkmenistan.
