<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking who wrote 'Frankenstein'. I need to find the answer using the tools provided. Let me think about the steps.                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I should use the web search tool to look up the answer. The query would be "who wrote Frankenstein". The tool 'web_search' can handle this. Then, I can retrieve the      
results and extract the information. Since the answer is straightforward, once I get the result from the search, I can directly answer the question.                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I need to make sure that the code uses the correct tool and parameters. The function 'web_search' takes a query string. So the code would be something like:                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
web_search(query="who wrote Frankenstein")                                                                                                                                       
Then, print the result to get the answer. Finally, use the final_answer tool to present the answer.                                                                              
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web search tool to find the answer to the question "Who wrote Frankenstein".
