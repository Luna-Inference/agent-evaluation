Okay, the user wants me to define 'photosynthesis'. I need to figure out how to approach this. Since this is a general knowledge question, I probably don't need to use any of   
the provided tools like web search or image processing. But let me think.                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Photosynthesis is a process that plants use to convert light energy into chemical energy. I remember from biology classes that it occurs in chloroplasts, and the main components
are sunlight, water, carbon dioxide, and glucose. The chemical equation is something like 6CO2 + 6H2O + light → C6H12O6 + 6O2. But I should make sure I'm accurate.              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the user might expect a concise definition. So I should outline the main points: plants using sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. Also,  
mention the location (chloroplasts) and the role of chlorophyll. Maybe include the chemical equation as a brief summary.                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Since there's no tool provided for searching definitions, I can just provide the information I know. But I should check if there's any tool I can use. The tools mentioned       
earlier were for web searches, image processing, and others. Since the user hasn't specified any tools to use, perhaps I can just answer directly.                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So the final answer would be a clear, concise definition including the process, the components, and the products. I need to make sure it's correct and easy to understand.
