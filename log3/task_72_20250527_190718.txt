Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Italy. I need to find that out. I remember that the capital of Italy is Rome. But maybe I should verify this using a tool to be sure.
Let me check.                                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I'll use the web search tool to look up the capital of Italy. The query would be "capital of Italy". Let me run that. The result should confirm that Rome is the capital. 
Once I have that information, I can directly answer the question.
