<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Luxembourg. I need to figure out how to find that information. Let me think about the tools available.                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I remember that the user has access to a search tool, which can be used to look up information. The tools mentioned include web_search and visit_webpage, which might help
retrieve the answer. Since the question is straightforward, I can use the web_search function with the query "capital of Luxembourg" to get the result.                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I should check if there's any need to parse the web search results. The observation from the previous example showed that the search results can be printed directly. So, I'll   
perform the search and then print the result to extract the capital.                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the user's task is to provide the answer, so after getting the result from the search, I can use the final_answer function to output the capital. Let me make sure the code
is structured correctly with the necessary steps.                                                                                                                                
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the capital of Luxembourg and then return the answer.
