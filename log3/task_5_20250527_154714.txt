Okay, I need to list the first 5 prime numbers. Let's think about how to approach this.                                                               
                                                                                                                                                      
Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. The first few primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc. So the first
five should be 2, 3, 5, 7, 11.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                      
But how to generate this using Python code? Well, I can create a list starting from 2 and check each number to see if it's prime. The check for       
primality can be done by testing divisibility up to the square root of the number. Alternatively, since the first five primes are known, maybe I can  
just hardcode them. But the user might want a general solution.                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the task says "List the first 5 prime numbers." So maybe the best way is to generate them using a simple loop. Let me think of a method.        
                                                                                                                                                      
Start with a list. Initialize it with 2, then check each number sequentially. For each number, check if it's divisible by any number from 2 up to its 
square root. If not, add it to the list.                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
But for the first five primes, maybe it's easier to just hardcode them. However, the user might expect a code that generates them. Let's write a code 
that generates the first five primes.                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
So the steps would be:                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                      
1. Initialize a list with the first prime number (2).                                                                                                 
2. Check each subsequent number (3, 4, 5, ...) to see if it's prime.                                                                                  
3. Add to the list if it's prime.                                                                                                                     
4. Stop when the list has five elements.                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Alternatively, since the first five primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, I can just print them directly. But perhaps the user wants a code that can handle      
larger numbers, but for the first five, it's straightforward.                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                      
So the code would be:                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
Start with a list, check each number, and add to the list if prime. Let's implement that.                                                             
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, but how to check if a number is prime. Let's write a helper function. For each number n, check if any number from 2 to sqrt(n) divides it. If   
none, it's prime.                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                      
So the code steps:                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                      
- Create a list of primes.                                                                                                                            
- Start with 2.                                                                                                                                       
- For each number starting from 3, check if it's prime.                                                                                               
- If yes, add to the list.                                                                                                                            
- Continue until the list has 5 elements.                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                      
Let me write the code.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                      
First, define a function to check if a number is prime. Then, generate the primes.                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                      
But since the user might not want a function, maybe just check sequentially.                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                      
Alternatively, use a loop from 2 upwards, and collect primes until we have five.                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                      
So code:                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
primes = []                                                                                                                                           
num = 2                                                                                                                                               
while len(primes) < 5:                                                                                                                                
    if is_prime(num):                                                                                                                                 
        primes.append(num)                                                                                                                            
    num += 1                                                                                                                                          
print(primes)                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                      
But I need to implement is_prime. Let's write that.                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                      
def is_prime(n):                                                                                                                                      
    if n < 2:                                                                                                                                         
        return False                                                                                                                                  
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):                                                                                                               
        if n % i == 0:                                                                                                                                
            return False                                                                                                                              
    return True                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                      
Then, in the main code, use this function.                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                      
But in the code, I need to make sure that the code is correct. Let's test this logic.                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
For num=2, is_prime returns True. So primes starts with 2. Then 3, which is prime. Then 4, which is not. 5 is prime. So the first five primes would be
2, 3, 5, 7, 11. Wait, but when num is 5, the loop would check up to sqrt(5) ~ 2.236, so check 2. 5%2 is 1, so it's prime. Then next is 6, which is    
not. 7 is prime. So the code would collect 2, 3, 5, 7, 11. So the first five primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11.                                               
                                                                                                                                                      
So the code would generate that. Therefore, the final answer is the list [2, 3, 5, 7, 11].                                                            
                                                                                                                                                      
But the user wants the list, so the code would print that. So the code would be:                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                      
primes = []                                                                                                                                           
num = 2                                                                                                                                               
while len(primes) < 5:                                                                                                                                
    if is_prime(num):                                                                                                                                 
        primes.append(num)                                                                                                                            
    num += 1                                                                                                                                          
print(primes)                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                      
But I need to implement is_prime. Let's code that.                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                      
Putting it all together, the code would be:

    if is_prime(num):

print(primes)                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                      
But in the code, I need to make sure that the functions are defined. However, the tools available are the web_search, visit_webpage, final_answer,    
etc. But in this case, the code is just Python code, so the functions are part of the code.                                                           
                                                                                                                                                      
But according to the rules, I can use imports, but the code can use the functions as defined. So the code is valid.                                   
                                                                                                                                                      
So the final answer would be the list [2, 3, 5, 7, 11].

Thought: I will generate the first 5 prime numbers by checking each number sequentially and verifying if it's prime. I'll use a helper function to    
check for primality and collect the primes until the list has 5 elements.
