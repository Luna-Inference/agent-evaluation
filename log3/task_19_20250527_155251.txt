Okay, the user is asking for the speed of light. I need to find out what that is. I remember that the speed of light in a vacuum is a fundamental     
constant. But maybe I should verify it using a reliable source.                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I can use the web search tool to look up the speed of light. Let me check the top results. The Wikipedia page might have the exact value.      
Alternatively, a Google search could give the same information. The user probably expects the standard value, which is approximately 299,792,458      
meters per second. But I should make sure to get the most accurate figure possible.                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the tools available include web_search and visit_webpage. So I can perform a web search with the query "speed of light". The result should      
provide the exact value. Once I get that, I can present it as the answer. Let me write the code to do that.                                           
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the exact speed of light and then return the result.
