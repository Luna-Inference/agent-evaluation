<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking who wrote "Jane Eyre". I need to figure out how to find this information. Let me think about the tools available.                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I can use the web search tool to look up the author of "Jane Eyre". The query should be straightforward. Maybe something like "author of Jane Eyre" or "who wrote Jane    
Eyre". Since the user mentioned using the web search tool, I'll try that.                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I should check if there's any existing information or if the search returns the correct result. If the search returns the author's name, then I can present that as the answer.  
If not, maybe I need to refine the search query.                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the tools allowed are web_search and visit_webpage. So I'll use web_search with the query "author of Jane Eyre". The result should give the answer directly. Once I get the
result, I can extract the author's name and return it.                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I need to make sure the code is correct. The code should call web_search with the right parameters. Let me write the code now.                                                   
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the author of "Jane Eyre".
