Okay, the user is asking for the symbol of potassium. I need to figure out what the correct symbol is. From what I remember, potassium is a chemical element. The symbols for    
elements are usually one or two letters. Let me think... I think potassium is K. But wait, maybe I should verify this.                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Hmm, I can use the web search tool to check the exact symbol. Let me perform a search for "symbol for potassium" to confirm. If I find the answer, I can then use the            
final_answer function to provide the result. Let me write the code for that.
