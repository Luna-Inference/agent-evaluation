Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Argentina. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have.                          
                                                                                                                                                      
The available tools are web_search and visit_webpage. Maybe a web search would be the best approach here. I can use the web_search function with the  
query "capital of Argentina".                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the user might want the most recent information. So I should perform a search and then retrieve the result. Let me write a code snippet that    
uses web_search with the correct query.                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                      
I should make sure to call the web_search function with the right parameters. The query is "capital of Argentina". Then, once I get the result, I can 
extract the capital from the search results.                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                      
But according to the rules, I can't store the result in a variable unless I define it. So I'll use print to output the result directly. Then, I can   
use the final_answer tool to provide the answer.                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the code needs to end with

Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Argentina. The previous attempt used web_search with the query "capital of Argentina", but it resulted in 
a ratelimit error. That means the search tool was blocked due to too many requests. I need to find another way to get the information.                
                                                                                                                                                      
Since web_search is not working, maybe I can use a different approach. The capital of Argentina is Buenos Aires. But I need to confirm this.          
Alternatively, maybe the user expects me to know this answer directly. However, the rules require using the tools provided. Since the web_search      
failed, perhaps I should try a different query or use a different tool if available.                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the available tools are web_search and visit_webpage. Maybe I can use visit_webpage to browse a reliable source. For example, checking a trusted
website like Wikipedia. But the tools don't have a specific Wikipedia function. However, the user's previous example used web_search, so maybe I can  
try again with a different query.                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                      
Alternatively, maybe the answer is known and I can provide it directly. But according to the rules, I need to use the tools. Since the web_search is  
failing, perhaps I should try a different query. Let me try "capital of Argentina" again, but maybe with a different parameter. Or perhaps the error  
was due to the query being too broad. Maybe narrowing it down.                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the error was a ratelimit, so maybe the search tool is rate-limited. Let me try a different query, like "Argentina capital" to see if that      
works. If that fails again, maybe the answer is known and I can provide it directly. But the rules say to use the tools. So perhaps I can use the     
final_answer tool with the known answer.

the rules require using the tools. Since the web_search is failing, maybe I can proceed with the known answer.                                        
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the user's task is to answer the question using the tools. If the tools aren't working, maybe the answer is known. But according to the rules, I
need to use the tools.

But the user's previous example used the final_answer with the result from the search. Since the search is failing, maybe the answer is known. So I   
can use the final_answer with "Buenos Aires".

Thought: The web_search tool is rate-limited, so I'll provide the known answer directly using the final_answer tool. The capital of Argentina is      
Buenos Aires.
