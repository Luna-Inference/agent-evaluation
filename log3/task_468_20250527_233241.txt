<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Mongolia. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have.                           
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I can use the web search tool to look up the capital of Mongolia. The web_search function would be appropriate here. The query should be       
"capital of Mongolia". Let me check if there's any existing data or if I need to perform a search.                                                    
                                                                                                                                                      
Since the user wants the answer, I'll use the web_search tool with the query. Then, I can retrieve the result and extract the capital from the search 
results. If the search returns the capital directly, I can just use that. If not, maybe I need to parse the result. But given that the answer is      
straightforward, the web_search should return the capital as the first result.                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                      
So, the code would be something like:                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
pope_age_wiki = wiki(query="current pope age")                                                                                                        
print("Pope age as per wikipedia:", pope_age_wiki)                                                                                                    
pope_age_search = web_search(query="current pope age")                                                                                                
print("Pope age as per google search:", pope_age_search)                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, but the current task is about the capital of Mongolia. So the query should be "capital of Mongolia". Let me adjust the code accordingly. The    
web_search function would take the query as "capital of Mongolia" and return the top result. Then, I can extract the capital from that result.        
                                                                                                                                                      
I need to make sure that the web_search returns the correct information. If the search result is a string containing the capital, like "Ulaanbaatar is
the capital of Mongolia.", then I can split the string or use string manipulation to get the capital. But since the user is expecting a direct answer,
maybe the web_search returns the capital as the first part of the result.                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                      
So the code would be:                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
capital = web_search("capital of Mongolia")                                                                                                           
final_answer(capital)                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
But I need to ensure that the web_search returns the correct value. Let me check if there's any need for further steps. Since the answer is           
straightforward, this should suffice.                                                                                                                 
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the web search tool to find the capital of Mongolia.
