<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking who discovered penicillin. I need to find the answer using the tools available. Let me think about the steps.                
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I should use a search tool to look up the discovery of penicillin. The tools provided include web_search and visit_webpage. Since the question 
is about a historical fact, a web search would be appropriate. The query should be "who discovered penicillin".                                       
                                                                                                                                                      
I'll call the web_search function with that query. The result will give me the answer. Once I get the result, I can extract the name from the top     
search results. Then, I can use the final_answer tool to present the answer.                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the user's tools don't have a specific function for getting the top results, but the web_search function returns the top results as a string. So
I can parse that string to find the name. Let me write the code to perform the search and then extract the information.                               
</think>
