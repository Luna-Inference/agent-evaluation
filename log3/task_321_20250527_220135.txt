<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Kiribati. Let me think about how to approach this.                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I need to recall if I have any existing knowledge about Kiribati's capital. From what I remember, Kiribati is a country in Oceania, and its capital is Ngerulmara. But I  
should verify this to make sure.                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Since the user might expect an accurate answer, I should use a reliable method to find the information. The available tools include web search and visiting webpages. So, I can  
perform a web search to confirm the capital.                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll use the web_search function with the query "capital of Kiribati". The result should provide the correct information. Once I get the result, I can extract the capital from  
the search results and present it as the final answer.                                                                                                                           
</think>
