<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Denmark. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools available. The previous examples used web searches and wiki   
lookups. Since Denmark's capital is a well-known fact, maybe a web search would work. But maybe the wiki tool can also help. Let me check the tools again.                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The available tools are web_search and wiki. The web_search function takes a query, so I can use that with the query "capital of Denmark". The wiki tool would also be possible, 
but maybe the web search is more straightforward here. However, the user might expect a direct answer. Let me try the web search first.                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So, the code would be something like: perform a web search with the query "capital of Denmark", then extract the answer from the results. Since the observation might return the 
top result, I can parse that. But in the previous examples, the code would print the result. So the code would be:                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
web_search("capital of Denmark")                                                                                                                                                 
Then, in the observation, the result would be the capital. Then, the final answer would be that capital.                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Alternatively, if the wiki tool is available, maybe it's more accurate. But since the user didn't specify, I'll go with web_search. Let me write the code accordingly.           
</think>
