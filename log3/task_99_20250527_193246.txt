<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Spain. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have.                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The available tools are web_search and visit_webpage, but the user hasn't provided specific URLs. So maybe I should use the web_search function with the query "capital of       
Spain".                                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the instructions say to use the tools provided. The web_search function returns the top results. So I'll call web_search with the query "capital of Spain". Then, I can    
parse the results to find the capital.                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Once I get the results, I'll check the first entry, which is likely the most relevant. The capital of Spain is Madrid. So I'll extract that from the search results and return   
it.                                                                                                                                                                              
</think>

Okay, so the user asked for the capital of Spain. I used the web_search tool with the query "capital of Spain" and got a bunch of results. The observation shows that the search 
results mention Madrid as the capital. But I need to make sure that Madrid is indeed the correct answer. Let me check the results again.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Looking at the search results, they all confirm that Madrid is the capital of Spain. The first result is from Wikipedia, which clearly states that Madrid is the capital. Other  
sources like Britannica and WorldAtlas also mention Madrid as the capital. The observation also includes multiple links confirming this.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Since all the search results agree that Madrid is the capital, I can confidently say that the answer is Madrid. There's no conflicting information here. The user probably wants 
a straightforward answer, so I'll just return Madrid as the final answer.
