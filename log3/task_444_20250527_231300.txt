<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Sweden. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have.                             
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I can use the web search tool to look up the capital of Sweden. The web_search function can be used here. The query would be "capital of       
Sweden". Let me check if there's any existing data or if I need to process it further.                                                                
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the user might want the most recent information. So I'll perform a web search for the capital of Sweden. The result should give the answer      
directly. Once I get the search results, I can extract the capital from the first result.                                                             
                                                                                                                                                      
Alternatively, if there's a Wikipedia entry, I can use the wiki tool. But since the user didn't specify, web search is more straightforward. Let me   
proceed with the web search.                                                                                                                          
</think>
