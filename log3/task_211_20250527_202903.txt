<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the main ingredient in ceviche. I need to figure out what that is. Ceviche is a type of fresh fish or seafood dish that's usually made with citrus  
fruits like lemon or lime. The citric acid in these fruits helps preserve the fish and gives it a tangy flavor. So the main ingredients are the fish and the citrus juices. But  
maybe the question is looking for the primary component, which is the fish. However, I should verify this.                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I should use the web search tool to check the exact ingredients. Let me perform a search for "main ingredient in ceviche" to confirm. The search results should indicate that the
primary ingredient is the fish, along with the citrus fruits. Once I get the information, I can present it as the answer.

Okay, so the user asked, "What is the main ingredient in ceviche?" Based on the web search results, I need to determine the primary ingredient. The search results mention that  
ceviche typically involves raw fish or shrimp marinated in citrus juices like lime or lemon. The main ingredients are the fish and the citrus acids. However, the search results 
also mention that the secret ingredient in classic ceviche is the acid, which is the citrus juice. But the main ingredient in the sense of the primary component would be the    
fish. However, the answer might need to clarify that the main ingredient is the fish, with the citrus juice being a key component. The search results from the links indicate    
that the fish is the main part, even though the citrus is essential for preservation. So the answer should state that the main ingredient is the fish, with the citrus juices    
being part of the preparation.
