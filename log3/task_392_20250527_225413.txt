Okay, the user is asking who discovered the law of conservation of momentum in classical mechanics. Let me think about how to approach this.          
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I need to recall what I know about this topic. The law of conservation of momentum is a fundamental principle in physics. From what I remember,
it's related to Newton's laws. But I'm not sure about the exact person. I think it's often attributed to Isaac Newton, but I should verify this.      
                                                                                                                                                      
Since the user is asking for a specific person, I need to find a reliable source or a tool that can provide this information. The available tools here
include web search, which I can use to look up the answer. Let me use the web_search function to check.                                               
                                                                                                                                                      
I'll construct a query like "who discovered the law of conservation of momentum" and use the web_search tool. Then, I'll process the results to find  
the correct answer. If the search returns the information, I can extract the name and present it as the final answer.

I read some text about momentum in Wikipedia, but I didn't find any information who discovered momentum. Is the momentum a philosophic principle?

[Laws of conservation of momentum - ScienceQuery](https://sciencequery.com/laws-of-conservation-of-momentum/)
Introduction Sir Isaac Newton discovered the law of conservation of momentum while formulating the laws of motion. The law of conservation of momentum
is a direct consequence of Newton's third law of motion. When two or more bodies act upon one another then in the absence of an external force, the 
total momentum of all bodies in the system in a particular direction remains constant. This is ...

[Conservation of momentum | Definition, Examples, & Facts | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/science/conservation-of-momentum)
Conservation of momentum, general law of physics according to which the quantity called momentum that characterizes motion never changes in an 
isolated collection of objects; that is, the total momentum of a system remains constant. Momentum is equal to the mass of an object multiplied by its
velocity.

What is the definition of momentum in physics? momentum, product of the mass of a particle and its velocity. Momentum is a vector quantity; i.e., it 
has both magnitude and direction. Isaac Newton's second law of motion states that the time rate of change of momentum is equal to the force acting on 
the particle.

The first law, also known as the law of inertia, implies the conservation of momentum. His third law, stating that every action has an equal and 
opposite reaction, provides the foundation for the conservation of momentum during interactions between bodies.
