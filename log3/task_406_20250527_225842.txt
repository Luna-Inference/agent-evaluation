Okay, the user is asking for the chemical symbol of barium. I need to figure out what that is. From what I remember, barium is a metallic element in  
the periodic table. The symbols are usually one or two letters. Let me think... Barium is in group 2, period 6. The symbol is Ba. But wait, maybe I   
should confirm this.                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                      
Since I can use the web search tool, I should check a reliable source. Let me use the web_search function with the query "chemical symbol for barium".
That should give me the correct answer. Once I get the result, I can extract the symbol and provide it as the final answer.
