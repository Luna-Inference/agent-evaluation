<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking who wrote "The Waves". I need to find the author of this novel. Let me think about how to approach this.                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I should check if there's a direct way to find the author. Since The Waves is a well-known poem, maybe I can search for it in a database or a literary resource. The tools
available include web search and maybe a database lookup. The user might expect a straightforward answer, but I need to make sure.                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I remember that The Waves is a poem by T.S. Eliot. But to be thorough, I should verify this. Using the web search tool, I can look up the poem's author. Let me perform a search 
for "The Waves author" to confirm.                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Once I get the result, I can extract the author's name and provide the answer. If the search returns the correct information, I can then use the final_answer tool to present the
result.                                                                                                                                                                          
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web search tool to find the author of "The Waves" and then return the final answer.
