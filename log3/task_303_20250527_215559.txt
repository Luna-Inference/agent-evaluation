<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Papua New Guinea. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have available. The tools include web search,      
visiting webpages, and final answer. Since I can perform web searches, I should use the web_search function.                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I'll use the web_search tool with the query "capital of Papua New Guinea". The expected result should be a string mentioning the capital. Once I get the result, I can    
extract the capital from it and then use the final_answer tool to provide the answer.                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I need to make sure the search is accurate. The capital of Papua New Guinea is Port Moresby. But I should verify via the search tool to ensure there's no outdated information.  
Let's perform the search and then process the result.
