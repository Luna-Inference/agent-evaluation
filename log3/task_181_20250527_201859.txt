Okay, the user is asking for the main ingredient in couscous. I need to figure out how to find this information. Couscous is a staple in North African cuisine, so maybe I can   
search for the ingredients list of couscous.                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I should use the web_search tool to look up the ingredients. The query should be something like "main ingredient in couscous". Let me check the tools available. The      
web_search function takes a query string and returns the top results.                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll run the search and then parse the result to find the main ingredient. The observation will show the search results, and from there, I can extract the answer. If the search 
returns a list of ingredients, the main one would be the first or most prominent item.                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Once I have the answer, I can use the final_answer tool to provide the result. I need to make sure the code is correct and follows the rules, like not using any new variables   
except those defined and using the right arguments for the tools.                                                                                                                
</think>
