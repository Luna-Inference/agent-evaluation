<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking about the main ingredient in cepelinai. First, I need to figure out what "cephelinai" refers to. Cepelinai is a term I'm not 
familiar with. Maybe it's a type of food or a specific dish. Since the user is asking for the main ingredient, I should check if there's a known      
recipe or a common ingredient associated with it.                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                      
I remember that in some contexts, "cephelinai" might be a variation of a dish like "ceviche" or "sashimi," but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it could  
be a regional dish. Since I don't have access to a database, I need to use available tools to search for information.                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
The tools available are web search and visiting webpages. So I should perform a web search to find what "cephelinai" is. The query should be          
straightforward. Let me try searching for "cephelinai main ingredient" to find relevant results.                                                      
                                                                                                                                                      
Once I get the search results, I can analyze the information to determine the main ingredient. If the search returns a list of recipes or food        
articles, I can extract the main ingredients mentioned. If the search isn't direct, maybe I need to look for common ingredients in similar dishes.    
                                                                                                                                                      
Another possibility is that "cephelinai" is a typo or a specific term in a particular cuisine. For example, in some regions, "cephelinai" might refer 
to a specific type of stew or sauce. But without more context, I have to go with the most likely interpretation.                                      
                                                                                                                                                      
So the plan is: perform a web search for "cephelinai main ingredient", analyze the results to find the main ingredient, and then provide the answer.  
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the web search tool to find information about the main ingredient in cepelinai.

Okay, so the user asked about the main ingredient in cepelinai. From the web search results, I need to figure out what's the primary component here.  
Let me look through the links.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                      
The first result mentions that cepelinai are potato dumplings made with grated potatoes and stuffed with ground meat or other ingredients. Another    
source says they're made from grated potatoes and filled with ground pork or beef. There's also a recipe that lists potatoes as the main ingredient,  
along with onions, bacon, and sour cream. Another recipe mentions pork and onion mixture as the fillings.                                             
                                                                                                                                                      
So the main ingredient seems to be potatoes. Even though some recipes include other ingredients like meat or cheese, the primary component is the     
potato. The answer should highlight that potatoes are the main ingredient, even if other elements are added. I need to make sure the final answer     
clearly states that potatoes are the main ingredient in cepelinai.
