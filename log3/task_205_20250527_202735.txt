<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the main ingredient in biryani. I need to figure out what the answer is. Biryani is a type of rice dish, so the main ingredient is probably the     
rice. But maybe there's more to it. Let me think.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I should confirm the main components. Biryani typically consists of long-grain rice, spices, and sometimes meat or vegetables. But the primary ingredient is the rice.    
However, sometimes people might refer to the spices as the main ingredient, but in culinary terms, the rice is the base.                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I need to check if there's a specific answer expected here. Since the user is asking for the main ingredient, the answer is likely the rice. But maybe I should verify using a   
search. Let me use the web_search tool to find the answer.                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So, I'll perform a web search for "main ingredient in biryani" to get the most accurate information. Then I can use the result to form the final answer.
