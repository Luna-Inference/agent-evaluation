<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Bangladesh. Let me think about how to approach this.                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I know that the capital of Bangladesh is Dhaka. But maybe I should verify this using a reliable source. Since the user might expect an accurate answer, I should check a  
reputable database or website.                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I can use the web_search tool to look up the capital of Bangladesh. The query would be something like "capital of Bangladesh". Let me execute that.                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the tools available are web_search and visit_webpage. So I'll use web_search with the query "capital of Bangladesh". The result should give the correct information. Once I
get the result, I can extract the capital from the search results.                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Alternatively, if the web_search returns the answer directly, I can just take that. If not, I might need to parse the HTML content of the search results. But since the user's   
tools don't include parsing functions, I'll assume the web_search returns the answer directly.                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So the code would be:                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
pope_age_wiki = wiki(query="current pope age")                                                                                                                                   
print("Pope age as per wikipedia:", pope_age_wiki)                                                                                                                               
pope_age_search = web_search(query="current pope age")                                                                                                                           
print("Pope age as per google search:", pope_age_search)                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
But for this task, the query is about the capital. So the code should be:                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
capital = web_search(query="capital of Bangladesh")                                                                                                                              
final_answer(capital)                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
But I need to make sure that the web_search returns the correct answer. Since the user's tools are limited, I'll proceed with that.                                              
</think>
