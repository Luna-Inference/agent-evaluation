Okay, the user is asking who discovered the laws of planetary motion. I remember from my science classes that this is a classic question. The laws were discovered by Johannes   
Kepler. But let me make sure.                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I need to confirm the correct answer. Since the user wants the answer, I should use the available tools to search for this information. The tools available are web_search
and wiki. Let me use web_search to get the top results.                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll perform a web search for "laws of planetary motion discoverer" to find the source. Then, I can extract the information from the search results. If the search returns the   
correct information, I can use that to answer the question. If not, maybe I need to check another source. But given the tools I have, this should be sufficient.                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Once I have the answer, I'll present it in the final_answer function.                                                                                                            
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the discoverer of the laws of planetary motion.

[Kepler's laws of planetary motion - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler's_laws_of_planetary_motion)
In astronomy, Kepler's laws of planetary motion, published by Johannes Kepler in 1609 (except the third law, which was fully published in 1619), describe the orbits of planets 
around the Sun. These laws replaced circular orbits and epicycles in the heliocentric theory of Nicolaus Copernicus with elliptical orbits and explained how planetary velocities
vary.

[Kepler's laws of planetary motion - Encyclopedia Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/science/Keplers-laws-of-planetary-motion)

These laws, particularly the third one, provided strong evidence for Newton's law of universal gravitation. How Kepler discovered these laws without the aid of analytic geometry
and di erential calculus, with no notion of momentum, and only a vague conception of gravity, is a fascinating story, perhaps best told by Koestler in [4].

Kepler's Third Law. Kepler's first two laws of planetary motion describe the shape of a planet's orbit and allow us to calculate the speed of its motion at any point in the 
orbit. Kepler was pleased to have discovered such fundamental rules, but they did not satisfy his quest to fully understand planetary motions.
