Okay, the user is asking who wrote "The Republic". I need to find the author of this classic text. Let me think about the tools I have.                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I can use the web search tool to look up the author of "The Republic". The query should be straightforward. Let me check the available tools again. The web_search        
function takes a query string. So I'll call web_search with the query "Who wrote The Republic?".                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the user might expect a direct answer. But since the tools are limited to the provided functions, I have to rely on the search. Let me execute the code to find the answer.
