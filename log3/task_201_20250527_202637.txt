<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Moldova. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have.                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The available tools are web_search and visit_webpage. Maybe a web search would be the best approach here. I can use the web_search function with the query "capital of Moldova". 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, I should check if there's a specific tool for this. The user provided tools include web_search, which returns the top results. So I'll perform a web search for the capital
of Moldova.                                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll write a code snippet that uses web_search with the query "capital of Moldova". Then, I'll parse the results to find the capital. But since the tools don't specify how to   
extract the answer from the search results, I'll assume that the web_search function returns the answer directly.                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Once I get the result, I can print it and then use the final_answer tool to provide the answer. Let me make sure I don't need any other steps. The capital of Moldova is actually
Chisini, but I should confirm via the search.                                                                                                                                    
</think>
