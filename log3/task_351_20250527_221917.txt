<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Uzbekistan. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have.                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Hmm, the available tools are web search, visiting webpages, and final answer. So maybe I should use the web search function to look up the capital of Uzbekistan. The user didn't
specify any particular method, so a straightforward search should work.                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll start by performing a web search with the query "capital of Uzbekistan". Then, I can retrieve the top result and extract the capital from there. Let me check if there's a  
need to visit a specific webpage, but since the question is general, a general search should suffice.                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the tools mention that the web search returns the top results. So I can use the first result to get the capital. Once I have the answer, I can present it using the        
final_answer function.                                                                                                                                                           
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web search tool to find the capital of Uzbekistan.
