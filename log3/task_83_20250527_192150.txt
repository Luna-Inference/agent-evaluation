<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Mexico. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools available. The tools mentioned are web_search, visit_webpage,  
and final_answer. Since the user wants the capital, a web search would be appropriate.                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I should use the web_search function with the query "capital of Mexico". The previous examples show that using web_search with a simple query works. I don't need to visit
a specific webpage because the search tool should return the top result. Then, I can extract the capital from the search results and present it as the answer.                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the user might expect a direct answer. Let me check if the web_search returns the necessary information. If the search results include the capital, I can parse it. But    
since the tools don't specify how to extract the information, I'll assume that the web_search returns the answer directly. So, I'll call web_search with the query and then use  
final_answer to display the result.                                                                                                                                              
</think>
