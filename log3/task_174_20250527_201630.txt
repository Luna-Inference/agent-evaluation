<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Estonia. I need to figure out how to get that information. Let me think about the tools available.                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I remember that in the previous examples, the assistant used web search and wiki tools. Maybe I can use a web search here. The question is straightforward, so a simple   
search should work. The tools allowed are web_search and visit_webpage, but since the user just needs the capital, maybe a direct search would be sufficient.                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the user's question is about a specific fact, so maybe the wiki tool could be used. But the wiki tool's query was about the pope's age, which wasn't relevant here.        
However, the assistant can use the wiki tool to look up the capital of Estonia. Let me check the parameters. The wiki function takes a query string. So I can call wiki with     
"capital of Estonia" as the query.                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Alternatively, using web_search with the query "capital of Estonia" might also work. But since the user is asking for the capital, which is a known fact, maybe the wiki tool is 
more accurate. However, the assistant can't be sure if the wiki tool returns the correct information. But given that the user is expecting a direct answer, perhaps the wiki tool
is the way to go.                                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So the steps would be: use the wiki tool with the query "capital of Estonia" to get the answer. Then return the final answer with that information.                              
</think>

Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Estonia. Earlier attempts tried using the wiki tool but encountered an error because the tool wasn't allowed. Now, I need to find    
another way to get the answer without using the wiki function.                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Since the capital of Estonia is a well-known fact, maybe I can use a web search directly. The previous code used web_search, so I'll try that. Let me check the tools again. The 
allowed tools include web_search, so I can use that.                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll perform a web search for "capital of Estonia" and retrieve the top result. Then, I'll extract the capital from the search results and return it as the final answer.
