<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Belgium. Let me think about how to approach this.                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I know that the capital of Belgium is Brussels. But maybe I should verify this using a reliable source. Since the user might want accurate information, I should use a web
search to confirm. The tools available include web_search, so I'll use that.                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll perform a web search for "capital of Belgium" to get the top results. Then, I can extract the information from the search results. If the search returns the correct answer,
I can present it as the final answer. If not, maybe I need to check again. But given that Brussels is the well-known capital, the search should return that quickly.             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So the steps are: use web_search with the query, get the result, and then final_answer with the found capital.                                                                   
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the capital of Belgium.
