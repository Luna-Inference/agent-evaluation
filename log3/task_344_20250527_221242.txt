<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking who discovered the law of conservation of mechanical energy. Let me think about how to approach this.                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I need to recall the history of physics. The law of conservation of mechanical energy is a fundamental principle in physics. I remember that this law was developed by    
several scientists, but I'm not sure about the exact individuals.                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, I think it's related to the work of James Prescott Joule and other scientists. Joule is known for the law of conservation of energy, but I'm not certain about the specific
part about mechanical energy.                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Alternatively, I might need to look up the historical context. Since the user wants the answer, maybe I should use a search tool to find the source. The tools available include 
web search, so I can use the web_search function to find the answer.                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Let me check the available functions. The web_search function takes a query string. The query should be something like "who discovered the law of conservation of mechanical     
energy".                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I should also consider if there are any other factors. For example, maybe the law was developed by multiple scientists, but the question is asking for the discoverer.           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I need to make sure the search is accurate. The previous examples show that using web_search with the correct query can retrieve the answer. So, I'll use the web_search tool    
with the query "who discovered the law of conservation of mechanical energy" and then present the result.                                                                        
</think>

[James Prescott Joule | Biography & Facts | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/biography/James-Prescott-Joule)
James Prescott Joule, English physicist who established that the various forms of energy, such as electrical and heat, are basically the same and can be changed one into 
another. Thus, he formed the basis of conservation of energy, the first law of thermodynamics. Learn more about Joule's life and work.

[James Prescott Joule - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Prescott_Joule)
Joule studied the nature of heat and discovered its relationship to mechanical work. This led to the law of conservation of energy, which in turn led to the development of the 
first law of thermodynamics. The SI unit of energy, the joule (J), is named after him.

[Who Discovered the Law of Conservation of Energy? (Description)](https://thepowerfacts.com/who-discovered-the-law-of-conservation-of-energy/)
The law of conservation of energy can be applied to any system—whether it is mechanical, electrical, nuclear, or even biological. In each case, the total amount of energy in the
system remains constant over time.

[James Prescott Joule - Famous People in the World](https://www.thefamouspeople.com/profiles/james-prescott-joule-4856.php)
He studied the nature of heat, and discovered its relationship to mechanical work. This led to the law of conservation of energy, which led to the development of the first law 
of thermodynamics.

[James Prescott Joule - Biography, Facts and Pictures](https://www.famousscientists.org/james-prescott-joule/)
James Prescott Joule studied the nature of heat and established its relationship to mechanical work. He laid the foundation for the theory of conservation of energy, which later
influenced the First Law of Thermodynamics. He also formulated the Joule's law which deals with the transfer of energy.

[Joule and the Conservation of Energy - galileo.phys.virginia.edu](https://galileo.phys.virginia.edu/classes/152.mf1i.spring02/Joule.htm)
His experiments establishing the equivalence of heat and mechanical work, the cornerstone of the principle of conservation of energy, are among the greatest achievements of 
nineteenth-century science. But was Carnot so wrong?

[The Discovery of the Law of Conservation of Energy - JSTOR](https://www.jstor.org/stable/224595)
This article explores the discovery and development of the Law of Conservation of Energy, a fundamental principle in physics.

[James Prescott Joule | Biography, Discoveries & Facts - Study.com](https://study.com/learn/lesson/james-prescott-joule-biography-discoveries-facts.html)
James Prescott Joule was an English scientist and mathematician. He discovered the relationship between heat and mechanical energy, which led to the all-important law of 
conservation of energy.

[June 1849: James Prescott Joule and the Mechanical Equivalent of Heat](https://www.aps.org/apsnews/2015/06/joule-mechanical-equivalent-heat)
Combined with the results of other researchers, Joule's determination of the mechanical equivalent of heat led to the First Law of Thermodynamics. The law, based on the idea of 
the conservation of energy, states that for a process in a defined system, the change in internal energy is equal to the amount of heat absorbed minus the work done.
