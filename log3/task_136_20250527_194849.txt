<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the chemical symbol of lead. I need to figure out what that is. From what I remember, lead is a metal, and its symbol is Pb. But maybe I should     
verify this using a reliable source.                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the tools available include web search and wiki. So perhaps I can use the web_search function to look up the chemical symbol for lead. Let me check the tools again. The   
web_search function takes a query string and returns the top results. The query should be something like "chemical symbol for lead".                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Alternatively, maybe the wiki tool can provide this information. The wiki query would be "chemical symbol lead". But since the user is asking for a direct answer, maybe the web 
search is more straightforward.                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I should perform a web search for "chemical symbol for lead" to get the correct answer. Once I get the results, I can extract the symbol from the top result. Then, use the      
final_answer function to return the symbol.                                                                                                                                      
</think>
