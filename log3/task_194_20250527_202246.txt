Okay, the user is asking who discovered the law of electromagnetism. Let me think about how to approach this.                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I need to recall which scientists are associated with the law of electromagnetism. The law of electromagnetism is typically referred to as Coulomb's Law, which was       
discovered by Charles-Augustin de Coulomb. However, I should verify this to be sure.                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, but sometimes the law of electromagnetism is also associated with Michael Faraday and James Clerk Maxwell. Faraday's work on electromagnetism led to the discovery of      
electromagnetic induction, and Maxwell later formulated the equations that unified electricity and magnetism. However, the specific law might be Coulomb's Law, which is about   
the force between two point charges.                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I need to check the sources to confirm. Since I can use the web search tool, I should perform a search to find the correct answer. Let me use the web_search function with the   
query "who discovered the law of electromagnetism".                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Once I get the results, I can extract the information and provide the answer. The answer should be the name of the scientist, likely Coulomb, but I need to make sure.
