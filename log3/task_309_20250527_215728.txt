<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Fiji. Let me think about how to approach this.                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I know that the capital of Fiji is Suva. But maybe I should verify this using a reliable source. Since the user might want the most accurate information, I should use a  
web search to confirm.                                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I can use the web_search tool to look up the capital of Fiji. The query would be something like "capital of Fiji". The tool will return the top results, and I can check the     
first result to confirm the answer.                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Once I have the information, I can directly answer the question using the final_answer tool.                                                                                     
</think>
