<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user wants me to define 'photosynthesis'. I need to figure out how to approach this. Since I'm supposed to use the tools provided, let me   
check what tools I have.                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
The available tools are web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer. The web_search function can be used to look up information. So I should use      
web_search with the query "what is photosynthesis".                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                      
I'll call web_search with the query to get the top results. Then, I can parse the results to extract the definition. But wait, the tools don't have a 
specific function to parse web results. So I'll just use the web_search result directly.                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Once I get the result, I can use the final_answer tool to present the definition. Let me make sure the query is correct. The user might expect a      
concise definition, so the search should return the necessary information.                                                                            
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the definition of photosynthesis and then provide the final answer.
