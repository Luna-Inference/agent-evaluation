<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking who invented the World Wide Web. I need to figure out how to find this information. Let me think about the tools I have.     
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I can use the web search tool to look up the invention of the World Wide Web. The web_search function can be used with a query like "who       
invented the World Wide Web". The result from the search should give me the answer.                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                      
I should also consider if there are any other sources, but since the user hasn't specified any particular method, sticking with a direct web search   
seems straightforward. Let me check the tools again. The web_search function takes a query string and returns the top results.                        
                                                                                                                                                      
So the plan is to call web_search with the query "who invented the World Wide Web" and then retrieve the result. The answer will be the first result  
from the search. I need to make sure the code is correctly formatted and uses the right parameters.                                                   
                                                                                                                                                      
I'll write the code to perform the search and then output the result. If the search returns the correct information, I can present it as the final    
answer. If not, maybe I need to refine the query, but for now, this should work.                                                                      
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the web search tool to find the answer to the question "Who invented the World Wide Web?".                                        
Code:                                                                                                                                                 
```py

final_answer(web_search(query="who invented the World Wide Web"))                                                                                     
```
