<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking about the process of cell division. I need to figure out what the correct term is. From what I remember, cell division has two main types: mitosis and  
meiosis. Mitosis is for growing and repairing cells, while meiosis is for producing gametes like eggs and sperm. But the question is general, so maybe they just want the common 
term.                                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the question is "What is the process of cell division called?" So the answer is typically "cell division" itself, but maybe they want the specific terms like mitosis or   
meiosis. But the process is called cell division, which encompasses both mitosis and meiosis. However, sometimes the answer expects the specific terms. Let me check.            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
In biology, cell division is the process by which a cell divides into two daughter cells. The two main types are mitosis (for growth and repair) and meiosis (for reproduction). 
But the question is general, so the answer might be "cell division" itself. However, sometimes the answer expects the specific terms. But since the question is phrased as "the  
process," the answer is "cell division." But maybe the user wants the two types. Wait, the user didn't specify, so the safest answer is "cell division," which includes both     
mitosis and meiosis. But I need to confirm.                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Alternatively, maybe the answer is "mitosis" and "meiosis" as the two processes. But the question is about the process, not the types. So the answer is "cell division." However,
sometimes the answer expects the specific terms. But since the question is general, I should answer with the general term. So the final answer is "cell division."

Okay, the user is asking about the process of cell division. Earlier, I tried using the `wiki` tool but got an error because the tool wasn't allowed. Now I need to figure out   
another way to answer this without using external tools.                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I remember that cell division is a general term, but the two main types are mitosis and meiosis. Since the question is about the process itself, the answer is "cell division."  
However, maybe the user wants the specific terms. But the question is general, so the answer should be the general term. I should confirm this by recalling biology knowledge.   
Cell division refers to the process where a cell splits into two, encompassing both mitosis and meiosis. So the answer is "cell division." I'll proceed to provide this as the   
final answer.

Thought: The process of cell division is generally referred to as "cell division" itself, which includes both mitosis (for growth and repair) and meiosis (for reproduction).    
Since the question is about the process rather than the specific types, the answer is "cell division."
