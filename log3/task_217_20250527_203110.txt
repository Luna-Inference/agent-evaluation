<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the main ingredient in lasagna. I need to figure out what the answer is. Let me think. Lasagna is a pasta dish, typically made with pasta, cheese,  
and sauce. The main ingredients are usually the pasta, cheese, and a tomato-based sauce. But maybe the question is more specific. I should check if there's a standard answer.   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the user might be looking for the primary components. The main ingredients are typically the pasta, the sauce, and the cheese. But sometimes people mention the specific   
ingredients like wheat (for the pasta), tomatoes, garlic, olive oil, and cheese like mozzarella. However, the main ingredient could be considered the pasta because it's the     
base. But I need to confirm.                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Since I can use web search here, I should perform a search to find the standard answer. Let me use the web_search tool with the query "main ingredient in lasagna". The result   
should give me the answer. Once I get the information, I can then present it as the final answer.
