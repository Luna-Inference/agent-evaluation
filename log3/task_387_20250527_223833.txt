<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Albania. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have.                            
                                                                                                                                                      
The available tools are web_search and visit_webpage. Maybe a web search would be the best approach here. I can use the web_search function with the  
query "capital of Albania". Let me check if there's a specific website or source that provides this information.                                      
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the user might expect a direct answer. But since I can't browse the web directly, I need to use the web_search tool. Let me execute the search. 
The result should give the capital name. Once I get the result, I can extract the capital from the search results.                                    
                                                                                                                                                      
I'll write a code snippet to perform the web search and then parse the result to find the capital. If the search returns the capital directly, I can  
just return that. If not, maybe I need to look for the specific information. But given that the question is straightforward, the search should return 
the answer.                                                                                                                                           
</think>
