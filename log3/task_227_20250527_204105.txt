<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking who wrote "The Metamorphosis". I need to find the author of this famous novel. Let me think about the tools I have.                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I can use the web search tool to look up the book. The query should be "The Metamorphosis author". Let me check the search results. The top result might mention the      
author. Alternatively, I can use the wiki tool if it has information on the book. But since the user might want the most accurate answer, starting with a web search makes sense.
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll write a code snippet to perform a web search with the query "The Metamorphosis author". Then, I'll parse the result to extract the author's name. If the search returns the 
correct information, I can confirm it and provide the final answer. If not, I might need to adjust the search terms. But given that The Metamorphosis is a well-known work, the  
search should be straightforward.                                                                                                                                                
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web search tool to find the author of "The Metamorphosis".
