Okay, the user is asking for the main ingredient in pho. I need to figure out what that is. Pho is a Vietnamese noodle soup, right? The main ingredients are usually noodle,     
broth, and vegetables. But maybe they want the primary component, like the noodles.                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the question is about the main ingredient. So, the noodles are the main part. But maybe they want to know the primary component, which could be the broth or the           
vegetables. But traditionally, the noodles are the main ingredient. Let me check if there's a specific answer expected here.                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Since I can use the web search tool, I should search for "main ingredient in pho" to confirm. Let me do that.

Thought: I will use the web search tool to find the main ingredient in pho.

Okay, so the user asked, "What is the main ingredient in pho?" Based on the web search results, I need to determine the primary component. From the observations, the search     
results mention that pho typically includes rice noodles, beef, fish sauce, and vegetables like onions and ginger. However, the main ingredient is often considered the noodles  
because they form the base of the soup. The answer should clarify that the main ingredient is the rice noodles, even though other components like beef and fish sauce are        
important. I'll summarize this in the final answer.
