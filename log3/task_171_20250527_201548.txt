Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Latvia. Let me think about how to approach this.                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I know that the capital of Latvia is Riga. But maybe I should verify this using a reliable source. Since the user might want an accurate answer, I should use the web     
search tool to confirm.                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So, I'll use the web_search function with the query "capital of Latvia". The tool will return the top results. Then I can extract the capital from the results.                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the tools available are web_search and visit_webpage. The web_search function returns the top results as a string. I need to parse that string to find the capital.        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Once I get the result, I can directly answer the question. Let me write the code to perform the search and then process the output.                                              
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the capital of Latvia and then extract the answer from the results.
