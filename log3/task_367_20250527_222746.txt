<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking about the main ingredient in dolma. I need to figure out what dolma is. Dolma is a traditional Georgian dish, right? From    
what I remember, it's a type of vegetable salad. But I should verify this.                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I should check if there's a reliable source or a way to look up the ingredients. Since I can use web search, I can perform a search to find out
the ingredients of dolma. Let me use the web_search tool with the query "dolma ingredients".                                                          
                                                                                                                                                      
Once I get the results, I can parse them to find the main ingredient. The answer will be the primary component mentioned in the search results. If the
search returns multiple sources, I need to confirm the common ingredient. If the results are unclear, maybe the main ingredient is a specific         
vegetable like potatoes, cabbage, or tomatoes. But I should make sure to use the actual search results to get the accurate information.               
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the web search tool to find the ingredients of dolma and determine its main component.

<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, so the user asked what the main ingredient in dolma is. From the web search results, I need to figure out the answer. Let me look through the   
search results again.                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
The first result mentions that dolma is made with grape leaves, brine, and rice. Another source says it's stuffed with rice mixed with onions, lemon  
juice, salt, and pepper. There's also a mention of using lean ground beef and aubergine. But the main ingredient seems to be the rice mixture.        
However, the question is about the main ingredient, so I need to check which is the primary component.                                                
                                                                                                                                                      
Looking at the recipes, the filling often includes rice, onions, herbs, and meat. But the question is about the main ingredient. Since the recipe     
mentions "rice" as a key component, and the leaves are the wrapper, the main ingredient would be the rice mixture inside the leaves. But sometimes    
it's just the rice. Wait, the search results also mention "grape leaves" as the wrapper, but the filling is the rice with other ingredients. So the   
main ingredient is the rice, but the leaves are the wrapper. However, the question is about the main ingredient in dolma, which is the filling. So the
answer is rice. But I need to confirm. The search results show that the filling is rice mixed with other stuff. So the main ingredient is rice. But   
sometimes it's just the rice. Hmm. The answer should be rice, but maybe the user wants the main ingredient in the filling. So the main ingredient is  
rice. But I need to check the search results again. The first result says "grape leaves in brine (about 60 to 70 leaves), I used Oralndo brand        
(affiliate link)" which suggests the main ingredient is the grape leaves, but the filling is the brine and rice. Wait, the user might be asking for   
the main ingredient in the filling. So the answer is rice. But the search results also mention "arborio rice" in one of the recipes. So the main      
ingredient is rice. Therefore, the answer is rice.

Thought: The main ingredient in dolma is the rice mixture used in the filling. The search results confirm that dolma is made with grape leaves wrapped
around a rice filling containing onions, lemon juice, salt, and herbs. The primary component of the filling is rice.
