Okay, the user is asking who wrote "The Great Gatsby." Let me think about how to approach this.                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I need to find the author of the book. Since I can use web search tools, I should perform a search to find the author. The tools available include web_search and         
visit_webpage. Maybe a simple web search would suffice here.                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll use the web_search function with the query "Who wrote The Great Gatsby?" The result should give me the author's name. Once I get that, I can present it as the final answer.
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I need to make sure the search is accurate. If the search returns the correct information, I can confirm the author. If not, maybe try a different query, but for now, let's     
proceed with the initial search.                                                                                                                                                 
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web search tool to find the author of "The Great Gatsby."
