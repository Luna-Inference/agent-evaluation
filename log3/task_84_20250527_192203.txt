Okay, the user is asking for the main ingredient in sushi. Let me think about how to approach this.                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I need to recall what sushi is made of. Sushi is typically made with rice, usually fermented rice, and then filled with various ingredients. The main ingredient is       
usually the rice. But maybe there are different variations. For example, in some cases, the rice might be mixed with vegetables, fish, or other components. However, the most    
common main ingredient is the rice itself.                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
But since the user is asking for the main ingredient, I should verify this. The best way to find this information is by using a web search to confirm the standard answer. So    
I'll use the web_search tool with the query "main ingredient in sushi".                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Once I get the result, I can extract the answer. If the search returns that the main ingredient is rice, then that's the answer. If there's more context, like different types of
sushi, I need to mention that. But generally, rice is the main component.                                                                                                        
</think>

Okay, so the user asked, "What is the main ingredient in sushi?" Based on the web search results, I need to figure out the answer. The search results mention that sushi         
typically includes rice, nori, fish, and vegetables. But the question is about the main ingredient.                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
From the observations, the search results indicate that the main ingredient is rice. However, there's also mention of nori and fish as important components. But the question is 
specifically about the main ingredient. In traditional sushi, rice is the primary component, even though other ingredients like nori and fish are added. So the answer should be 
rice. The other ingredients are supplementary. Therefore, the main ingredient is rice.

Thought: The main ingredient in sushi is typically the rice. Although nori and fish are important, rice is the foundational component. The web search results confirm this.
