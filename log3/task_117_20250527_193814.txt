Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Portugal. I need to find that out. Let me think about the tools available. The tools mentioned are web_search, visit_webpage, and    
final_answer. Since the question is straightforward, maybe a web search would work.                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I should use the web_search function with the query "capital of Portugal". The previous examples show that using web_search with a query returns the top results. So I'll 
call web_search with that query.                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Once I get the results, I need to parse them to find the capital. But according to the rules, I can't use any additional tools or variables beyond what's defined. The           
observation will be the output of the web_search, which I can then process.                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the user's task is to provide the answer, so after getting the search results, I can extract the capital from the first result. For example, if the search returns         
something like "The capital of Portugal is Lisbon.", then the answer is Lisbon.                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
But how to handle this in code? Let me structure the code. Use web_search with the query, then check the output to find the capital. Then use final_answer to return it.         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So the code would be:                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
web_search("capital of Portugal")                                                                                                                                                
then parse the result to find the capital, then call final_answer.                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
But since the output of web_search is a string, I need to check if it contains the capital. For example, if the result is "The capital of Portugal is Lisbon.", then the answer  
is Lisbon.                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Therefore, the code would be:                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
result = web_search("capital of Portugal")                                                                                                                                       
capital = result.split("is")[1].split(" ")[0]                                                                                                                                    
final_answer(capital)                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
But I need to make sure that the split is correct. Alternatively, maybe the result is more straightforward. If the first result is directly stating the capital, then the code   
can take that directly.                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So the code would be:                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
code:                                                                                                                                                                            
```py                                                                                                                                                                            
result = web_search("capital of Portugal")                                                                                                                                       
final_answer(result)                                                                                                                                                             
```                                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
But wait, the user might expect a more precise answer. However, given the tools available, this is the best approach. The web_search returns the top result, which is likely to  
be the capital. So the answer is the first part of the result string.                                                                                                            
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the capital of Portugal and then return the result.

result = web_search("capital of Portugal")
