<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of France. I need to figure out how to get that information. Let me think about the tools available.         
                                                                                                                                                      
The tools mentioned are web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer. Since the user is asking for a factual answer, web_search might be the best      
option. I can use the web_search function with the query "capital of France" to get the top results. Then, I can extract the capital from the search  
results.                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the previous examples show that when searching, the results are returned as strings. So I'll perform the search, check the first result, and    
parse it to find the capital. For instance, if the search returns something like "The capital of France is Paris.", I can take that as the answer.    
                                                                                                                                                      
I should make sure not to use any other tools unnecessarily. Since the question is straightforward, using web_search should suffice. Let me write the 
code to do that.                                                                                                                                      
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the capital of France and then return the answer.
