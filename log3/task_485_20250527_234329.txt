<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking for the deepest point in the ocean. I need to figure out how to get this information. Let me think about the tools I have.   
The available tools are web_search and visit_webpage, which can be used to look up information.                                                       
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I should use the web_search function with the query "deepest point in the ocean" to find the relevant information. The result might provide the
answer directly. Once I get the search results, I can parse them to find the deepest point, which is Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench.           
                                                                                                                                                      
I should make sure to check the sources to confirm the accuracy. If the search returns multiple results, I need to pick the one that states the       
deepest point. Then, use the final_answer function to present the answer.                                                                             
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the deepest point in the ocean and then extract the answer from the results.
