 Thought: To derive the wave equation from Maxwell's equations in vacuum, I will first need to write down Maxwell's equations and then manipulate them
to isolate a second derivative of electric or magnetic field variables with respect to space and time.

vacuum and then rewrite Maxwell's equations in terms of electric and magnetic fields only. After that, by manipulating these equations, I will be able to find a second-order
