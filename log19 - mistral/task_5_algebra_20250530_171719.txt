variable in each equation using substitution or elimination method, then solve for the other variable.

   1) Isolate y in the first equation.                                                                                                                
   2) Substitute y in the second equation to get an expression for x in terms of a single variable (either y or x).                                   
   3) Solve the resulting equation for x using numpy's linalg.solve function.

              Thought: To solve the given system of linear equations using Python and numpy, I will proceed step by step as follows:
1) Isolate y in the first equation.
2) Substitute y in the second equation to get an expression for x in terms of a single variable (either y or x).
3) Solve the resulting equation for x using numpy's linalg.solve function.
4) Calculate y with the found value of x.
5) Return the solution as final answer using the `final_answer` tool.

Code:
```py
# Isolate y in the first equation
y = (12 - 3*x) / 2

# Substitute y in the second equation and get an expression for x
substituted_equation = "x - " + str(y) + " == 1"

# Convert the string expression to coefficients matrix A and vector B
coefficients, constant = parse_equation(substituted_equation)

# Solve for x using numpy's linalg.solve function
A = np.array([[coefficients[0\], coefficients[1\]], [1, 0\]])
B = np.array([constant, 0\])
x_solved = np.linalg.solve(A, B)[0\]

# Calculate y with the found value of x

              Thought: To solve the given system of linear equations using numpy and parse_equation tools, I will proceed step by step as follows:
1) Isolate y in the first equation.
2) Substitute y in the second equation to get an expression for x.
3) Convert the string expression to coefficients matrix A and vector B using parse_equation tool.
4) Solve for x using numpy's linalg.solve function.
5) Calculate y with the found value of x.
6) Return the solution as final answer using the `final_answer` tool.

Code:
```py
# Isolate y in the first equation
y = (12 - 3*x) / 2

# Substitute y in the second equation and get an expression for x
substituted_equation = "x - " + str(y) + " == 1"

# Convert the string expression to coefficients matrix A and vector B using parse_equation tool
coefficients, constant = parse_equation(substituted_equation)

# Solve for x using numpy's linalg.solve function
A = np.array([[coefficients[0\], coefficients[1\]], [1, 0\]])
B = np.array([constant, 0\])
x_solved = np.linalg.solve(A, B)[0\]

# Calculate y with the found value of x
y_solved = (12 - 3*x_solved) / 2
