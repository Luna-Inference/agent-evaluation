 Thought: To find out the percentage of values in a normal distribution that fall within a specific range, I will use the cumulative distribution     
function (CDF) for the normal distribution. Then, I'll calculate the required probabilities on both sides of the range and subtract them to get the

 Thought: Given a normal distribution with μ = 100 and σ = 15, I want to find the percentage of values that fall within the range [85, 130]. To do    
this, I will define a function called `cdf_normal()` for calculating cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a normal distribution given mean and   
standard deviation. Then, I'll use this function to find probabilities on both sides of the range [85, 130]. After that, I will subtract these values 
and multiply the result by 100 to get the percentage.
