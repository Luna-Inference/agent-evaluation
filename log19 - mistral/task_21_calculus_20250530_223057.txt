Output:
 To find the volume of the solid formed by rotating the area under the curve y = ln(x) around the x-axis from x = 1 to x = e, we will use Python's built-in function `quad` from the math module. First, let's define our function f(x) = ln(x). Then we set up our bounds for integration: x_from = 1 and x_to = e (Euler's number).
   Code:
   ```py
   from math import log, pi

   def f(x):
       return log(x)

   x_from = 1
   x_to = math.exp(1) # e is Euler's number, which is an approximation of e^1
   _, y_to = quad(f, x_from, x_to)
   volume = 2 * pi * (y_to - y_from)
   ```<end_code>

Task 21 complete.
