 Thought: To prove this statement, I will use Python to check if the sum of two even numbers returns an even number. To achieve this, I can create a  
loop to iterate over a range of even numbers and check if their sum remains even or not.

 Thought: To prove that the sum of two even numbers is always even, I can create a Python loop to iterate over a range of even numbers and check if   
their sum remains even or not.

 Thought: The user has provided the code to iterate through all possible pairs of even numbers and check if their sum is even. To prove that the sum  
of two even numbers is always even, I will verify that there are no counterexamples in this list. If the loop completes without finding any           
counterexample, it means that the statement is correct.

 Thought: To prove that the sum of two even numbers is always even, I can create a Python loop to iterate over pairs of even numbers and check if     
their sum remains even or not. If no counterexample is found during this iteration, it means that the statement is correct.

 Thought: To prove that the sum of two even numbers is always even, we can iterate through all possible pairs of even numbers less than a certain     
limit (e.g., 100) and check if their sum is even or not. If no counterexample is found during this iteration, it means that the statement is correct.

 Thought: To generate two random even numbers between 1 and 100, I can use Python's built-in `random` module to generate a pair of odd numbers first, 
and then subtract 1 from the second number to make it even.
