 Thought: To calculate the definite integral of a function, I will use numerical integration using Simpson's rule. The formula for Simpson's rule is  
given as follows:                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                      
∫_a^b f(x) dx ≈ (b-a)/6 * [f(a) + 4*Σ[f(xi)] + f(b)]                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                      
where xi are the points of division, equidistant from each other. I will divide the interval [0, π/2] into 100 equal parts.

             It seems like you're trying to return the final answer, you can do it as follows:

             ```py
             final_answer("YOUR FINAL ANSWER HERE")
             ```<end_code>

             It seems like you're trying to return the final answer, you can do it as follows:
             Code:
             ```py
             final_answer("YOUR FINAL ANSWER HERE")
             ```<end_code>
Make sure to provide correct code blobs.

             It seems like you're trying to return the final answer, you can do it as follows:
             Code:
             ```py
             final_answer("YOUR FINAL ANSWER HERE")
             ```<end_code>
Make sure to provide correct code blobs.

 Thought: To solve this task, I need to compute an approximate value of the definite integral of sin(x)cos(x) from 0 to π/2 using numerical

             It seems like you're trying to return the final answer, you can do it as follows:
             Code:
             ```py
             final_answer("YOUR FINAL ANSWER HERE")
             ```<end_code>
Make sure to provide correct code blobs.

              Thought: To solve this task, I need to compute an approximate value of the definite integral of sin(x)cos(x) from 0 to π/2 using 
numerical integration via Simpson's rule with given accuracy and error tolerance. The provided tool 'simpsons_rule' will be used along with proper 
variable initialization and a check for error. I will use a loop to keep trying different values of n_parts until the error tolerance is reached or 
maximum retries are exceeded. To do this, I don't need any additional tools beyond those provided: simpsons_rule, sin_cos, final_answer.
Code:
```py
def simpsons_rule(f, a, b, n):
    h = (b-a)/n
    sum = f(a) + 4*Σ[f(xi)\] + f(b)
    return (h/3)*sum

def sin_cos(x):
    return math.sin(x)*math.cos(x)

lower_limit, upper_limit, n_parts = 0, math.pi/2, 100  # initializing variables
error_tolerance = 0.00001  # setting error tolerance as a float
n_retries = 3  # number of retries allowed before trying another approach
final_answer = None

for i in range(n_retries):
    if math.fabs(simpsons_rule(sin_cos, lower_limit, upper_limit, n_parts) - simpsons_rule(sin_cos, lower_limit, upper_limit, n_parts + 1)) <= 
error_tolerance:
        final_answer = simpsons_rule(sin_cos, lower_limit, upper_limit, n_parts)
        break
    else:
        n_parts += 1

if final_answer is None:
    print("Failed to find answer with allowed retries and error tolerance.")
else:
    final_answer(final_answer)
```<end_code>
             It seems like you're trying to return the final answer, you can do it as follows:
             Code:
             ```py
             final_answer("YOUR FINAL ANSWER HERE")
             ```<end_code>

   After running the code, the output will be the approximate value of the definite integral of sin(x)cos(x) from 0 to π/2 using Simpson's rule.
