Okay, the user wants a summary of Einstein's theory of relativity in one sentence. Let me think about how to approach this.
                                                                                                                           
First, I need to recall the key points of the theory. The theory of relativity has two parts: special relativity and       
general relativity. Special relativity deals with objects moving at constant speeds, especially near the speed of light,   
and introduces concepts like time dilation and length contraction. General relativity extends this by incorporating        
gravity, describing it as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy.                                            
                                                                                                                           
So, combining these, the theory of relativity explains that the laws of physics are the same for all non-accelerating      
observers and that the speed of light is constant, leading to the conclusion that space and time are interconnected. But I 
need to phrase this concisely in one sentence.                                                                             
                                                                                                                           
I should mention both special and general relativity, the key principles, and the main consequence. Maybe something like:  
"The theory of relativity posits that the laws of physics are invariant in all inertial frames of reference and that the   
speed of light in a vacuum is constant, leading to the conclusion that space and time are interwoven into a single         
continuum called spacetime."                                                                                               
                                                                                                                           
Wait, but the user wants it in one sentence. Let me check if that's accurate. Yes, that covers both aspects and the main   
idea. I should make sure the sentence is clear and correct.                                                                
</think>                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                           
Thought: I will use the `wiki` tool to retrieve the theory of relativity and then summarize it in one sentence.            
Code:

that the speed of light in a vacuum is constant, leading to the conclusion that space and time are interwoven into a single

Okay, the user asked to summarize Einstein's theory of relativity in one sentence. The previous attempt tried using the    
`wiki` tool, but the system reported that the tool isn't allowed. So I need to find another way to get the information     
without using external tools.                                                                                              
                                                                                                                           
Since the allowed tools are limited to the ones mentioned in the problem statement, which include `web_search`,            
`visit_webpage`, `final_answer`, and others, I should use `web_search` to look up the theory of relativity. Let me         
structure the code to perform a web search for the theory and then summarize the result.                                   
                                                                                                                           
I'll need to call `web_search` with the query "theory of relativity" to get the relevant information. Then, I'll extract   
the key points from the search results and formulate a concise summary. Finally, I'll use `final_answer` to present the    
summary.
