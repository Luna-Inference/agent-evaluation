Okay, I need to list the first 5 prime numbers. Let's think about how to approach this.                                    
                                                                                                                           
Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. The first few primes are 2, 3, 
5, 7, 11, and so on. So the first five should be 2, 3, 5, 7, 11.                                                           
                                                                                                                           
But how to generate this using Python code? Well, I can start by checking each number sequentially. Let's see, the first   
prime is 2. Then 3, then 5, 7, 11. So maybe I can write a loop that checks each number starting from 2 upwards, and        
collects the primes until I have five of them.                                                                             
                                                                                                                           
Wait, but how to implement this. Let's think. For each number starting at 2, check if it's prime. How to check if a number 
is prime? Well, a prime number is a number greater than 1 that is only divisible by 1 and itself. So for a number n, if any
number from 2 to sqrt(n) divides it, then it's not prime. Otherwise, it is.                                                
                                                                                                                           
So the steps would be:                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                           
1. Start with a list to hold the primes.                                                                                   
2. Iterate from 2 upwards.                                                                                                 
3. For each number, check if it's prime.                                                                                   
4. If it is, add it to the list.                                                                                           
5. Once the list has 5 elements, stop.                                                                                     
                                                                                                                           
But how to implement the prime check. Let's write a helper function. For example, a function is_prime(n) that returns True 
if n is prime.                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                           
So, code steps:                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                           
- Create a list.                                                                                                           
- Loop n from 2 upwards.                                                                                                   
- For each n, check if it's prime.                                                                                         
- If yes, add to list.                                                                                                     
- Stop when list has 5 elements.                                                                                           
                                                                                                                           
But how to handle the loop. Let's code this.                                                                               
                                                                                                                           
Wait, but maybe there's a more efficient way. However, for the first five primes, checking each number up to 11 is         
straightforward.                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                           
So, let's code:                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                           
Initialize a list, primes = []                                                                                             
n = 2                                                                                                                      
while len(primes) < 5:                                                                                                     
    if is_prime(n):                                                                                                        
        primes.append(n)                                                                                                   
    n += 1                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                           
Then, return primes.                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                           
But I need to implement is_prime. Let's write that.                                                                        
                                                                                                                           
So, the code would be:                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                           
def is_prime(n):                                                                                                           
    if n < 2:                                                                                                              
        return False                                                                                                       
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5)+1):                                                                                      
        if n % i == 0:                                                                                                     
            return False                                                                                                   
    return True                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                           
primes = []                                                                                                                
n = 2                                                                                                                      
while len(primes) < 5:                                                                                                     
    if is_prime(n):                                                                                                        
        primes.append(n)                                                                                                   
    n += 1                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                           
Then, print the primes.                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                           
But in the code, I need to make sure that the helper function is defined. However, in the code blocks, I can define        
functions. So the code would be:                                                                                           
                                                                                                                           
But the user might not have the helper function defined. Wait, but in the code, I can define the is_prime function as part 
of the code.                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                           
So, the code would be:                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                           
First, define the is_prime function, then generate the primes.                                                             
                                                                                                                           
But the user's task is to list the first 5 primes. So the code would generate that list.                                   
                                                                                                                           
So the code steps:                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                           
1. Define is_prime.                                                                                                        
2. Initialize primes list.                                                                                                 
3. Loop n from 2 upwards, checking each.                                                                                   
4. Stop when 5 primes are found.                                                                                           
5. Output the list.                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                           
So the code would be:                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                           
def is_prime(n):                                                                                                           
    if n < 2:                                                                                                              
        return False                                                                                                       
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):                                                                                    
        if n % i == 0:                                                                                                     
            return False                                                                                                   
    return True                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                           
primes = []                                                                                                                
n = 2                                                                                                                      
while len(primes) < 5:                                                                                                     
    if is_prime(n):                                                                                                        
        primes.append(n)                                                                                                   
    n += 1                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                           
print(primes)                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                           
But the user might not have the helper function. However, in the code, the helper function is defined. So this should work.
                                                                                                                           
Alternatively, maybe there's a way to generate the first 5 primes without a helper function. But for the first five, it's  
manageable.                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                           
So the code would generate the list [2, 3, 5, 7, 11], which are the first five primes.                                     
                                                                                                                           
Therefore, the final answer is the list of these numbers.

Thought: I will generate the first 5 prime numbers by checking each number sequentially and verifying if it's prime. I'll  
use a helper function to check primality and collect the primes until I have five elements.
