Okay, the user is asking for the capital of France. I need to find that out. Let me think about the tools available. The   
tools mentioned include web search, visiting web pages, and final answer. So maybe I should use the web_search function to 
look up the capital of France.                                                                                             
                                                                                                                           
First, I'll use the web_search tool with the query "capital of France". The results should give me the answer. Once I get  
the result, I can extract the capital from the search results. Then, I can use the final_answer tool to present the answer.
