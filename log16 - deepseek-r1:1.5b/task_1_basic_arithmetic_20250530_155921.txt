Okay, let's tackle this problem: "What is 15 + 27?" I need to figure out how to approach this.                                                        
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I should recall what addition means. It's the process of combining two numbers to find their total. So, I have 15 and 27 here. Adding them     
together will give me the sum.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                      
I think the best way is to add the tens place first and then the ones place. Let's break it down:                                                     
                                                                                                                                                      
15 can be written as 10 + 5, and 27 can be written as 20 + 7.                                                                                         
So adding the tens: 10 + 20 = 30.                                                                                                                     
Adding the ones: 5 + 7 = 12.                                                                                                                          
Now, I have to combine these two results. But wait, the ones place sum is 12, which is a two-digit number. That means I need to carry over the extra  
ten.                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                      
So adding the tens and ones places together:                                                                                                          
30 (from the tens) plus 12 (from the ones), but since 12 has an extra ten, it's like having 30 + 10 = 40 in the tens place, and then 2 left over. So  
that gives me 42.                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait a second, did I do that right? Let me double-check:                                                                                              
15 is 10 and 5.                                                                                                                                       
27 is 20 and 7.                                                                                                                                       
Adding the tens: 10 + 20 = 30.                                                                                                                        
Adding the ones: 5 + 7 = 12.                                                                                                                          
Now, since 12 is more than 10, I take away 10 (the carry over) and add it to the tens place. So now I have:                                           
30 + 10 = 40 in the tens place, and then there's 2 left from the ones place. That gives me a total of 42.                                             
                                                                                                                                                      
I think that makes sense because if you imagine combining 15 and 27 on a number line, starting at 15 and moving up by 27 units lands you at 42.

To find the sum of 15 and 27:                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                      
1. Break down each number into tens and ones:                                                                                                         
   - 15 = 10 + 5                                                                                                                                      
   - 27 = 20 + 7                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                      
2. Add the tens: 10 + 20 = 30                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                      
3. Add the ones: 5 + 7 = 12                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                      
4. Since there's a carry-over from the ones place, add an extra ten to the tens sum:                                                                  
   - 30 (tens) + 10 = 40                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
5. The remaining ones digit is 2.                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                      
6. Combine everything: 40 + 2 = 42                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                      
Final Answer: 42

Okay, let's tackle this problem: "What is 15 + 27?" I need to figure out how to approach this. 

First, I should recall what addition means. It's the process of combining two numbers to find their total. So, I have 15 and 27 here. Adding them 
together will give me the sum.

I think the best way is to add the tens place first and then the ones place. Let's break it down:

15 can be written as 10 + 5, and 27 can be written as 20 + 7.
So adding the tens: 10 + 20 = 30.
Adding the ones: 5 + 7 = 12.
Now, I have to combine these two results. But wait, the ones place sum is 12, which is a two-digit number. That means I need to carry over the extra 
ten.

So adding the tens and ones places together:
30 (from the tens) plus 12 (from the ones), but since 12 has an extra ten, it's like having 30 + 10 = 40 in the tens place, and then 2 left over. So 
that gives me 42.

Wait a second, did I do that right? Let me double-check:
15 is 10 and 5.
27 is 20 and 7.
Adding the tens: 10 + 20 = 30.
Adding the ones: 5 + 7 = 12.
Now, since 12 is more than 10, I take away 10 (the carry over) and add it to the tens place. So now I have:
30 + 10 = 40 in the tens place, and then there's 2 left from the ones place. That gives me a total of 42.

I think that makes sense because if you imagine combining 15 and 27 on a number line, starting at 15 and moving up by 27 units lands you at 42.
</think>

To find the sum of 15 and 27:

1. Break down each number into tens and ones:
   - 15 = 10 + 5
   - 27 = 20 + 7

2. Add the tens: 10 + 20 = 30

3. Add the ones: 5 + 7 = 12

4. Since there's a carry-over from the ones place, add an extra ten to the tens sum:
   - 30 (tens) + 10 = 40

5. The remaining ones digit is 2.

6. Combine everything: 40 + 2 = 42

Final Answer: 42

I'll break them down into tens and ones:                   
                                                                                                                                                      
- 15 can be written as 10 + 5                                                                                                                         
- 27 can be written as 20 + 7                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                      
Now, I'll add the tens place first: 10 + 20 = 30.                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                      
Next, I'll add the ones place: 5 + 7 = 12.                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                      
Since there's a carry-over from the ones place, I'll take an extra ten and add it to the tens sum: 30 + 10 = 40. Then, the remaining ones digit is 2. 
                                                                                                                                                      
Combining everything gives me 40 + 2 = 42.                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                      
So, 15 + 27 equals 42.                                                                                                                                
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
To find the sum of 15 and 27:                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                      
1. Break down each number into tens and ones:                                                                                                         
   - 15 = 10 + 5                                                                                                                                      
   - 27 = 20 + 7                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                      
2. Add the tens: 10 + 20 = 30                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                      
3. Add the ones: 5 + 7 = 12                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                      
4. Since there's a carry-over from the ones place, add an extra ten to the tens sum:                                                                  
   - 30 (tens) + 10 = 40                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
5. The remaining ones digit is 2.                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                      
6. Combine everything: 40 + 2 = 42

Okay, I need to solve the task: "What is 15 + 27?" Let me think step by step.

First, I remember that addition involves combining two numbers. So, I have 15 and 27 here. I'll break them down into tens and ones:

- 15 can be written as 10 + 5
- 27 can be written as 20 + 7

Now, I'll add the tens place first: 10 + 20 = 30.

Next, I'll add the ones place: 5 + 7 = 12.

Since there's a carry-over from the ones place, I'll take an extra ten and add it to the tens sum: 30 + 10 = 40. Then, the remaining ones digit is 2.

Combining everything gives me 40 + 2 = 42.

So, 15 + 27 equals 42.

Alright, I need to solve the task: "What is 15 + 27?" Let me break it down step by step.                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I understand that addition involves combining two numbers. So, I have 15 and 27 here. To make it easier, I'll break each number into its tens  
and ones components.                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                      
- 15 can be written as 10 + 5                                                                                                                         
- 27 can be written as 20 + 7                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                      
Now, I'll add the tens place first: 10 + 20 = 30. This means that together, the tens digits sum up to 30.                                             
                                                                                                                                                      
Next, I'll add the ones place: 5 + 7 = 12. Here, the ones digits add up to 12. Since this is more than a single digit, I know there's a carry-over    
from this addition.                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                      
Taking that carry-over into account, I'll add an extra ten to the tens sum. So, 30 (tens) + 10 = 40. This means that combining both the tens and ones 
digits appropriately gives me 40.                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                      
Finally, I have the remaining ones digit from the ones place addition: 2. Combining this with the previous result, I get 40 + 2 = 42.                 
                                                                                                                                                      
So, when I add 15 and 27 together, the result is 42.

Alright, I need to solve the task: "What is 15 + 27?" Let me break it down step by step.

First, I understand that addition involves combining two numbers. So, I have 15 and 27 here. To make it easier, I'll break each number into its tens 
and ones components.

- 15 can be written as 10 + 5
- 27 can be written as 20 + 7

Now, I'll add the tens place first: 10 + 20 = 30. This means that together, the tens digits sum up to 30.

Next, I'll add the ones place: 5 + 7 = 12. Here, the ones digits add up to 12. Since this is more than a single digit, I know there's a carry-over 
from this addition.

Taking that carry-over into account, I'll add an extra ten to the tens sum. So, 30 (tens) + 10 = 40. This means that combining both the tens and ones 
digits appropriately gives me 40.

Finally, I have the remaining ones digit from the ones place addition: 2. Combining this with the previous result, I get 40 + 2 = 42.

So, when I add 15 and 27 together, the result is 42.

To find the sum of 15 and 27:

1. Break down each number into tens and ones:
   - 15 = 10 + 5
   - 27 = 20 + 7

2. Add the tens: 10 + 20 = 30

3. Add the ones: 5 + 7 = 12

4. Since there's a carry-over from the ones place, add an extra ten to the tens sum:
   - 30 (tens) + 10 = 40

5. The remaining ones digit is 2.

6. Combine everything: 40 + 2 = 42

Final Answer: 42

- 15 can be written as 10 + 5                                                                                                                         
- 27 can be written as 20 + 7                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                      
Now, I'll add the tens place first: 10 + 20 = 30. This means that together, the tens digits sum up to 30.                                             
                                                                                                                                                      
Next, I'll add the ones place: 5 + 7 = 12. Here, the ones digits add up to 12. Since this is more than a single digit, I know there's a carry-over    
from this addition.                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                      
Taking that carry-over into account, I'll add an extra ten to the tens sum. So, 30 (tens) + 10 = 40. This means that combining both the tens and ones 
digits appropriately gives me 40.                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                      
Finally, I have the remaining ones digit from the ones place addition: 2. Combining this with the previous result, I get 40 + 2 = 42.                 
                                                                                                                                                      
So, when I add 15 and 27 together, the result is 42.

Okay, I need to solve the task: "What is 15 + 27?" Let me break it down step by step.

First, I understand that addition involves combining two numbers. So, I have 15 and 27 here. To make it easier, I'll break each number into its tens 
and ones components.

- 15 can be written as 10 + 5
- 27 can be written as 20 + 7

Now, I'll add the tens place first: 10 + 20 = 30. This means that together, the tens digits sum up to 30.

Next, I'll add the ones place: 5 + 7 = 12. Here, the ones digits add up to 12. Since this is more than a single digit, I know there's a carry-over 
from this addition.

Taking that carry-over into account, I'll add an extra ten to the tens sum. So, 30 (tens) + 10 = 40. This means that combining both the tens and ones 
digits appropriately gives me 40.

Finally, I have the remaining ones digit from the ones place addition: 2. Combining this with the previous result, I get 40 + 2 = 42.

So, when I add 15 and 27 together, the result is 42.
</think>

To find the sum of 15 and 27:

1. Break down each number into tens and ones:
   - 15 = 10 + 5
   - 27 = 20 + 7

2. Add the tens: 10 + 20 = 30

3. Add the ones: 5 + 7 = 12

4. Since there's a carry-over from the ones place, add an extra ten to the tens sum:
   - 30 (tens) + 10 = 40

5. The remaining ones digit is 2.

6. Combine everything: 40 + 2 = 42

Final Answer: 42

Alright, I need to solve the task: "What is 15 + 27?" Let me break it down step by step.

First, I understand that addition involves combining two numbers. So, I have 15 and 27 here. To make it easier, I'll break each number into its tens 
and ones components.

- 15 can be written as 10 + 5
- 27 can be written as 20 + 7

Now, I'll add the tens place first: 10 + 20 = 30. This means that together, the tens digits sum up to 30.

Next, I'll add the ones place: 5 + 7 = 12. Here, the ones digits add up to 12. Since this is more than a single digit, I know there's a carry-over 
from this addition.

Taking that carry-over into account, I'll add an extra ten to the tens sum. So, 30 (tens) + 10 = 40. This means that combining both the tens and ones 
digits appropriately gives me 40.

Finally, I have the remaining ones digit from the ones place addition: 2. Combining this with the previous result, I get 40 + 2 = 42.

So, when I add 15 and 27 together, the result is 42.

To find the sum of 15 and 27:

1. Break down each number into tens and ones:
   - 15 = 10 + 5
   - 27 = 20 + 7

2. Add the tens place first: 10 + 20 = 30

3. Add the ones place next: 5 + 7 = 12

4. Since there's a carry-over from the ones place, add an extra ten to the tens sum: 30 (tens) + 10 = 40

5. The remaining ones digit is 2.

6. Combine everything: 40 + 2 = 42

Alright, I need to solve the task: "What is 15 + 27?" Let me break it down step by step.

First, I understand that addition involves combining two numbers. So, I have 15 and 27 here. To make it easier, I'll break each number into its tens 
and ones components.

- 15 can be written as 10 + 5
- 27 can be written as 20 + 7

Now, I'll add the tens place first: 10 + 20 = 30. This means that together, the tens digits sum up to 30.

Next, I'll add the ones place: 5 + 7 = 12. Here, the ones digits add up to 12. Since this is more than a single digit, I know there's a carry-over 
from this addition.

Taking that carry-over into account, I'll add an extra ten to the tens sum. So, 30 (tens) + 10 = 40. This means that combining both the tens and ones 
digits appropriately gives me 40.

Finally, I have the remaining ones digit from the ones place addition: 2. Combining this with the previous result, I get 40 + 2 = 42.

So, when I add 15 and 27 together, the result is 42.
</think>

To find the sum of 15 and 27:

1. Break down each number into tens and ones:
   - 15 = 10 + 5
   - 27 = 20 + 7

2. Add the tens place first: 10 + 20 = 30

3. Add the ones place next: 5 + 7 = 12

4. Since there's a carry-over from the ones place, add an extra ten to the tens sum: 30 (tens) + 10 = 40

5. The remaining ones digit is 2.

6. Combine everything: 40 + 2 = 42

Final Answer: 42

Alright, I need to solve the task: "What is 15 + 27?" Let me break it down step by step.

First, I understand that addition involves combining two numbers. So, I have 15 and 27 here. To make it easier, I'll break each number into its tens 
and ones components.

- 15 can be written as 10 + 5
- 27 can be written as 20 + 7

Now, I'll add the tens place first: 10 + 20 = 30. This means that together, the tens digits sum up to 30.

Next, I'll add the ones place: 5 + 7 = 12. Here, the ones digits add up to 12. Since this is more than a single digit, there's a carry-over from this 
addition.

Taking that carry-over into account, I'll add an extra ten to the tens sum. So, 30 (tens) + 10 = 40. This means that combining both the tens and ones 
digits appropriately gives me 40.

Finally, I have the remaining ones digit from the ones place addition: 2. Combining this with the previous result, I get 40 + 2 = 42.

So, when I add 15 and 27 together, the result is 42.

To find the sum of 15 and 27:

1. Break down each number into tens and ones:
   - 15 = 10 + 5
   - 27 = 20 + 7

2. Add the tens place first: 10 + 20 = 30

3. Add the ones place next: 5 + 7 = 12

4. Since there's a carry-over from the ones place, add an extra ten to the tens sum: 30 (tens) + 10 = 40

5. The remaining ones digit is 2.

6. Combine everything: 40 + 2 = 42

Alright, I need to solve the task: "What is 15 + 27?" Let me break it down step by step.                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I understand that addition involves combining two numbers. So, I have 15 and 27 here. To make it easier, I'll break each number into its tens  
and ones components.                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                      
- 15 can be written as 10 + 5                                                                                                                         
- 27 can be written as 20 + 7                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                      
Now, I'll add the tens place first: 10 + 20 = 30. This means that together, the tens digits sum up to 30.                                             
                                                                                                                                                      
Next, I'll add the ones place: 5 + 7 = 12. Here, the ones digits add up to 12. Since this is more than a single digit, there's a carry-over from this 
addition.                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                      
Taking that carry-over into account, I'll add an extra ten to the tens sum. So, 30 (tens) + 10 = 40. This means that combining both the tens and ones 
digits appropriately gives me 40.                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                      
Finally, I have the remaining ones digit from the ones place addition: 2. Combining this with the previous result, I get 40 + 2 = 42.                 
                                                                                                                                                      
So, when I add 15 and 27 together, the result is 42.                                                                                                  
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
To find the sum of 15 and 27:                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                      
1. Break down each number into tens and ones:                                                                                                         
   - 15 = 10 + 5                                                                                                                                      
   - 27 = 20 + 7                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                      
2. Add the tens place first: 10 + 20 = 30                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                      
3. Add the ones place next: 5 + 7 = 12                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                      
4. Since there's a carry-over from the ones place, add an extra ten to the tens sum: 30 (tens) + 10 = 40                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
5. The remaining ones digit is 2.                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                      
6. Combine everything: 40 + 2 = 42                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                      
Final Answer: 42

Alright, I need to solve the task: "What is 15 + 27?" Let me break it down step by step.

First, I understand that addition involves combining two numbers. So, I have 15 and 27 here. To make it easier, I'll break each number into its tens 
and ones components.

- 15 can be written as 10 + 5
- 27 can be written as 20 + 7

Now, I'll add the tens place first: 10 + 20 = 30. This means that together, the tens digits sum up to 30.

Next, I'll add the ones place: 5 + 7 = 12. Here, the ones digits add up to 12. Since this is more than a single digit, there's a carry-over from this 
addition.

Taking that carry-over into account, I'll add an extra ten to the tens sum. So, 30 (tens) + 10 = 40. This means that combining both the tens and ones 
digits appropriately gives me 40.

Finally, I have the remaining ones digit from the ones place addition: 2. Combining this with the previous result, I get 40 + 2 = 42.

So, when I add 15 and 27 together, the result is 42.

To find the sum of 15 and 27:

1. Break down each number into tens and ones:
   - 15 = 10 + 5
   - 27 = 20 + 7

2. Add the tens place first: 10 + 20 = 30

3. Add the ones place next: 5 + 7 = 12

4. Since there's a carry-over from the ones place, add an extra ten to the tens sum: 30 (tens) + 10 = 40

5. The remaining ones digit is 2.

6. Combine everything: 40 + 2 = 42

Final Answer: 42

- 27 can be written as 20 + 7                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                      
Now, I'll add the tens place first: 10 + 20 = 30. This means that together, the tens digits sum up to 30.                                             
                                                                                                                                                      
Next, I'll add the ones place: 5 + 7 = 12. Here, the ones digits add up to 12. Since this is more than a single digit, there's a carry-over from this 
addition.                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                      
Taking that carry-over into account, I'll add an extra ten to the tens sum. So, 30 (tens) + 10 = 40. This means that combining both the tens and ones 
digits appropriately gives me 40.                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                      
Finally, I have the remaining ones digit from the ones place addition: 2. Combining this with the previous result, I get 40 + 2 = 42.                 
                                                                                                                                                      
So, when I add 15 and 27 together, the result is 42.

   - 15 = 10 + 5                                                                                                                                      
   - 27 = 20 + 7                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                      
2. Add the tens place first: 10 + 20 = 30

Alright, I need to solve the task: "What is 15 + 27?" Let me break it down step by step.

First, I understand that addition involves combining two numbers. So, I have 15 and 27 here. To make it easier, I'll break each number into its tens 
and ones components.

- 15 can be written as 10 + 5
- 27 can be written as 20 + 7

Now, I'll add the tens place first: 10 + 20 = 30. This means that together, the tens digits sum up to 30.

Next, I'll add the ones place: 5 + 7 = 12. Here, the ones digits add up to 12. Since this is more than a single digit, there's a carry-over from this 
addition.

Taking that carry-over into account, I'll add an extra ten to the tens sum. So, 30 (tens) + 10 = 40. This means that combining both the tens and ones 
digits appropriately gives me 40.

Finally, I have the remaining ones digit from the ones place addition: 2. Combining this with the previous result, I get 40 + 2 = 42.

So, when I add 15 and 27 together, the result is 42.

   - 27 = 20 + 7

2. Add the tens place first: 10 + 20 = 30

3. Add the ones place next: 5 + 7 = 12

4. Since there's a carry-over from the ones place, add an extra ten to the tens sum: 30 (tens) + 10 = 40

Now, I'll add the tens place first: 10 + 20 = 30. This means that together, the tens digits sum up to 30.

addition.                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                      
Taking that carry-over into account, I'll add an extra ten to the tens sum. So, 30 (tens) + 10 = 40. This means that combining both the tens and ones 
digits appropriately gives me 40.                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                      
Finally, I have the remaining ones digit from the ones place addition: 2. Combining this with the previous result, I get 40 + 2 = 42.                 
                                                                                                                                                      
So, when I add 15 and 27 together, the result is 42.

To find the sum of 15 and 27:                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                      
1. Break down each number into tens and ones:                                                                                                         
   - 15 = 10 + 5                                                                                                                                      
   - 27 = 20 + 7                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                      
2. Add the tens place first: 10 + 20 = 30                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                      
3. Add the ones place next: 5 + 7 = 12                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                      
4. Since there's a carry-over from the ones place, add an extra ten to the tens sum: 30 (tens) + 10 = 40                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
5. The remaining ones digit is 2.                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                      
6. Combine everything: 40 + 2 = 42

Alright, I need to solve the task: "What is 15 + 27?" Let me break it down step by step.

First, I understand that addition involves combining two numbers. So, I have 15 and 27 here. To make it easier, I'll break each number into its tens 
and ones components.

- 15 can be written as 10 + 5
- 27 can be written as 20 + 7

Now, I'll add the tens place first: 10 + 20 = 30. This means that together, the tens digits sum up to 30.

Next, I'll add the ones place: 5 + 7 = 12. Here, the ones digits add up to 12. Since this is more than a single digit, there's a carry-over from this 
addition.

Taking that carry-over into account, I'll add an extra ten to the tens sum. So, 30 (tens) + 10 = 40. This means that combining both the tens and ones 
digits appropriately gives me 40.

Finally, I have the remaining ones digit from the ones place addition: 2. Combining this with the previous result, I get 40 + 2 = 42.

So, when I add 15 and 27 together, the result is 42.

- 15 can be written as 10 + 5                                                                                                                         
- 27 can be written as 20 + 7                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                      
Now, I'll add the tens place first: 10 + 20 = 30. This means that together, the tens digits sum up to 30.                                             
                                                                                                                                                      
Next, I'll add the ones place: 5 + 7 = 12. Here, the ones digits add up to 12. Since this is more than a single digit, there's a carry-over from this 
addition.                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                      
Taking that carry-over into account, I'll add an extra ten to the tens sum. So, 30 (tens) + 10 = 40. This means that combining both the tens and ones 
digits appropriately gives me 40.                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                      
Finally, I have the remaining ones digit from the ones place addition: 2. Combining this with the previous result, I get 40 + 2 = 42.                 
                                                                                                                                                      
So, when I add 15 and 27 together, the result is 42.

1. Break down each number into tens and ones:                                                                                                         
   - 15 = 10 + 5                                                                                                                                      
   - 27 = 20 + 7                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                      
2. Add the tens place first: 10 + 20 = 30                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                      
3. Add the ones place next: 5 + 7 = 12                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                      
4. Since there's a carry-over from the ones place, add an extra ten to the tens sum: 30 (tens) + 10 = 40

6. Combine everything: 40 + 2 = 42

Alright, I need to solve the task: "What is 15 + 27?" Let me break it down step by step.

First, I understand that addition involves combining two numbers. So, I have 15 and 27 here. To make it easier, I'll break each number into its tens 
and ones components.

- 15 can be written as 10 + 5
- 27 can be written as 20 + 7

Now, I'll add the tens place first: 10 + 20 = 30. This means that together, the tens digits sum up to 30.

Next, I'll add the ones place: 5 + 7 = 12. Here, the ones digits add up to 12. Since this is more than a single digit, there's a carry-over from this 
addition.

Taking that carry-over into account, I'll add an extra ten to the tens sum. So, 30 (tens) + 10 = 40. This means that combining both the tens and ones 
digits appropriately gives me 40.

Finally, I have the remaining ones digit from the ones place addition: 2. Combining this with the previous result, I get 40 + 2 = 42.

So, when I add 15 and 27 together, the result is 42.

- 15 can be written as 10 + 5

Now, I'll add the tens place first: 10 + 20 = 30. This means that together, the tens digits sum up to 30.                                             
                                                                                                                                                      
Next, I'll add the ones place: 5 + 7 = 12. Here, the ones digits add up to 12. Since this is more than a single digit, there's a carry-over from this 
addition.                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                      
Taking that carry-over into account, I'll add an extra ten to the tens sum. So, 30 (tens) + 10 = 40. This means that combining both the tens and ones 
digits appropriately gives me 40.                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                      
Finally, I have the remaining ones digit from the ones place addition: 2. Combining this with the previous result, I get 40 + 2 = 42.

   - 27 = 20 + 7                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                      
2. Add the tens place first: 10 + 20 = 30                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                      
3. Add the ones place next: 5 + 7 = 12                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                      
4. Since there's a carry-over from the ones place, add an extra ten to the tens sum: 30 (tens) + 10 = 40                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
5. The remaining ones digit is 2.                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                      
6. Combine everything: 40 + 2 = 42                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                      
Final Answer: 42

Alright, I need to solve the task: "What is 15 + 27?" Let me break it down step by step.

First, I understand that addition involves combining two numbers. So, I have 15 and 27 here. To make it easier, I'll break each number into its tens 
and ones components.

- 15 can be written as 10 + 5
- 27 can be written as 20 + 7

Now, I'll add the tens place first: 10 + 20 = 30. This means that together, the tens digits sum up to 30.

Next, I'll add the ones place: 5 + 7 = 12. Here, the ones digits add up to 12. Since this is more than a single digit, there's a carry-over from this 
addition.

Taking that carry-over into account, I'll add an extra ten to the tens sum. So, 30 (tens) + 10 = 40. This means that combining both the tens and ones 
digits appropriately gives me 40.

Finally, I have the remaining ones digit from the ones place addition: 2. Combining this with the previous result, I get 40 + 2 = 42.

So, when I add 15 and 27 together, the result is 42.

Now, I'll add the tens place first: 10 + 20 = 30. This means that together, the tens digits sum up to 30.

Since there's a carry-over from the ones place, add an extra ten to the tens sum: 30 (tens) + 10 = 40                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
5. The remaining ones digit is 2.                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                      
6. Combine everything: 40 + 2 = 42

            <think>

Alright, I need to solve the task: "What is 15 + 27?" Let me break it down step by step.

First, I understand that addition involves combining two numbers. So, I have 15 and 27 here. To make it easier, I'll break each number into its tens 
and ones components.

- 15 can be written as 10 + 5
- 27 can be written as 20 + 7

Now, I'll add the tens place first: 10 + 20 = 30. This means that together, the tens digits sum up to 30.

Next, I'll add the ones place: 5 + 7 = 12. Here, the ones digits add up to 12. Since this is more than a single digit, there's a carry-over from this 
addition.

Taking that carry-over into account, I'll add an extra ten to the tens sum. So, 30 (tens) + 10 = 40. This means that combining both the tens and ones 
digits appropriately gives me 40.

Finally, I have the remaining ones digit from the ones place addition: 2. Combining this with the previous result, I get 40 + 2 = 42.

So, when I add 15 and 27 together, the result is 42.
</think>

To find the sum of 15 and 27:

1. Break down each number into tens and ones:
   - 15 = 10 + 5
   - 27 = 20 + 7

2. Add the tens place first: 10 + 20 = 30

3. Add the ones place next: 5 + 7 = 12

4. Since there's a carry-over from the ones place, add an extra ten to the tens sum: 30 (tens) + 10 = 40

5. The remaining ones digit is 2.

6. Combine everything: 40 + 2 = 42

Final Answer: 42
