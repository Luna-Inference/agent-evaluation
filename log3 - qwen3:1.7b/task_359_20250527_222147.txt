<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking who wrote the book "Orlando." Let me think about how to approach this.                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I need to find the author of "Orlando." I know that "Orlando" is a novel by Aldous Huxley. But maybe the user wants to confirm this or check if there's any other author? 
Wait, the task is straightforward: determine the author of "Orlando."                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Since I can use web search tools, I should perform a search to find the author. The tools available are web_search and visit_webpage. Let me use web_search with the query "Who  
wrote Orlando?".                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll write a code snippet that uses the web_search function with the appropriate parameters. Then, based on the result, I can provide the answer. If the search returns the      
correct information, I can confirm that Aldous Huxley is the author. If there's any uncertainty, I might need to check further, but given that this is a standard question, the  
answer should be clear.                                                                                                                                                          
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web search tool to find the author of "Orlando."
