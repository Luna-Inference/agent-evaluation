<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking for the main ingredient in fondue. I need to figure out what fondue is. Fondue is a type of French cuisine, usually involving
melting cheese. But maybe there are different variations. The user might be looking for the most common ingredient, which is typically cheese.        
However, I should verify this.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I should check if there's a tool to search for recipes or ingredients. The available tools are web_search and visit_webpage. Let me use        
web_search with the query "main ingredient in fondue". That should give me the top results. Then, based on the search results, determine the main     
ingredient. If the search returns something like "cheese" as the main ingredient, that's the answer. If there's more context, like a specific type of 
fondue, I need to consider that. But since the question is general, the answer is likely cheese. Let me proceed with the code.                        
</think>
