Okay, the user is asking who wrote "Middlemarch". I need to figure out the answer. Let me think.                                                      
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I remember that "Middlemarch" is a novel by George Eliot. But maybe I should verify this. Since the task is to find the author, I should use   
the available tools to confirm.                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                      
Looking at the tools provided, there's a wiki tool and a web search tool. The wiki tool can be used to look up the author of the book. Let me try that
first.                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                      
So, I'll use the wiki function with the query "Middlemarch author". The expected result should be George Eliot. Then, I can confirm and provide the   
answer.                                                                                                                                               
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the wiki tool to find the author of "Middlemarch".

Okay, the previous attempt tried to use the wiki tool but got an error because the tool wasn't allowed. The user's system restricts using external    
tools like wiki. So I need to find another way to answer the question without relying on external functions.                                          
                                                                                                                                                      
Since I can't use the wiki tool, I'll have to rely on my knowledge. I know that "Middlemarch" is indeed written by George Eliot. But to be thorough,  
maybe I can check the author's name through a web search. However, the web_search tool might not be accessible either. Alternatively, I can use the   
built-in knowledge base.                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the user's tools include a web search function. Let me try using that. Even though the previous attempt failed, maybe I can structure the code  
differently. Let me try again with the web_search tool to confirm the author's name.                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                      
So, the code would be: perform a web search for "Middlemarch author" and extract the result. Then, output the answer.
