<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking who discovered radioactivity. I need to find the answer using the tools available. Let me think about the steps.                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I should use the web search tool to look up the history of radioactivity. The query should be something like "who discovered radioactivity". Then, I can retrieve the     
results and extract the information.                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the tools provided include web_search and visit_webpage. So I can call web_search with the query. The result will be the top results. I need to check the first result to  
find the name.                                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Once I get the answer, I can use the final_answer tool to present it. Let me make sure the code is correct. The code should be straightforward: call web_search with the right   
query and then print the result.                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I should also check if there are any other tools needed, but based on the examples, the web_search is sufficient. So the code will be something like:                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
web_search("who discovered radioactivity")                                                                                                                                       
final_answer(result)                                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
But I need to make sure the result is captured properly. The observation will show the first result, which should be the answer. Then, the final answer is the name of the       
discoverer.                                                                                                                                                                      
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the answer to the question "Who discovered radioactivity" and then return the final answer.                                      
Code:
