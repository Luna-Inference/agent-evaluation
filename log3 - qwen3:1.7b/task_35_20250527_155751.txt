Okay, the user is asking for a mammal that can fly. Let me think about this. I know that there are birds that can fly, but the question specifies     
mammals. So I need to recall which mammals have wings or can fly.                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                      
I remember that bats are mammals and they can fly. Bats use both wings and echolocation. So maybe the answer is bats. But I should verify this. Let me
check if there's any other mammal that can fly. For example, flying squirrels? Wait, flying squirrels are squirrels, not mammals, but they have wings.
But the question asks for a mammal, so flying squirrels might be considered here. However, I think the primary example is bats.                       
                                                                                                                                                      
I should use the web search tool to confirm. Let me perform a search for "mammal that can fly" to get accurate information. The search results will   
tell me the correct answer.

Thought: I need to find a mammal that can fly. I will use the web search tool to look up this information.

[Which Mammals Can Fly? - A-Z Animals](https://a-z-animals.com/articles/which-mammals-can-fly/)
Some mammals such as sugar gliders and flying squirrels are capable of gliding from place to place, thanks to a membrane called a patagium. The 
patagium is attached to their limbs and serves as a sort of parachute. Gliding can be gravitational or soaring. Mammals that glide do so 
gravitationally, which means they launch themselves at their target, and then let the wind help them get there.
