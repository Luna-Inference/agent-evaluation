<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking who wrote "The Catcher in the Rye." Let me think about how to approach this.                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I need to find the author of the book. The book is a well-known novel, so maybe I can use a search tool to look up the author. The tools available include web search and 
visiting webpages. The user might want the most accurate answer, so a web search would be appropriate.                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I should use the web_search function with the query "Who wrote The Catcher in the Rye?" Let me check if there's any need for additional steps. Since the question is             
straightforward, a single search should suffice. I don't need to visit specific pages unless the search returns multiple results, but the tool's documentation says it returns   
the top results.                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the user's task is to answer the question, so the code should perform the search and then output the answer. Let me structure the code: call web_search with the query,    
then print the result. The final answer will be the result from the search.                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I need to make sure the code is correct. The function calls are correct, and the variables are properly used. No unnecessary steps. Let me write the code now.                   
</think>
