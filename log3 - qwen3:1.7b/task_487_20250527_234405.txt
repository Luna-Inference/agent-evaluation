<think>                                                                                                                                                      
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Chile. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have.                                     
                                                                                                                                                             
The available tools are web_search and visit_webpage. Maybe I can use web_search with the query "capital of Chile". Let me check if that's sufficient.       
Alternatively, I can use the wiki tool, but since the user didn't mention any specific wiki, maybe web_search is better here.                                
                                                                                                                                                             
I'll proceed by performing a web search for the capital of Chile. The code would be something like:                                                          
                                                                                                                                                             
pope_age_wiki = wiki(query="current pope age")                                                                                                               
print("Pope age as per wikipedia:", pope_age_wiki)                                                                                                           
pope_age_search = web_search(query="current pope age")                                                                                                       
print("Pope age as per google search:", pope_age_search)                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                             
Wait, but the user's question is about the capital of Chile, not the pope. Oh, I see, the previous example was about the pope, but this task is different. So
I need to adjust the query.                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                             
So the correct query should be "capital of Chile". Let me write the code for that. The code would be:                                                        
                                                                                                                                                             
capital = web_search(query="capital of Chile")                                                                                                               
final_answer(capital)                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                             
But I need to make sure that the web_search returns the correct information. If the search returns the capital, then that's the answer. If not, maybe I need 
to visit the webpage and extract the information. But according to the tools, I can use web_search directly.                                                 
                                                                                                                                                             
So the code would be:                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                             
capital = web_search("capital of Chile")                                                                                                                     
final_answer(capital)                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                             
I should check if the web_search returns the correct result. If it does, then the answer is there. If not, maybe I need to visit the webpage, but the tools  
don't have a visit_webpage function with a specific parameter for the query. Wait, the user's tools include visit_webpage, but the code would need to use    
that. However, in the previous example, the user used web_search and it worked. So perhaps the web_search tool is sufficient here.                           
                                                                                                                                                             
Therefore, the code is as above. Let me write that.                                                                                                          
</think>                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                             
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the capital of Chile.
