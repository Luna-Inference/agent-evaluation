<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking who wrote "The Odyssey". I need to figure out how to find this information. Let me think about the tools available.          
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I can use the web search tool to look up the answer. The query should be straightforward. Let me check the tools again. The web_search function
takes a query string. So I'll call web_search with "The Odyssey author".                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, maybe there's a more precise way. Sometimes, knowing that "The Odyssey" is an ancient Greek poem might help, but the tool should handle it. Let 
me just use the direct search.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                      
I'll write a code snippet that uses web_search with the query "The Odyssey author". Then, the result should give me the author. Once I get the answer,
I can present it as the final answer.                                                                                                                 
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the author of "The Odyssey".
