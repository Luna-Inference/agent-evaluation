<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Estonia. I need to figure out how to get that information. Let me think about the tools I have available. 
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I remember that in the previous examples, the assistant used tools like web_search and visit_webpage to get information from the web. So maybe 
I should use a web search here. The question is straightforward, so a simple web search should work.                                                  
                                                                                                                                                      
The tools available are web_search, which takes a query string, and visit_webpage, which reads the content of a webpage. But since the user is asking 
for a factual answer, maybe the web_search tool can directly provide the answer. Let me check the rules again. The assistant can use the tools as if  
they are regular Python functions. So I can call web_search with the query "capital of Estonia" and get the top results.                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Alternatively, maybe the assistant can use the wiki tool, but the previous examples didn't use wiki for this question. The user's task is to find the 
capital, which is a factual question. So using web_search makes sense here.                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                      
I should structure the code to perform a web search for the capital of Estonia. The code would be something like:                                     
                                                                                                                                                      
web_search(query="capital of Estonia")                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                      
Then, the observation would return the top result. Once the result is obtained, the assistant can extract the capital from the search results and     
return it as the final answer.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the assistant's code needs to be in Python. So the code would be:                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                      
Code:                                                                                                                                                 
```py                                                                                                                                                 
result = web_search(query="capital of Estonia")                                                                                                       
final_answer(result)                                                                                                                                  
```                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                      
But I need to make sure that the web_search returns the correct answer. If the search returns the capital, then the code is correct. If not, maybe the
assistant needs to visit a specific webpage. But given that the question is straightforward, the web_search should work.                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Another possibility is that the assistant might need to visit a specific webpage, but since the user hasn't provided any specific URLs, the assistant 
can't know which one to visit. So using the web_search tool is the right approach here.                                                               
                                                                                                                                                      
So the plan is to use the web_search tool with the query "capital of Estonia" and then return the result as the final answer.                         
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the capital of Estonia.                                                                               
Code:                                                                                                                                                 
```py
