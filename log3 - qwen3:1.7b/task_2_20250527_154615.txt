<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking who wrote "Pride and Prejudice". I need to figure out the answer. From what I remember, Pride and Prejudice is a novel by    
Jane Austen. But maybe I should verify this using the available tools.                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                      
Looking at the tools provided, there's a wiki function. I can use that to look up the author. Let me call the wiki function with the query "Pride and 
Prejudice author". The wiki should return the author's name. Once I get that information, I can present it as the final answer.                       
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the `wiki` tool to find the author of "Pride and Prejudice".

Okay, the user is asking who wrote "Pride and Prejudice". I remember that Jane Austen is the author, but I need to confirm this. The previous attempt 
tried using the wiki tool, but there was an error because the tool wasn't allowed. Let me think of another way.                                       
                                                                                                                                                      
Since the wiki tool isn't available, maybe I can use web search. The user's system has a web search function. I can perform a web search for the      
author of "Pride and Prejudice" using the web_search tool. Then, I can extract the answer from the search results.                                    
                                                                                                                                                      
So the steps are: use web_search with the query "Pride and Prejudice author", retrieve the results, and then parse the first result to get the        
author's name. Finally, return that name as the final answer.
