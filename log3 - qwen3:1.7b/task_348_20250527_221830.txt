<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Kazakhstan. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have.                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The available tools are web_search and visit_webpage. Maybe a web search would work here. I can use the web_search function with the query "capital of Kazakhstan". Let me check 
if that's sufficient.                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the user might want the most recent information. But since the tools are notional, I'll proceed with a search. The code would be something like:                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
pope_age_wiki = wiki(query="current pope age")                                                                                                                                   
print("Pope age as per wikipedia:", pope_age_wiki)                                                                                                                               
pope_age_search = web_search(query="current pope age")                                                                                                                           
print("Pope age as per google search:", pope_age_search)                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
But for this task, it's about the capital. So the query should be "capital of Kazakhstan". Let me write the code.                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll use web_search with that query. Then, the result will be the capital. Then, I can print the answer.                                                                         
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the capital of Kazakhstan.                                                                                                       
Code:
