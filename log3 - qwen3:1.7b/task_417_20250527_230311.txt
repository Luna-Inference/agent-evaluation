<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Austria. I need to figure out how to get that information. Let me think about the tools I have available. 
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I remember that in the previous examples, the assistant used web search and wiki tools. So maybe I can use a web search here. The question is  
straightforward, so I can use the web_search function with the query "capital of Austria".                                                            
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the tools mentioned are web_search and visit_webpage, but the user's task is to find the capital. So the code would be something like calling   
web_search with the query. Then, once I get the results, I can extract the capital from the first result.                                             
                                                                                                                                                      
But the assistant's code needs to be written step by step. Let me structure it. First, perform the web search, then process the result to find the    
capital. However, the code must be in Python, using the tools provided.                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                      
So the code would be:                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
Code:                                                                                                                                                 
```py                                                                                                                                                 
capital = web_search(query="capital of Austria")                                                                                                      
final_answer(capital)                                                                                                                                 
```                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                      
But I need to make sure that the web_search returns the correct information. If the first result is the capital, then this should work. If not, maybe 
I need to check more results, but according to the previous examples, the assistant sometimes uses the first result.                                  
                                                                                                                                                      
Alternatively, maybe the assistant should visit the webpage directly. But since the user hasn't provided a specific URL, the code can't use a         
particular URL. So the web_search is the right approach.                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Therefore, the code should call web_search with the query, then output the result. The final answer is the result of the web search.

Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the capital of Austria.
