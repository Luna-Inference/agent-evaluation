Okay, the user is asking for the chemical symbol of copper. I need to figure out what that is. From what I remember, copper is a metal, and its symbol is Cu. But maybe I should 
verify this using a reliable source.                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the tools available include a wiki search and web search. Let me use the wiki tool first. The query would be "chemical symbol for copper". Let me check the wiki response. 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
If the wiki returns the symbol as Cu, then I can confirm. If not, maybe I need to do a web search. But since the user expects an accurate answer, I should proceed with the wiki 
search first.                                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So, I'll call the wiki function with the query "chemical symbol for copper". Then, based on the result, I can provide the answer. If the wiki doesn't have the info, I'll use the
web search tool. But given that this is a standard question, the wiki should have the correct answer.

Okay, the user is asking for the chemical symbol of copper. I tried using the wiki tool earlier, but the system rejected it because the function 'wiki' wasn't allowed. Hmm,     
maybe I need to use a different approach since the allowed tools are limited.                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the allowed tools include web_search and visit_webpage, but not wiki. So I can't use the wiki function. I need to find another way to get the information. Since I can't   
use the wiki tool, I'll have to rely on my existing knowledge. From what I remember, copper's symbol is Cu. But maybe I should verify this through a web search using the allowed
tools.                                                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Let me try the web_search tool with the query "chemical symbol for copper". That should fetch the correct answer. Let's proceed.
