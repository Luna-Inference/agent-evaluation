<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking for a famous composer from the Classical period. Let me think about the time frame. The Classical period in music history is 
generally considered to be from approximately 1750 to 1820. During this time, composers like Mozart, Bach, and Haydn are prominent. Mozart is often   
cited as one of the most famous composers of the Classical era. Bach is more associated with the Baroque period, but he did have some works in the    
Classical style. Haydn is another key figure, known for his symphonies and string quartets.                                                           
                                                                                                                                                      
I need to confirm which of these is the most commonly named example. Since the question is straightforward, the answer is likely Mozart. But maybe I  
should check if there's any other notable composer. However, given the common knowledge, Mozart is the most recognized. I should also consider if     
there's a need to verify through a tool, but since the tools available are web search and wiki, perhaps a web search would help. But the user didn't  
specify needing to use tools, so maybe it's acceptable to answer directly. However, the instructions say to use tools if possible. Wait, the tools    
include web_search and wiki. So maybe I should use web_search to confirm.                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                      
Let me structure the thought process. Use web_search to find a notable composer from the Classical period. Then present the answer. But since the user
is asking for a name, and the answer is straightforward, maybe the assistant can just state Mozart. But following the tool usage rules, perhaps the   
assistant should use the web_search tool to get the answer. However, in the previous examples, when the answer was known, the assistant used the      
final_answer without tools. But here, since the user hasn't specified needing tools, maybe it's acceptable to answer directly. However, the assistant 
should follow the rules strictly. The rules say to use tools when needed. Since the answer is common knowledge, maybe the assistant can proceed       
without tools. But to comply with the rules, perhaps the assistant should use the web_search tool to get the answer. Let me check the tools again. The
available tools are web_search and wiki. So the assistant can use web_search to find the answer. Let's proceed with that.                             
</think>
