<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Saudi Arabia. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have.                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The available tools are web_search and visit_webpage. Maybe a web search would be the best approach here. I can use the web_search function with the query "capital of Saudi     
Arabia".                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the user might expect a direct answer, but I should verify using a reliable source. Let me perform the search. If the search returns the capital, I can extract it. If not,
maybe check another source. But according to the tools, I can only use web_search. So I'll proceed with that.                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll write a code snippet that uses web_search with the query. Then, once I get the result, I can print it and finally answer the question.

Okay, so the user asked for the capital of Saudi Arabia. I used the web_search tool with the query "capital of Saudi Arabia". The search results listed Riyadh as the capital.   
The observation shows that the web search returned multiple sources confirming Riyadh is the capital. Since the tools are web_search and visit_webpage, and the answer is        
straightforward from the search results, I can now provide the final answer.                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The code executed the search and printed the result. The observation confirms that Riyadh is the capital. So the answer is Riyadh. I need to make sure to present this in the    
final_answer.
