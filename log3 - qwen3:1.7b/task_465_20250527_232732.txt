<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Russia. I need to find that out. Let me think about the tools I have. There's the wiki tool, which can be 
used to look up information. Also, web search tools. Since the answer is straightforward, maybe using the wiki tool would be best.                    
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I should check if the wiki tool can provide the capital. The wiki query would be "capital of Russia". Let me call that. If the wiki returns the
correct information, I can use that. If not, maybe a web search. But since the user is expecting a direct answer, probably the wiki will give it.     
                                                                                                                                                      
So the code would be something like using the wiki function with the query "capital of Russia". Then, once I get the answer, I can print it and return
it as the final answer.                                                                                                                               
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the wiki tool to find the capital of Russia.

<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Russia. Earlier, I tried using the wiki tool but got an error because the function wasn't allowed. Now I  
need to find another way to get the answer without using the wiki tool.                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                      
Since the capital of Russia is a known fact, maybe I can directly answer based on my knowledge. The capital is Moscow. But I should confirm this to be
accurate. Alternatively, I can use the web search tool to look up the information. Let me try the web search approach.                                
                                                                                                                                                      
So, I'll use the web_search function with the query "capital of Russia" to get the top result. Then, I can extract the answer from the search results 
and return it.
