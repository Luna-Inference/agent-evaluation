<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking about the main ingredient in haupia. Let me think. Haupia is a type of fruit, right? I remember it's a tropical fruit from the pineapple family. But I  
need to confirm the main ingredient.                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I should check if there's a reliable source or a database that lists the ingredients of haupia. Since I can use web search, I can perform a search to find the            
ingredients. The tool 'web_search' can be used here. The query would be something like "main ingredient in haupia".                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the user might be referring to the fruit itself. Haupia is a tropical fruit, often used in desserts. The main ingredient is probably the fruit itself, but maybe it's a mix
of different fruits. Alternatively, it could be a processed product. Hmm.                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I need to perform a web search to find the exact information. Let me use the web_search tool with the query "main ingredient in haupia". Once I get the results, I can extract   
the answer.                                                                                                                                                                      
</think>
