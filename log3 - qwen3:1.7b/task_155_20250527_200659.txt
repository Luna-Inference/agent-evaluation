Okay, the user is asking who wrote 'Les Misérables'. I need to find the author of this famous French novel. Let me think about the tools I have.                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I can use the web search tool to look up the book's information. The query should be straightforward. Let me check the web search results. If the search returns the      
author's name, I can directly answer. If not, maybe I need to try a different approach, but for now, let's start with the basic search.                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll write a code snippet using the web_search function with the query "Les Misérables author". The code will perform the search and then print the result. If the result        
contains the author's name, I can finalize the answer. If not, I might need to revisit the search with a different keyword, but for now, let's proceed with the initial search.
