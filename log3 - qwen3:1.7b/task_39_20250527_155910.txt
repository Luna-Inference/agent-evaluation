<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking for the main ingredient in guacamole. Let me think about how to approach this.                                               
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I need to recall what guacamole is. Guacamole is a Mexican dish made from avocado, usually with some other ingredients like lime, salt, and    
sometimes onions or cilantro. But the main ingredient is definitely the avocado. However, maybe I should verify this.                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
Since the user might be looking for a more detailed answer, I should check reliable sources. But since I can't access the internet, I need to use the 
tools provided. The available tools are web_search and visit_webpage. Wait, the tools are notional, but in the example, the assistant used web_search.
So I can use web_search to look up the ingredients.                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                      
So the plan is: use web_search with the query "main ingredient in guacamole" to find the answer. Then, based on the search results, determine the main
ingredient. The answer would be avocado, but maybe the search results might mention other ingredients. However, typically, avocado is the main one.   
But to be sure, I should perform the search.                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the user might expect the answer to be avocado, but perhaps the search results could have more details. Let me proceed with the code.           
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the `web_search` tool to find the main ingredient in guacamole.
