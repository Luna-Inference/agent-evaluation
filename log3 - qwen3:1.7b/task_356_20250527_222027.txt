Okay, the user is asking who discovered the law of conservation of momentum in a closed system. Let me think about how to approach this.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I need to recall what the law of conservation of momentum states. It says that in a closed system, the total momentum remains constant over time. The discoverer is likely
a well-known physicist. From what I remember, this law was formulated by Isaac Newton. He mentioned it in his second law of motion, which relates force, mass, and acceleration. 
However, I should verify this.                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Since the user might expect a precise answer, I should use a tool to search for the correct information. The available tools include web search and wiki. Let me use the web     
search function to find the answer.                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll perform a web search for "discovered law of conservation of momentum" to get the most accurate result. Then, I can check the sources to confirm the author. Once I have the 
information, I can present the answer.                                                                                                                                           
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web search tool to find the origin of the law of conservation of momentum.

Momentum is defined to be the mass of an object multiplied by the velocity of the object. The conservation of momentum states that, within some problem domain, the amount of 
momentum remains constant; momentum is neither created nor destroyed, but only changed through the action of forces as described by Newton's laws of motion.

I need to ensure that the final answer is correctly formatted. The user's previous attempt had a code snippet that was invalid, so I need to avoid that. The correct approach is 
to use the final_answer function with the proper syntax. The answer is clearly Newton, so the code should simply output "Sir Isaac Newton" using the final_answer function.      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I should check that the code doesn't have any syntax errors and that the final_answer is properly called. The code should be straightforward, just the final answer statement. No
need for additional steps since the answer is clear.
