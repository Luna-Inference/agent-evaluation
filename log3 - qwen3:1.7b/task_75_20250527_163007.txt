<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking who the author of 'To Kill a Mockingbird' is. I need to figure out how to find this information. Let me think about the tools
available.                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                      
The available tools are web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer. The web_search function can be used to look up the answer. Since the question is 
straightforward, I can use web_search with the query "author of To Kill a Mockingbird".                                                               
                                                                                                                                                      
I should call web_search with the query parameter set to "author of To Kill a Mockingbird". Then, the result will give me the author's name. Once I   
have that, I can use the final_answer tool to present the answer.                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                      
I need to make sure that the web_search is correctly formatted. The parameters should be passed as a dictionary with the key 'query' and the value as 
the question. Let me write the code for that.                                                                                                         
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the author of "To Kill a Mockingbird".
