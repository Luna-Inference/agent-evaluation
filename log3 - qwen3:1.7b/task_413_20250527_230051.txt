Okay, let's tackle the question: "Who wrote 'Felix Holt, the Radical'?"                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I need to figure out how to find the author of this book. Since the user is asking for the author, I should look for information about the     
book. The book title seems familiar; maybe it's a well-known work. I remember that "Felix Holt, the Radical" is a novel by Theodore D. H. Rundel. But 
I'm not sure if that's correct. To confirm, I should search for the book's author.                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                      
I'll use the web search tool to look up the book's author. The query should be something like "Felix Holt, the Radical author". Let me perform the    
search and get the result. Once I have the author's name, I can present it as the final answer.
