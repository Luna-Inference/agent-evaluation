<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the chemical symbol of strontium. I need to figure out what that is. From what I remember, strontium is a chemical element. The periodic table tells
us that elements have symbols based on their atomic number and common names.                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Strontium is in group 2 of the periodic table, and its atomic number is 38. The symbol for strontium is Sr. But wait, maybe I should verify this. Sometimes elements have        
different symbols, especially if they are named after other things. Strontium is named after the city of Strontium in Spain, but the symbol is still Sr.                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Alternatively, I can use a tool to look it up. Since the user might expect an accurate answer, using a web search or a database would be best. But since the available tools     
include web_search and wiki, I can use those. Let me check the tools available.                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The tools are web_search and wiki. So I can perform a web search for "chemical symbol of strontium" to confirm. The answer should be Sr. But I need to make sure. Let me write a 
code snippet to do that.                                                                                                                                                         
</think>
