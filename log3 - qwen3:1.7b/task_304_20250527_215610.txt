<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the chemical symbol of cesium. Let me think about how to approach this.                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I know that chemical symbols are usually abbreviations of the element's name. Cesium is a metal in the alkali metals group. The symbol for cesium is Cs. But maybe I      
should verify this using a reliable source. Since the user might expect the correct answer, but I need to make sure.                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the tools available are web_search and visit_webpage. So I can use web_search to look up the chemical symbol for cesium. Let me construct the query. The query should be   
something like "chemical symbol for cesium" or "cesium element symbol".                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll perform a web search to find the correct symbol. Once I get the result, I can extract the information and return it. Let me write the code for that.                        
</think>
