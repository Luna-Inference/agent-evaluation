<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Canada. I need to find that out. Let me think about the tools I have.                                     
                                                                                                                                                      
Hmm, the available tools are web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer. So maybe I can use web_search with the query "capital of Canada". Let me    
check if that's straightforward.                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the user might want the most recent information. So I should perform a web search to get the current capital. The capital of Canada is Ottawa,  
but I should confirm via the search tool. Let me write the code.                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                      
I'll use the web_search function with the query "capital of Canada". Then, the result should give the answer. Once I get the result, I can print it   
and use final_answer to provide the answer.
