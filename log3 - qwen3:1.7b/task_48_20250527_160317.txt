<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking for the hardest natural substance. I need to figure out how to find this information. Let's think about the tools available. 
The previous examples used web search and wiki queries, so maybe I can use those here.                                                                
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I should check if there's a tool to search for materials' hardness. The user mentioned using the web search function, so I can use that. The   
query should be something like "hardest natural substance" to find relevant information.                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
I'll start by performing a web search to get the top results. Then, I need to parse the results to extract the answer. The answer might be in the form
of a list or a specific sentence from the search results.                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                      
Once I have the information, I can use the final_answer tool to present the result. I should make sure the search is accurate and the answer is       
correctly identified. If the search returns multiple entries, I'll need to pick the one that mentions the hardness. Maybe the answer is something like
"diamond" or "graphite," but I need to confirm from the search results.                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                      
Let me write the code to perform the web search and then process the results.                                                                         
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the web search tool to find the hardest natural substance and then return the final answer.                                       
Code:
