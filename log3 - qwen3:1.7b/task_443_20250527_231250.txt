Okay, the user is asking who wrote the book "Armgart". First, I need to figure out how to find this information. Since I can use web search tools, I  
should start by searching for the book's title.                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                      
I'll use the web_search function with the query "Armgart author". That should retrieve the top results. Then, I'll check the first result to find the 
author's name. If the search returns the author directly, I can extract that information. If not, maybe I need to look through the search results     
carefully. Once I have the author's name, I can present it as the final answer.
