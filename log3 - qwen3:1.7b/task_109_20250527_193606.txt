Okay, the user is asking about the process by which ice turns to water. I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me think.                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I remember that ice turning into water is a phase change. When water freezes, it's called freezing. But the question is about the process, so maybe it's about melting or 
fusion. Wait, ice is solid water, and water is liquid. The process is called melting. But I should verify.                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I should check if there's a specific term for this. In physics, when a solid melts into a liquid, it's called fusion. So the process is fusion. But maybe the user wants the     
steps involved. However, the question is just asking for the process name. So the answer is fusion. But I need to make sure.                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the user might be looking for the scientific term. Let me confirm. Yes, the process is called fusion, and it occurs when a solid (ice) turns into a liquid (water). So the 
answer is fusion. But I should use the tools provided to verify. However, the tools available are web search and wiki. Let me use the web search function to confirm.            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll perform a web search for "process by which ice turns to water". The results should indicate that the process is called fusion. Then I can confirm and provide the answer.

Thought: I will use the web search tool to find the scientific process by which ice turns into water.
