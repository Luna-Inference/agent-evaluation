<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the chemical symbol of krypton. I need to figure out what that is. From what I remember, elements are usually represented by their       
symbol, which is a short, abbreviated form of their name. For example, oxygen is O, hydrogen is H, and so on.                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Krypton is a noble gas, right? I think its symbol is Kr. But wait, maybe I should verify this. Since I can use the web search tool here, I should check a reliable source. Let me
use the web_search function to look up the chemical symbol for krypton.                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So the steps would be: perform a web search for "chemical symbol for krypton", then extract the result. The result should be something like "Krypton: Kr" or similar. Once I get 
that, I can directly answer the user with the symbol.                                                                                                                            
</think>
