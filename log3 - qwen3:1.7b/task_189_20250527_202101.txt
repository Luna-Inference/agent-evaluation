Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Montenegro. Let me think about how to approach this.                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I need to recall if I have any existing knowledge about Montenegro's capital. From what I remember, Montenegro's capital is Podgorica. But I should verify this to be     
sure. However, since the tools available include web search and wiki, I can use those to confirm.                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The tools available are web_search and wiki. So I should use web_search to look up the capital of Montenegro. The query would be something like "capital of Montenegro". Let me  
check the tools' parameters. The web_search function takes a query string. So I can call web_search with the query "capital of Montenegro".                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Once I get the results, I can parse the answer to find the capital. The observation will give me the top results, and I can extract the capital from there. If the web_search    
returns the correct information, I can then use the final_answer tool to provide the answer.                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Alternatively, if the wiki tool is available, I could use that. But since the user didn't specify, web_search is more appropriate here. Let me proceed with the web_search.
