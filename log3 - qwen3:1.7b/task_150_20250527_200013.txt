<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Romania. I need to find that out. Let me think about the tools I have.                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Hmm, the available tools are web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer. Maybe a web search would work here. I can use the web_search function with the query "capital of       
Romania". Let me check if that's feasible.                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the user might expect a straightforward answer. But since the tools are limited, I have to use the web_search. So I'll perform a search for the capital of Romania. Then, I
can retrieve the result and use the final_answer to present it.                                                                                                                  
</think>
