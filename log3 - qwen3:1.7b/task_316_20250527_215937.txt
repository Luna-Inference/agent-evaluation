<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the chemical symbol of rubidium. Let me think about how to approach this.                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I know that chemical symbols are usually abbreviations of the elements' names. Rubidium is a chemical element. From what I remember, the symbol for rubidium is Rb. But I 
should verify this to make sure.                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Since I can use the web search tool, I should perform a search to confirm the correct symbol. The tool web_search can be used with the query "chemical symbol for rubidium".     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Once I get the result, I can extract the symbol from the top search result. Then, I can use the final_answer tool to provide the answer.                                         
</think>
