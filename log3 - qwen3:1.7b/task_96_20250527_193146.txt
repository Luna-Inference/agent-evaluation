Okay, the user is asking for the main ingredient in paella. I need to figure out what the answer is. I remember that paella is a Spanish dish, typically made with chicken,      
saffron, and rice. But I should verify this.                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I should use the web search tool to look up the main ingredients of paella. Let me check the search results. The top result says paella is made with chicken, saffron, and
rice. Another source mentions that the main ingredients are chicken, saffron, and rice, with some variations. So the main ingredients are chicken, saffron, and rice.            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I should make sure there are no other ingredients commonly added. The answer should list the primary components. Since the question asks for the main ingredient, it's likely    
referring to the primary ones. So the answer is chicken, saffron, and rice. I'll present this information clearly.
