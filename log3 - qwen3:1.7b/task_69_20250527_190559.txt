Okay, the user is asking for the main ingredient in hummus. I need to figure out what the answer is. Let me think. Hummus is a traditional Middle Eastern dish, usually made from
chickpeas. But I should confirm this.                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I should check if there are any other ingredients that might be common. Sometimes hummus can have things like olive oil, garlic, or tahini. But the main ingredient is    
typically the chickpeas. Wait, maybe I should look up the standard ingredients. Since I can use web search, I can perform a search to find the standard recipe.                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So the plan is to use the web_search tool with the query "main ingredient in hummus". That should return the standard ingredients. Then I can extract the main one from the      
results. Alternatively, if the search returns a list, I can check the first entry. But since the user wants the main ingredient, the answer is likely chickpeas. However, to be  
accurate, I should perform the search and then process the result.                                                                                                               
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the standard ingredients of hummus and identify the main ingredient.

Okay, so the user asked, "What is the main ingredient in hummus?" Based on the web search results, I need to determine the primary ingredient. The search results mention that   
chickpeas are the main ingredient, but sometimes other ingredients like tahini, olive oil, garlic, and lemon juice are included. However, the question asks for the main         
ingredient, which typically refers to the primary component. From the results, it's clear that chickpeas are the essential part. The other ingredients are added for flavor and  
texture. Therefore, the answer should be chickpeas. I should confirm this by checking the most reliable source, which is the WebMD article. The article states that chickpeas are
the main ingredient, providing protein, carbs, and fiber. So the final answer is chickpeas.
