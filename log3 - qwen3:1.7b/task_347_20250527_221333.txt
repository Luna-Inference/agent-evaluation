<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking who wrote "Mrs. Dalloway". I need to figure out the answer. Let me think. I remember that "Mrs. Dalloway" is a novel by Virginia Woolf. But maybe I     
should verify this.                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I should check if there's any other possible author. Sometimes, there might be confusion with similar works. But Virginia Woolf is the well-known author of this book.    
However, to be thorough, maybe I can use the web search tool to confirm.                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So, I'll use the web_search function with the query "Who wrote Mrs. Dalloway?" to get the top results. Then, I can check the first result to confirm the author. If the search   
returns the correct information, I can be sure.                                                                                                                                  
</think>
