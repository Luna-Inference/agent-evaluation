Okay, the user is asking about the Roman god of war. From what I remember, in Roman mythology, the primary god associated with war is Mars. But I should verify this.            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I need to confirm whether there's any other god considered significant in Roman mythology related to war. Mars is the god of war, but sometimes he's referred to as God of
War. However, there might be other deities. For example, Juno is the goddess of marriage and women, but not war. Venus is love and beauty. Neptune is the sea god. So the main   
one is Mars.                                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
But to be sure, maybe I should search for the answer. The user might expect the answer to be Mars, but I should check if there's any other possibility. Since the question is    
straightforward, the answer is likely Mars. However, using the tools provided, I can perform a web search to confirm.                                                            
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web search tool to confirm the Roman god of war.
