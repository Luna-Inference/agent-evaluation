<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, let's see. The question is asking who is known as the 'Maid of Orléans'. I remember that Orléans is a city in France, and there's a historical figure associated with it.  
The term "Maid of Orléans" probably refers to a famous person from that area.                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I need to figure out who that person is. I think the Maid of Orléans is a nickname for a historical figure, maybe a noblewoman. From what I recall, she was a French      
noblewoman who was involved in the Hundred Years' War. She was known for her bravery and leadership.                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, maybe she's the wife of the Duke of Orléans? Or perhaps she's a different person. Let me think. There's a famous story about her leading a rebellion against the English in
the 14th century. She was a key figure in the French resistance.                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I need to confirm her name and the correct title. Since I can't perform a web search right now, but maybe I can use the tools provided. The tools available are web_search and   
visit_webpage. So I should use web_search to look up the answer.                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The query would be something like "Maid of Orléans who is she". Let me structure the code to perform a web search with that query. Then, based on the results, I can extract the 
answer.                                                                                                                                                                          
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the `web_search` tool to find the answer about the "Maid of Orléans" and then return the final answer based on the search results.
