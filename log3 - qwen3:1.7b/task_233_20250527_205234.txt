Okay, the user is asking who wrote "The Trial" by Franz Kafka. Let me think about how to approach this.                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I need to find the author of the novel. Since I can use web search tools, I should perform a search to find the author. The tools available include web_search and        
visit_webpage. Maybe a simple web search would suffice here.                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll use the web_search function with the query "Who wrote The Trial?" to get the top results. Then, I can check the first result to find the author's name. If the search       
returns the author directly, I can extract that information. If not, maybe I need to visit the webpage and read the content. But since the user's tools include visiting         
webpages, I can use that to browse the result.                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the user's previous examples show that sometimes you need to visit multiple pages. But in this case, maybe the search result already contains the answer. Let me try the   
web_search first.                                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So the code would be something like:                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
pope_age_wiki = wiki(query="current pope age")                                                                                                                                   
print("Pope age as per wikipedia:", pope_age_wiki)                                                                                                                               
pope_age_search = web_search(query="current pope age")                                                                                                                           
print("Pope age as per google search:", pope_age_search)                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
But for this task, the query is "Who wrote The Trial?" So I need to adjust the code accordingly.                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll write a code snippet to perform a web search for the author of "The Trial". Then, extract the author's name from the result. If the search returns the author directly,     
that's the answer. If not, maybe I need to parse the webpage content. However, since the user's tools include visit_webpage, I can use that to check the first result.           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
But the user's tools are web_search and visit_webpage. So perhaps the web_search returns the answer directly. Let me proceed with that.                                          
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the author of "The Trial" and extract the information from the results.
