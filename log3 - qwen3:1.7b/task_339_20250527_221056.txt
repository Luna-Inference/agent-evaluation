<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Taiwan. I need to figure out how to get that information. Let me think about the tools I have available.                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I remember that the user provided some tools like web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer. So maybe I can use web_search to look up the capital of Taiwan. The        
question is straightforward, but I need to make sure the search is accurate.                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I should construct the query as "capital of Taiwan" to find the relevant information. Using the web_search function with that query should return the top results. Then, I can   
extract the capital from the search results.                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the user's previous examples used web_search and printed the results. So in the code, I'll perform the search, get the result, and then use final_answer to present the    
answer. Let me write the code accordingly.                                                                                                                                       
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the capital of Taiwan and then return the final answer.
