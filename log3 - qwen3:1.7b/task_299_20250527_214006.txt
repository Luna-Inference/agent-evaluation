Okay, the user is asking who wrote "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes". I need to figure out the answer. From what I remember, Sherlock Holmes is a famous detective novel by    
Arthur Conan Doyle. But maybe I should verify this.                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I should check if there's any other possible author. Wait, the title "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes" might be a collection of stories or a particular edition. But the
most well-known work is "The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes" by Doyle. However, I need to make sure there's no confusion with other authors.                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Since the user is asking for the author, I should use a search tool to confirm. Let me use the web_search function with the query "Who wrote The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes?" 
to get the accurate information. Then, I can retrieve the result and provide the answer.
