Okay, the user is asking who discovered the law of conservation of momentum in nuclear physics. Let me think about how to approach this.              
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I need to recall what the law of conservation of momentum states. From what I remember, it's a fundamental principle in physics that states    
that the total momentum of a closed system remains constant over time. But the question specifically mentions nuclear physics, so I should check if   
this law was discovered in that context or if it's a more general law.                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                      
I remember that Newton's laws of motion are related to momentum. Newton's first law is about inertia, and the third law is about action and reaction. 
However, the conservation of momentum is more closely tied to Newton's third law. But the question is about nuclear physics, so maybe it's a more     
recent development or a specific application in that field.                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the law of conservation of momentum is actually a general principle in classical mechanics, not specifically tied to nuclear physics. However,  
in the context of nuclear physics, especially in particle physics, the conservation of momentum is still a fundamental principle. But the discovery   
might be attributed to Newton or another physicist.                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                      
I need to find out who first proposed this law. Let me think. Newton himself formulated the laws of motion, including the conservation of momentum. He
stated that the total momentum of a system remains constant if there are no external forces. This is Newton's third law, but the conservation of      
momentum is a consequence of this.                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                      
However, the question is about nuclear physics. Maybe the law was discovered by someone in that field. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a  
general law and the answer is Newton. But I need to confirm.                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                      
I should search for the historical context. The law of conservation of momentum was first proposed by Isaac Newton. He stated it in his second law,   
which is F = ma, but the conservation of momentum is a result of the third law. So, the answer is Newton. But I need to make sure there's no other    
figure associated with it.                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                      
Alternatively, maybe it's a more recent discovery. But I think Newton is the correct answer here. So the answer would be Isaac Newton.                
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I need to find the originator of the law of conservation of momentum in nuclear physics. Since this is a general physical law, the answer is 
likely Isaac Newton. However, to confirm, I will search for historical context.

The same is true of energy and of angular momentum. These concepts provide shortcuts to the integration. The real importance of energy, momentum and 
angular momentum is only made evident when one considers moving the physical apparatus by translation, rotation or by performing the same experiment 
at different times.

[Conservation of momentum | Definition, Examples, & Facts | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/science/conservation-of-momentum)
conservation of momentum, general law of physics according to which the quantity called momentum that characterizes motion never changes in an 
isolated collection of objects; that is, the total momentum of a system remains constant. Momentum is equal to the mass of an object multiplied by its
velocity and is equivalent to the force required to bring the object to a stop in a unit length of time.

[Conservation of Momentum ‹ OpenCurriculum](https://opencurriculum.org/5450/conservation-of-momentum/)
Generalization of the momentum concept. As with all the conservation laws, the law of conservation of momentum has evolved over time. In the 1800's it
was found that a beam of light striking an object would give it some momentum, even though light has no mass, and would therefore have no momentum 
according to the above definition.

[Conservation of Momentum: Law and Equation - Science Facts](https://www.sciencefacts.net/conservation-of-momentum.html)
The law of conservation of momentum states that "the total momentum of an isolated (closed) system is conserved as long as no external forces are 
acting on it." By isolated system, we mean no matter is exchanged between the system and the surroundings. The conservation of momentum is most 
closely related to Newton's third law.

Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user asked who discovered the law of conservation of momentum in nuclear physics. From the previous         
interaction, I determined that the answer is Isaac Newton. However, the user's code had an error related to regex patterns. The error message         
indicated that the code snippet wasn't properly formatted with the correct regex pattern.                                                             
                                                                                                                                                      
I need to ensure that the code is correctly structured. The user's previous code used a regex pattern that wasn't matching, so I should avoid using   
that pattern. Instead, I'll write a simple Python code snippet that outputs the answer directly, without any regex processing. This way, it avoids the
error and correctly answers the question.                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                      
The code should be straightforward, just printing the answer. Let me check the tools available. The tools include `final_answer`, which can be used to

So the code will be:                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                      
final_answer("Isaac Newton")                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                      
This avoids any regex issues and directly provides the answer. I need to make sure the code is correctly formatted with the right syntax and no       
unnecessary steps. The error was about the regex pattern, so the code should be simple and valid.                                                     
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will directly answer the question using the `final_answer` tool without any regex processing.
