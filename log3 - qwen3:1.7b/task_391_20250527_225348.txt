return details about the typical components. Once I have that information, I can confirm the answer.                                                  
                                                                                                                                                      
I'll start by performing a web search for "main ingredients in sarma" to get the most accurate and recent information. Then, I'll process the results 
to extract the main ingredients mentioned.
