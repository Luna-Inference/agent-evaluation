Okay, the user is asking about the Pythagorean theorem. I need to explain it clearly. Let me think about how to approach this.                        
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I remember that the Pythagorean theorem relates to right-angled triangles. The theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of   
the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. So, if the sides are a and b, then a² + 
b² = c², where c is the hypotenuse.                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                      
I should probably outline the theorem, give an example, and maybe mention its historical context. But since the user just wants the theorem explained,
I need to make sure the explanation is accurate and concise.                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the user didn't specify if they need a formula, a proof, or an application. But the question is straightforward, so the answer should be the    
theorem itself. However, maybe I should also include a simple example to make it clearer.                                                             
                                                                                                                                                      
I should check if there's any need to use tools here. The available tools are web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer. Since the user is asking   
for a definition, a web search might be helpful to confirm the correct statement. But since the user is expecting a direct answer, maybe I can just   
provide the explanation without searching.                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                      
But the rules say to use tools when needed. However, in this case, the information is common knowledge, so maybe it's not necessary. But to be safe,  
perhaps use the web_search tool to verify the correct statement. Let me try that.                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                      
So, the code would be:                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                      
Code:                                                                                                                                                 
```py                                                                                                                                                 
pope_age_wiki = wiki(query="Pythagorean theorem")                                                                                                     
print("Pythagorean theorem as per wikipedia:", pope_age_wiki)                                                                                         
```                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                      
But wait, the user is asking for the theorem, not the age of the pope. Oh, right, the previous example was about the pope's age, but this is a        
different question. So, the code would be:                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the user's question is about the Pythagorean theorem. So, using the wiki tool with the query "Pythagorean theorem" to get the correct           
information. Then, the answer would be the result from the wiki. But since the assistant can't actually perform the wiki search, but in the code, it's
just a placeholder. However, in the actual scenario, the code would use the tool to fetch the information.                                            
                                                                                                                                                      
But according to the rules, the assistant should use the tools as needed. So, the code would be:                                                      
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the `wiki` tool to get the Pythagorean theorem.                                                                                   
Code:                                                                                                                                                 
```py                                                                                                                                                 
pythagorean_theorem = wiki(query="Pythagorean theorem")                                                                                               
final_answer(pythagorean_theorem)                                                                                                                     
```                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                      
But the user might expect a more detailed explanation. However, since the task is to answer the question, and the assistant can't perform a web search
here, but the code is just a placeholder, perhaps the answer is the theorem itself. However, the assistant's code would need to use the tool to get   
the information.                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                      
Alternatively, maybe the assistant can just provide the explanation without using a tool, but according to the rules, the assistant should use the    
tools when needed. Since the user is asking for the theorem, which is a known fact, maybe the assistant can just answer directly. But the rules say to
use tools when needed. However, in this case, the assistant has to use the tools provided.                                                            
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the available tools are web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer. The wiki tool is not listed here. Oh, the user mentioned that the assistant
has access to the tools: the tools are web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer. So, the assistant can't use the wiki tool. Therefore, the         
assistant has to use the available tools. But in the previous examples, the assistant used the wiki tool, but in this case, the assistant doesn't have
that tool. So, the assistant can't use the wiki tool here.                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, looking back at the tools provided:                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                      
The user said: "you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python functions: def web_search(query: string) -> string: ... def         
visit_webpage(url: string) -> string: ... def final_answer(answer: any) -> any: ..."                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                      
So, the assistant can't use the wiki tool. Therefore, the assistant has to use web_search or visit_webpage. But the question is about the Pythagorean 
theorem, which is a known fact. So, the assistant can answer directly without using any tools. However, the assistant's code would need to use the    
tools if possible.                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                      
But in this case, the assistant can just provide the answer directly. However, the rules say to use the tools when needed. Since the assistant can't  
use the wiki tool, but can use web_search. So, perhaps the assistant can perform a web search to find the theorem.                                    
                                                                                                                                                      
So, the code would be:                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the `web_search` tool to find the Pythagorean theorem.

final_answer(theorem)                                                                                                                                 
```                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                      
But the assistant's code would then output the result. However, in the previous example, the assistant used the web_search tool and got the result.   
So, the final answer would be the result of the web search.                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                      
But the assistant needs to make sure that the answer is correct. The Pythagorean theorem is "In a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse 
is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides." So, the code would return that.                                                           
                                                                                                                                                      
Therefore, the final answer would be the result of the web_search.

Okay, the user is asking about the Pythagorean theorem. The previous attempt tried using a 'wiki' tool, but the system didn't allow that because it's 
not among the allowed tools. So I need to find another way to answer without using the wiki function.                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
Since the Pythagorean theorem is a fundamental mathematical concept, I can explain it directly. The theorem states that in a right-angled triangle,   
the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. So, if the sides are a and
b, then a² + b² = c², where c is the hypotenuse.                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                      
I don't need to use any tools here because the information is common knowledge. The answer can be provided directly. Let me make sure the explanation 
is clear and accurate.
