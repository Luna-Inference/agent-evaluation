Okay, the user wants a short poem about the ocean. Let me think about how to approach this.                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I need to create a poem. The ocean is vast, deep, and full of life. Maybe use imagery like waves, tides, underwater creatures, and the moon. Since it's a short poem,     
perhaps four to five stanzas.                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I should start with a strong opening line. Maybe something about the ocean's vastness. Then describe the waves, the moon's reflection, and the underwater world. End with a line 
about the ocean's mystery or beauty.                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I need to make sure the rhyme scheme is consistent. Maybe AABB or ABAB. Let's go with AABB for simplicity.                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Let me draft the first stanza: "The ocean's breath, a whispered song, / In every wave, a story told." Then the second stanza about waves and tides. Third stanza about the moon  
and stars. Fourth stanza about the deep and mystery.                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Check the syllables per line to maintain rhythm. Maybe each line has 8-10 syllables. Let me adjust lines as needed.                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Once the poem is written, I can present it as the final answer. No need for tools here since it's a creative task.

Thought: I will compose a simple poem about the ocean using descriptive language and a consistent rhyme scheme.

In every wave, a story told.  
Tides rise and fall, a rhythmic dance,  
Reflecting moonlight on the shore.  

Deep below, creatures in a maze,  
Fighting shadows, secrets to unveil.  
From coral gardens to endless depths,  
The ocean's mystery remains.

Through storms and calms, the heart of the world.  
No borders, no limits, just the sea,  
Where dreams and reality meet.
