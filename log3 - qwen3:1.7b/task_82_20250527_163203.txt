Okay, the user is asking about the Roman god of war. I need to figure out the answer. From what I remember, in Roman mythology, Mars is the god of    
war. But I should verify this.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I should use the web search tool to check the latest information. Let me perform a web search for "Roman god of war" to confirm. The search    
results might mention Mars. Then, I can use the wiki tool to get a more detailed explanation. Alternatively, maybe the wiki tool can directly provide 
the answer. Let me structure the code to first search for the answer and then retrieve the details if needed.                                         
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the user wants the answer directly. So maybe the web search will give the straightforward answer. Let me write code to perform the search and   
then extract the answer from the results. If the search returns something like "Mars is the Roman god of war," then that's the answer. Otherwise, I   
might need to look into more details. But given the context, the answer is likely Mars.                                                               
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the web search tool to find the Roman god of war.
