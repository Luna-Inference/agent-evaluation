<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Bhutan. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have.                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I can use the web search tool to look up Bhutan's capital. The web_search function can be used here. The query would be "capital of Bhutan". Let me check if there's any  
existing information I can use. Oh, maybe the answer is straightforward. If the web search returns the capital, then I can directly get it. But since I can't browse the web in  
this simulation, I have to rely on the tools provided. Wait, the tools include a web search function. So I'll call web_search with the query "capital of Bhutan". Then, the      
result will be the answer. Once I have the result, I can use the final_answer tool to present it.                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Alternatively, maybe there's a predefined answer. But since the user is expecting me to use the tools, I should proceed step by step. Let me write the code to perform the web   
search and then extract the capital from the result.                                                                                                                             
</think>
