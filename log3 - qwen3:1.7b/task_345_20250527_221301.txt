Okay, the user is asking for the capital of North Korea. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have.                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I remember that the 'wiki' tool can be used to look up information. So I'll use that. The query should be "capital of North Korea". Let me check if there's a specific    
tool for this. The wiki tool seems appropriate here.                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll call the wiki function with the query. Then, I can retrieve the answer. If the wiki tool returns the correct information, I can present it as the final answer. If not,     
maybe I need to use another method, but for now, let's try the wiki first.                                                                                                       
</think>

Okay, the user is asking for the capital of North Korea. Earlier, I tried using the wiki tool but got an error because the function wasn't allowed. Now I need to figure out     
another way to get the answer without using the wiki tool.                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Since the wiki tool isn't available, maybe I can use a web search. The web_search function can be used here. I'll set the query to "capital of North Korea" and retrieve the     
results. Then, I can extract the answer from the search results.
