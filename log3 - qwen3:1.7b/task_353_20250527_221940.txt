<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, I need to find out who wrote "A Room of One's Own." Let me think about how to approach this.                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I remember that "A Room of One's Own" is a famous book by Virginia Woolf. But maybe I should verify this through a search to be sure. The user might want the exact       
author, so using a web search would be the best approach.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll use the web_search tool with the query "A Room of One's Own author." That should return the top results. Then, I can check the first result to confirm the author. If the   
search returns the correct information, I can extract the author's name and present it as the final answer.                                                                      
</think>
