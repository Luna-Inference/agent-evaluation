Okay, let's tackle the question: "Who discovered the law of conservation of energy?"                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I need to figure out how to find the answer. Since this is a historical question, I should look for reliable sources. The user mentioned using tools like web_search and  
wiki, so I'll use those.                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll start by performing a web search to find the origin of the law of conservation of energy. The search query should be straightforward. Then, I'll check the results to       
determine who is credited with discovering it.                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the law of conservation of energy is a fundamental principle in physics. It's often attributed to James Prescott Joule, but I need to confirm. Maybe there's a more        
detailed source. Let me use the web_search tool with the query "who discovered the law of conservation of energy".                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Once I get the results, I'll look for the author or the person mentioned in the sources. If the search returns multiple sources, I'll check which one is most credible. If the   
answer is directly from a reputable source, I can use that. If not, I might need to do another search.                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Alternatively, using the wiki tool might provide a more structured answer. But since the user mentioned using web_search, I'll prioritize that.                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So the steps are: perform a web search, collect the results, identify the author, and then present the answer.                                                                   
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the origin of the law of conservation of energy and then extract the answer from the results.

[Who Discovered the Law of Conservation of Energy? (Description)](https://thepowerfacts.com/who-discovered-the-law-of-conservation-of-energy/)
In 1845, German physician Julius Robert von Mayer discovered the law of conservation of energy while studying human metabolism. This discovery led to the development of the 
first law of thermodynamics. The law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, but it can be converted from one form to another.

James Prescott Joule (born December 24, 1818, Salford, Lancashire [now in Greater Manchester], England—died October 11, 1889, Sale, Cheshire) was an English physicist who 
established that the various forms of energy—mechanical, electrical, and heat—are basically the same and can be changed one into another.Thus, he formed the basis of the law of 
conservation of energy, the first law of ...

[Law of Conservation of Energy - Science Notes and Projects](https://sciencenotes.org/law-of-conservation-of-energy/)
The law of conservation of energy is a physical law that states that the total energy of an isolated system is a constant, although energy can change forms.In other words, 
energy is conserved over time. The law of conservation of energy is the first law of thermodynamics.French mathematician and philosopher Émilie du Châtelet first proposed and 
tested the law in the 18th century.

At almost the same time the discovery of a fixed numerical relation between heat and work was made by two very different men, Julius Robert Mayer (1814-1878) and James Prescott 
Joule (I818-I889). Mayer, a German physician on a Dutch.ship, dis- covered the law of conservation of energy by a sudden intuition.

Julius Mayer, a German physicist, was the first person to state the law of the conservation of energy, in an 1842 scientific paper. Mayer experimentally determined the 
mechanical equivalent of heat from the heat evolved in the compression of a gas (without appreciating that heat could be explained in terms of kinetic theory). ...

James Prescott Joule. Heat and energy. Salford, December 24, 1818 - Sale, October 11, 1889. Joule studied the characteristics of heat and discovered the relationship with 
energy. This led to the law of conservation of energy (first law of thermodynamics). The SI power unit, July, is named after him.

One would have thought that the conservation of energy was discovered from the conservation of mechanical energy, but that was not really the case. The conservation of 
mechanical energy has actually played only a very minor role. Carnot made the link between work and kinetic energy quite early, but it was not until the 1820s before this link
