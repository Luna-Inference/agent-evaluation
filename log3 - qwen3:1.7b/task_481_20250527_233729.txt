<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking for the currency of India. Let me think about how to approach this.                                                          
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I need to determine the correct currency code for India. From my knowledge, India uses the Indian Rupee, which is denoted as INR. But to be    
sure, I should verify this information. However, the tools available here are web_search and visit_webpage. So I should use those to confirm.         
                                                                                                                                                      
I'll start by performing a web search to find the official currency of India. The query should be something like "currency of India" or "Indian       
currency". Let me use the web_search tool with that query.                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                      
Once I get the results, I can check the top search results to find the correct answer. If the search returns a reliable source, like a financial      
website or a government page, that's the official currency. If there's ambiguity, I might need to look for more details. But for now, assuming the    
first result is accurate, the answer should be INR.                                                                                                   
</think>
