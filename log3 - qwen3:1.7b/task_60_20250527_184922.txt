<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking who wrote "Hamlet". I need to figure out how to find this information. Let's think about the tools available. The user mentioned using the web search   
tool, so I should use that.                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I should perform a web search to find the author of Hamlet. The query should be straightforward. Maybe something like "who wrote Hamlet" or "author of Hamlet". I'll use  
the web_search function with that query.                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Once I get the results, I need to parse them to find the author. The search results might list the author along with other information. I'll check the first few results to see  
if the author is mentioned. If the search returns the correct information, I can extract the author's name.                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
If the search doesn't immediately give the answer, maybe I need to look for more specific sources, like literary databases or famous quotes. But for now, let's start with the   
initial search.                                                                                                                                                                  
</think>
