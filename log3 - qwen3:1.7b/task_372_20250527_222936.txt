<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Belarus. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have.                            
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I can use the web search tool to look up the capital of Belarus. The web_search function would be appropriate here. The query should be        
"capital of Belarus". Let me check the tools again. The web_search function takes a query string and returns the top results.                         
                                                                                                                                                      
I'll call web_search with the query "capital of Belarus". Then, I can parse the result to find the capital. The result might be a string like "The    
capital of Belarus is Minsk." So I can use a print statement to output the answer.                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                      
Alternatively, if there's a Wikipedia entry, the wiki tool could also be used. But since the user didn't specify, web_search is more direct. Let me   
proceed with that.                                                                                                                                    
</think>
