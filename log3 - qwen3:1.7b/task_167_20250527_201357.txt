<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking who wrote "The Count of Monte Cristo." I need to figure out how to find this information. Let's think about the tools available. The user mentioned     
using web search and visiting web pages, so maybe I can use the web_search function.                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I should perform a web search for the book title. The query might be something like "The Count of Monte Cristo author." Then, I need to check the results to find the     
author. The answer would be the author's name from the search results.                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I should make sure to use the correct tool parameters. The web_search function takes a query string, so I'll set the query to "The Count of Monte Cristo author." Then, I'll     
print the results to see what information is available. Once I have the author's name, I can use the final_answer tool to provide the answer.
