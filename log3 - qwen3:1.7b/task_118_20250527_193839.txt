<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the chemical symbol of sodium. I need to figure out what that is. From what I remember, sodium is a metal in the periodic table. The symbols are    
usually one or two letters. Sodium is often represented by the symbol Na. But maybe I should verify this.                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the tools available here are web_search and visit_webpage. So maybe I should use web_search to look up the chemical symbol for sodium. Let me check the tools again. The   
web_search function takes a query string. So I can call web_search with the query "chemical symbol for sodium" to get the result.                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Alternatively, maybe the user expects a direct answer. But since the tools are available, I should use them. Let me structure the code. The code would be something like:        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
web_search("chemical symbol for sodium")                                                                                                                                         
Then, the observation would return the result. Once I get the result, I can extract the chemical symbol and put it in the final answer.                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
But how to handle the result? The web_search function returns a string, which I can parse. For example, if the result is "Sodium's chemical symbol is Na.", then the answer is   
Na.                                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So the steps are: perform the web search, get the result, extract the symbol, and return it.                                                                                     
</think>
