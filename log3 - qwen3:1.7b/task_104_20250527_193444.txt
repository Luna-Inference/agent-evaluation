Okay, the user is asking for the largest lake in Africa. Let me think about how to approach this.                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I need to find the population of the largest lakes in Africa. I remember that Lake Victoria is the largest lake in Africa by surface area. But maybe I should verify this 
with some sources. Since the tools available include web search and visiting webpages, I can use the web_search function to check the latest information.                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So, I'll use the web_search tool with the query "largest lake in Africa". The result should give me the answer. Once I get the information, I can extract the name of the largest
lake and provide that as the final answer.
