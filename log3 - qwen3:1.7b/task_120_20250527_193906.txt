<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Greece. I need to find that out. Let me think about the tools I have. There's the wiki tool, which can be used to look up            
information. Also, web search tools. Since the question is straightforward, maybe using the wiki tool would be best.                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I should check if the wiki tool can provide the capital. The wiki query would be "capital of Greece". Let me call that. If the wiki returns the correct information, I can
use that. If not, maybe a web search. But since the user wants the answer, and the wiki is a tool, I'll proceed with that.                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So the code would be something like:                                                                                                                                             
pope_age_wiki = wiki(query="capital of Greece")                                                                                                                                  
print("Capital of Greece:", pope_age_wiki)                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Then, if the output is correct, I can finalize the answer. But wait, the user might expect a direct answer. Let me make sure the wiki returns the correct capital, which is      
Athens. But since the tools are notional, I'll just use the tool and then provide the answer.                                                                                    
</think>

Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Greece. Earlier, I tried using the `wiki` tool but got an error because the tool wasn't allowed. Now I need to find another way to   
get the answer without using the `wiki` function.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Since the `wiki` tool is not available, I'll have to use a different method. Maybe a web search? But the user's tools include `web_search` and `visit_webpage`. Let me try using 
`web_search` with the query "capital of Greece" to get the answer.                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So the plan is: use `web_search` to find the capital of Greece, then extract the answer from the search results. I'll write code to perform the web search and then print the    
result. Finally, use the `final_answer` tool to provide the answer.                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I need to make sure the code is correct. The `web_search` function should return the top result, which is likely the capital. Then, the answer can be retrieved from that result.
Let me write the code accordingly.
