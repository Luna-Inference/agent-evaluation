<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking for the currency of Japan. I need to figure out what the correct answer is. From what I remember, Japan uses the yen as their
official currency. But maybe I should verify this with some sources.                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                      
Hmm, the tools available include web search and wiki. Let me use the web search function to check the latest information. The query should be         
"currency of Japan". Let me perform a web search to confirm.                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the user might want the most up-to-date information. So I'll use the web_search tool with the query "currency of Japan". Then, I can retrieve   
the results and extract the currency code. Alternatively, if the web search returns a direct answer, I can just take that. But since the tools are    
notional, I'll simulate the process.                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                      
Once I get the result, I can check if the currency is yen. If the search returns something like "The currency of Japan is the yen (¥)", then the      
answer is straightforward. If not, maybe I need to parse the response. But for now, let's proceed with the code.                                      
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the currency of Japan.
