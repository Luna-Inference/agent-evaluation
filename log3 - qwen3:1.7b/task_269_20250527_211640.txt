<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, I need to find out who wrote 'Wuthering Heights'. Let me think about how to approach this.                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I remember that 'Wuthering Heights' is a novel by Emily Brontë. But maybe I should verify this. Since the user might not be familiar with the author, I should check a    
reliable source.                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I can use the web search tool to look up the author of the book. The query should be straightforward. Let me try searching for "Wuthering Heights author" to get the result. If  
the search returns the correct information, I can confirm the author. If not, maybe I need to search for the book's title and author separately. But given that Emily Brontë is  
the well-known author, the search should return that. Let me proceed with the code.                                                                                              
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web search tool to find the author of "Wuthering Heights".
