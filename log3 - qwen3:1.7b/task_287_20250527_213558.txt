<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking who wrote the book "David Copperfield". Let me think about how to approach this.                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I need to find the author of the book. Since I can use web search tools, I should perform a search to find the author. The tool available is web_search, which takes a    
query. The query should be something like "David Copperfield author" or "Who wrote David Copperfield".                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I should use the web_search function with the appropriate query. Let me check if there's any existing information I can use. Maybe the book is a well-known work, so the search  
should return the author quickly.                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Once I get the search results, I can parse the information to find the author. The results might list the author directly. If the search returns the author's name, I can then   
use the final_answer tool to present the result.                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I need to make sure that the search is accurate. If the search returns the correct author, then the answer is straightforward. If not, maybe I need to refine the query. But     
given that "David Copperfield" is a well-known book, the search should be effective.                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So, the steps are: perform a web search for the author of "David Copperfield", extract the author's name from the results, and then return that name as the final answer.
