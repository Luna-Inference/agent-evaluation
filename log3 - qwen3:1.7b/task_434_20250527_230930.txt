Okay, let's tackle this question: "Who discovered the law of conservation of energy in particle physics?"                                             
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I need to recall what the law of conservation of energy is. From what I remember, it's a fundamental principle in physics that states energy   
cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another. But the question specifically mentions particle physics, so I should focus 
on the contributions from that field.                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
I think the law of conservation of energy was first formulated by Julius von Mayer in the 19th century. However, I'm not sure if he worked in particle
physics. Wait, maybe it's more related to the work of Michael Faraday or other physicists. Let me think.                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
In particle physics, the conservation of energy is a cornerstone, but the original discovery might be from classical physics. The law was first       
recognized by Mayer, who proposed it in 1842. But I need to verify this.                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Since the question is about particle physics, maybe the answer is someone like Einstein, but that's more about relativity. No, the law of conservation
of energy is a classical law. So the answer is Julius von Mayer. But I should check if there's a more recent figure in particle physics who           
contributed to this law. Alternatively, maybe it's a general principle and the discoverer is a broader figure.                                        
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the question is about who discovered it in particle physics. If the law was established in classical physics, then the discoverer is Julius von 
Mayer. However, if there's a specific particle physics context, maybe it's different. But I think the law is a general principle, so the answer would 
be Mayer. But I need to confirm.                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                      
Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the conservation of energy in the context of particle reactions, but the original discovery is still
Mayer. So the answer should be Julius von Mayer.

Thought: I need to find the discoverer of the law of conservation of energy in particle physics. The law is a fundamental principle in physics, but   
its origin is in classical physics. The discoverer is Julius von Mayer, who first proposed it in 1842. However, I should verify this and ensure it's  
relevant to particle physics.

Okay, the user asked who discovered the law of conservation of energy in particle physics. My first approach was to use a search tool, but the system 
indicated that 'search' is not allowed. So I need to find another way to answer this without using external tools.                                    
                                                                                                                                                      
Since the law of conservation of energy is a fundamental principle in physics, and its origin is in classical mechanics, the discoverer is Julius von 
Mayer. However, I need to confirm this without using any external tools. The system's previous attempt used a forbidden function, so I should rely on 
my knowledge base.                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                      
I should recall that Julius von Mayer proposed the law in 1842, and it's considered a foundational concept in thermodynamics. Even though particle    
physics deals with subatomic processes, the law itself is a general principle. Therefore, the answer is Julius von Mayer.                             
                                                                                                                                                      
I should now structure the answer clearly, ensuring it's accurate and compliant with the system's restrictions.
