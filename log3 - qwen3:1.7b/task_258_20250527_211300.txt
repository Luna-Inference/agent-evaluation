<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Pakistan. Let me think about how to approach this.                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I know that the capital of Pakistan is Islamabad. But maybe I should verify this using a reliable source. Since the user might want the most accurate information, I      
should use a web search to confirm.                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I can use the web_search tool to look up the capital of Pakistan. The query would be something like "capital of Pakistan". Let me check the results. If the search returns the   
correct information, I can then provide the answer.                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Alternatively, if there's a direct answer from a wiki or another source, that would be better. But since the user hasn't provided any specific tools, I'll proceed with the web  
search.                                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So, the steps would be: perform a web search for the capital of Pakistan, retrieve the result, and then return that information as the final answer.
