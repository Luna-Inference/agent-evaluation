<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Iran. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have.                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Hmm, the available tools are web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer. Since the question is straightforward, maybe a web search would work. I can use the web_search function
with the query "capital of Iran".                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, but the user might want the most recent information. Let me check if there's a need for a specific source. But since the tools don't have a specific database, just a      
general search. So I'll perform the search and then retrieve the result.                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I should write a code snippet that uses web_search with the query. Then, once the result is obtained, use final_answer to present the answer. Let me make sure the code is       
correct. The code would be something like:                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
web_search("capital of Iran")                                                                                                                                                    
final_answer(result)                                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
But I need to make sure that the web_search returns the correct capital. The capital of Iran is Tehran, so the code should return that. However, since the tool's output is not  
predictable, I have to rely on the search result. But according to the example, the code would print the result and then final_answer would use it. So the code should be as     
follows.                                                                                                                                                                         
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the capital of Iran.                                                                                                             
Code:
