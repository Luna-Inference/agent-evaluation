Okay, the user is asking who painted 'Starry Night'. I need to figure out the answer. Let me think about the tools I have.                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I remember that 'Starry Night' is a well-known painting by Vincent van Gogh. But maybe the user wants me to confirm this through a search. The tools available include web
search and visiting web pages. So I should use the web_search function to check the exact details.                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll use the web_search tool with the query "Who painted Starry Night?" to get the top results. Then, I can parse the results to find the artist's name. If the search returns   
the correct information, I can extract the answer. If not, maybe I need to look for more details. But given that Starry Night is a classic, the answer should be straightforward.

Okay, the user is asking who painted "Starry Night". From the previous interaction, the web search results clearly state that Vincent van Gogh painted it. The initial code tried
to use a regex pattern that wasn't valid, which caused an error.

The user's latest message shows an error about a regex pattern not being found. The code snippet was invalid because of the regex pattern. To fix this, I should remove the regex
part and use a simple final_answer statement. Since the answer is already determined to be Vincent van Gogh, I can directly call the final_answer function with that answer. No
