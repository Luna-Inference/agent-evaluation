<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Brunei. Let me think about how to approach this.                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I need to find the capital city of Brunei. I remember that Brunei is a small country in Southeast Asia, and its capital is Bandar Seri Begawan. But maybe I should verify 
this using a reliable source. Since the user might expect an accurate answer, I should use a web search to confirm.                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I can use the web_search tool to look up "capital of Brunei" and get the top result. Then, I can check the first result to find the correct capital. If the search returns the   
information directly, I can extract it. If not, maybe I need to visit the webpage and read the content. But according to the tools available, the web_search function returns the
top results, so I can process that.                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So the steps would be: perform a web search for "capital of Brunei", get the results, and then extract the capital from the first result. Then, use the final_answer tool to     
provide the answer.                                                                                                                                                              
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the capital of Brunei and then extract the information from the results.
