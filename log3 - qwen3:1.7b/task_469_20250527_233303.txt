Okay, the user is asking for the main ingredient in buuz. First, I need to figure out what "buuz" refers to. Buuz is a type of food in some cultures, 
like in Mongolia, where it's a traditional dish. But I should confirm the exact meaning.                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Since the user is asking for the main ingredient, I should look up the ingredients of buuz. The tool available is web_search, so I'll use that to find
the information. The query should be "main ingredient in buuz" to get the relevant results.                                                           
                                                                                                                                                      
I'll perform a web search for the ingredients of buuz. Then, I'll check the top results to find the answer. If the search returns the ingredients, I  
can extract the main one. If not, maybe the search result will mention it directly. Once I have the information, I can present the answer.

Okay, so the user asked, "What is the main ingredient in buuz?" Let me think. Buuz is a traditional Mongolian dish, right? From the web search        
results, I saw that the ingredients vary, but the most common ones are meat filling. The search results mention mutton or beef, onions, garlic, and   
spices. The main ingredient seems to be the meat, especially mutton or beef. The answer should be the primary component, which is the meat filling.   
Let me check the results again to confirm. Yes, the majority of the recipes mention mutton or beef as the main ingredient. So the final answer is     
meat, specifically mutton or beef, but since the question asks for the main ingredient, the answer is the meat filling. I need to present this        
clearly.
