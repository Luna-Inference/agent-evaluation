Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Tonga. Let me think about how to approach this.                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I know that the capital of Tonga is Nukuʻalofa. But maybe I should verify this using a reliable source. Since the user might expect an accurate answer, I should check if 
there's a tool available to look up geographical information.                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Looking at the tools provided, there's a web search function. So I can use that to search for "capital of Tonga" to confirm. The web search tool would return the top results,   
and I can parse those results to find the capital.                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll write a code snippet that uses the web_search function with the query "capital of Tonga". Then, I'll extract the first result and determine the capital from there. If the  
search returns the correct information, I can finalize the answer.                                                                                                               
</think>
