<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of New Zealand. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have available. There's the web_search function, which  
can perform a search based on a query. The query here would be "capital of New Zealand". I should use that tool to get the answer.                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the user might want the most recent information, so using a reliable source. The web_search function returns the top results. I'll call web_search with the query. Then, I 
can check the first result to find the capital. Once I have the answer, I can use the final_answer tool to present it.                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I should make sure the code is correct. The code will perform the search, retrieve the result, and then output the capital. Let me write the code step by step.
