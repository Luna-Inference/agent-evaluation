Okay, the user is asking who discovered the theory of special relativity. I need to figure out the answer. From what I remember, Einstein is the main figure here. But maybe I   
should verify it.                                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I should check if there's any other possible discoverer. But I think Einstein is the primary one. However, to be thorough, maybe I can use the web search tool to confirm.
Let me use the web_search function with the query "who discovered the theory of special relativity".                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Once I get the results, I can parse them to find the answer. If the search returns that Einstein is the correct answer, then I can present that. If there's any other name       
mentioned, I need to check that as well. But given the common knowledge, it's Einstein. So the code will perform the search and then output the answer.                          
</think>

[Special relativity - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity)
In physics, the special theory of relativity, or special relativity for short, is a scientific theory of the relationship between space and time. In Albert Einstein 's 1905 
paper, "On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies", the theory is presented as being based on just two postulates: [p 1][1][2] The laws of physics are invariant (identical) in all
inertial frames of reference (that is, frames ...

[The Theory of Relativity, Then and Now - Smithsonian Magazine](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/theory-of-relativity-then-and-now-180956622/)
In 1905 Einstein discovered the special theory of relativity, establishing the famous dictum that nothing—no object or signal—can travel faster than the speed of light.

Einstein also redefined the relationship between space and time, merging them into a four-dimensional continuum known as space-time. While the special theory addressed many 
aspects of physics, it left questions about gravity unanswered, prompting Einstein to develop his general theory of relativity in 1915.
