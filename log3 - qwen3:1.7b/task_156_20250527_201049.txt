<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Croatia. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have. The available tools are web_search and visit_webpage, 
which can retrieve information from the internet. Since the answer is straightforward, I should use web_search with the query "capital of Croatia".                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I'll perform a web search to find the capital. The results should mention that the capital is Zagreb. Once I get the search results, I can extract the capital name from  
the first result. Then, I'll use the final_answer tool to provide the answer.                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I need to make sure the search is accurate. The capital of Croatia is indeed Zagreb, but I should verify through the search. If the web_search returns the correct information, I
can confidently state that Zagreb is the capital. If there's any ambiguity, I'll need to check again, but given the context, the answer should be clear.
