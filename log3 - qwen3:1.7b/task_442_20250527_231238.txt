<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking for the chemical symbol of samarium. Let me think about how to approach this.                                                
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I know that chemical symbols are usually abbreviations of the element's name. Samarium is a transition metal, and its symbol is Sm. But I      
should verify this to be sure. Maybe I can use a search tool to confirm the correct symbol.                                                           
                                                                                                                                                      
Looking at the tools available, there's a web search function. So I'll use that to look up the chemical symbol for samarium. The query would be       
something like "chemical symbol for samarium". The search results should provide the correct abbreviation.                                            
                                                                                                                                                      
Once I get the result, I can extract the symbol and present it as the answer. Since the user wants the answer directly, I'll make sure to use the     
final_answer tool with the obtained symbol.                                                                                                           
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the web search tool to find the chemical symbol for samarium.
