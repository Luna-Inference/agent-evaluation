<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking who wrote "The Great Gatsby." Let me think about how to approach this.                                                       
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I need to find the author of the book. Since I can use web search tools, I should perform a search to find the author. The tools available     
include web_search and visit_webpage. The web_search function can be used with a query like "Who wrote The Great Gatsby?".                            
                                                                                                                                                      
I should check the results from the web search to get the author's name. Once I have the information, I can present the answer. Let me write the code 
to do that.                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the user might expect the answer to be a specific person, like F. Scott Fitzgerald. But I need to make sure the search returns the correct      
information. Let me use the web_search tool with the query "Who wrote The Great Gatsby?" and then extract the author from the results.                
                                                                                                                                                      
I should also consider if there are any other possibilities, but I think the answer is straightforward. The code will perform the search and then     
output the result.                                                                                                                                    
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the web search tool to find the author of "The Great Gatsby" and then return the final answer.
