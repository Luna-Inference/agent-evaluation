<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking who discovered the neutron. I need to find the answer using the tools available. Let me think about the steps.                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I should check if there's a tool that can retrieve information about scientific discoveries. The tools provided include web search and wiki. So maybe using the web search
function with the query "who discovered the neutron" would work.                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll start by performing a web search for the discovery of the neutron. The search should return relevant results. Then, I can parse the results to find the person credited with
discovering it.                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the user might expect the answer to be someone like James Chadwick. But I need to make sure the search returns the correct information. Let me write the code to do a web  
search and then extract the answer from the results.                                                                                                                             
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the answer to the question "Who discovered the neutron?" and then extract the result.

The Compton Effect; Contributors; The story begins in 1932, with the discovery of the neutron by Sir James Chadwick, an English physicist. Until 1932, the atom was known to 
consist of a positively charged nucleus surrounded by enough negatively charged electrons to make the atom electrically neutral. Most of the atom was empty space, with its mass 
concentrated in a tiny nucleus.
