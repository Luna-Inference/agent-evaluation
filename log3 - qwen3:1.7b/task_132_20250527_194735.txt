<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Austria. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools available.                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I can use the web search tool to look up the capital of Austria. The web_search function can be used here. The query would be "capital of Austria". Let me check if       
there's any need for additional steps.                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Alternatively, maybe the wiki tool could help, but since the user didn't specify a particular source, web search is more straightforward. I'll proceed with that.                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So, the code would be to perform a web search with the query "capital of Austria" and then retrieve the result. Once I get the answer, I can present it as the final answer.
