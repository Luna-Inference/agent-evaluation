<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the chemical symbol of indium. Let me think about how to approach this.                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I know that chemical symbols are usually one or two letters, and they are derived from the Latin names of elements. Indium is a metal, and its Latin name is "Indium"     
itself. But I should verify this to be sure.                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Since I can use the web search tool, I should perform a search to confirm the correct symbol. The tool 'web_search' can be used here. The query would be something like "chemical
symbol for indium" to find the answer.                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Once I get the result, I can extract the chemical symbol from the search results. The answer should be something like 'In' because that's the standard symbol for indium.        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I need to make sure that the search is accurate. If the search returns the correct information, I can then provide the answer. If not, maybe I need to check again, but given    
that this is a standard element, the answer should be straightforward.                                                                                                           
</think>
