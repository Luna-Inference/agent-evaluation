Okay, the user is asking who wrote 'The Canterbury Tales'. I need to figure out how to find this information. Let me think about the tools available. The tools mentioned are    
web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer.                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I should use web_search to look up the answer. The query should be "Who wrote The Canterbury Tales?". Since the user might want the direct answer without going through   
multiple steps, I'll perform a quick search.                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the tools don't have a specific function for books, but the web_search can handle that. So I'll call web_search with the query. Then, once I get the result, I can extract 
the author from the top result.                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I need to make sure the search is accurate. If the result is straightforward, like a direct answer, I can use that. If not, maybe visit the webpage to get more details. But     
given the tools, the web_search should return the answer.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So the code would be: call web_search with the query, then check the result. If the result contains the author's name, return that. Otherwise, maybe try another search. But     
according to the examples, the user might expect a direct answer.                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Let me write the code to perform the search and then output the answer.                                                                                                          
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the author of "The Canterbury Tales" and then return the final answer.
