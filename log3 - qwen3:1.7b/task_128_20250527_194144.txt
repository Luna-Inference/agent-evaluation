<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking who discovered penicillin. I need to find the answer using the tools available. Let me think about the steps.                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I should use the web search tool to look up the discovery of penicillin. The query should be "who discovered penicillin". Then, I can retrieve the result and extract the 
information. Since the tools are web_search and visit_webpage, I'll perform a search for the relevant information.                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the tools mentioned are web_search and visit_webpage. The web_search function returns the top results. So I'll call web_search with the query "who discovered penicillin". 
The result will give me the answer. Once I have the answer, I can print it and finalize the answer using the final_answer tool.                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I need to make sure that the code is correct. The code should be straightforward: call web_search with the right query, then process the result. Let me write the code           
accordingly.                                                                                                                                                                     
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the answer to the question "Who discovered penicillin".
