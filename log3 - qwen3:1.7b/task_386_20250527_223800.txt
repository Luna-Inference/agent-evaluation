Okay, the user is asking who discovered the law of conservation of energy in classical mechanics. Let me think about how to approach this.            
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I need to recall historical context. The law of conservation of energy is a fundamental principle in physics. I remember that James Clerk      
Maxwell was involved in the development of classical mechanics, but I'm not sure about the exact discovery. Wait, actually, the law of conservation of
energy was first formulated by Julius von Mayer and later expanded by Samuel Arrhenius. But maybe the question is more about the classical mechanics  
context.                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, in classical mechanics, the law of conservation of energy is part of the principles established by Isaac Newton. However, the exact formulation 
might be attributed to different individuals. Let me check my knowledge here.                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                      
Alternatively, maybe the question is looking for a specific person. I think the law was first stated by Mayer in the 19th century. But I need to      
confirm. Since I can't perform web searches right now, I have to rely on my existing knowledge.                                                       
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the user might expect the answer to be William Thomson (Lord Kelvin), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it could be someone else.                
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, in classical mechanics, the law of conservation of energy is a fundamental principle, but the exact discoverer might be more nuanced. I think   
the law was first formulated by Mayer in 1842, and later popularized by Joule. However, in the context of classical mechanics, it's often attributed  
to Mayer.                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                      
But I need to make sure. Since I can't look it up, I'll go with the most accurate answer based on my knowledge. The law was discovered by Julius von  
Mayer in the 19th century. So the answer should be Julius von Mayer.                                                                                  
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I need to find the person who discovered the law of conservation of energy in classical mechanics. I will use the tool `wiki` to get the     
information.

pope_age_wiki = wiki(query="law of conservation of energy discoverer")                                                                                
print("Law of conservation of energy discoverer:", pope_age_wiki)                                                                                     
```

Okay, the user is asking who discovered the law of conservation of energy in classical mechanics. Previously, I tried using the `wiki` tool but got an
error because the tool wasn't allowed. Now, I need to find another way to answer this without using the `wiki` function.                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Since the `wiki` tool is not available, I should rely on my existing knowledge. The law of conservation of energy was first formulated by Julius von  
Mayer in the 19th century. However, I need to confirm if this is accurate.                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                      
In classical mechanics, the principle is part of the broader framework established by Newton. But the specific discovery is often attributed to Mayer.
Another possibility is that it was popularized by James Prescott Joule, but the exact discoverer might be Mayer.                                      
                                                                                                                                                      
Given that the previous attempt using `wiki` failed, I'll go with the most commonly accepted answer based on historical context. The answer should be 
Julius von Mayer.
