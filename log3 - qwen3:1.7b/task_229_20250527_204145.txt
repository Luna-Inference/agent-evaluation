Okay, the user is asking for the main ingredient in shawarma. I need to figure out how to find this information. Shawarma is a popular Middle Eastern dish, so the main          
ingredient is likely meat, probably lamb or beef. But I need to confirm.                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I should use a web search to find the most common ingredient. The tools available include web_search and visit_webpage. Let me perform a web search for "main ingredient  
in shawarma". The results might list the typical ingredients.                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Alternatively, maybe there's a specific recipe or a well-known source. Since the user wants the main ingredient, I need to find the most commonly mentioned one. Let me check the
search results.                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Once I get the information, I can extract the main ingredient and present it as the answer. If the search returns something like "lamb" or "beef", that's the answer. If there's 
a mention of other ingredients like tomatoes or spices, those might be secondary. But the main one is likely meat.

Okay, so the user is asking for the main ingredient in shawarma. From the web search results, I need to determine that. The search results mention that shawarma is typically    
made with marinated meat, and the meat can be beef, lamb, chicken, or a combination. The spices like cumin, coriander, and paprika are part of the seasoning, but the main       
ingredient is the meat itself.                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Even though the spices add flavor, they don't replace the meat. The core component is the meat. So, the answer should clearly state that the main ingredient is meat, specifying 
that it's often lamb or beef but can vary by region. The search results also mention that in some regions, it's chicken, but the main ingredient remains the meat.

Okay, so the user is asking for the main ingredient in shawarma. From the web search results, I need to determine that. The search results mention that shawarma is typically 
made with marinated meat, and the meat can be beef, lamb, chicken, or a combination. The spices like cumin, coriander, and paprika are part of the seasoning, but the main 
ingredient is the meat itself.

Even though the spices add flavor, they don't replace the meat. The core component is the meat. So, the answer should clearly state that the main ingredient is meat, specifying 
that it's often lamb or beef but can vary by region. The search results also mention that in some regions, it's chicken, but the main ingredient remains the meat.

I need to make sure the answer is accurate and concise. The user might be looking for a straightforward answer, so I'll highlight that the main ingredient is meat, which is 
marinated and cooked. The answer should avoid any confusion about the spices, as they are secondary.

Okay, so the user is asking for the main ingredient in shawarma. From the web search results, I need to determine that. The search results mention that shawarma is typically

ingredient is the meat itself.

Okay, so the user is asking for the main ingredient in shawarma. From the web search results, I need to determine that. The search results mention that shawarma is typically 
made with marinated meat, and the meat can be beef, lamb, chicken, or a combination. The spices like cumin, coriander, and paprika are part of the seasoning, but the main 
ingredient is the meat itself.

Even though the spices add flavor, they don't replace the meat. The core component is the meat. So, the answer should clearly state that the main ingredient is meat, specifying 
that it's often lamb or beef but can vary by region. The search results also mention that in some regions, it's chicken, but the main ingredient remains the meat.

I need to make sure the answer is accurate and concise. The user might be looking for a straightforward answer, so I'll highlight that the main ingredient is meat, which is 
marinated and cooked. The answer should avoid any confusion about the spices, as they are secondary.

The main ingredient in shawarma is **meat**, typically marinated and cooked on a spit. While regional variations may use different meats like lamb, beef, or chicken, the core

Okay, so the user is asking for the main ingredient in shawarma. From the web search results, I need to determine that. The search results mention that shawarma is typically    
made with marinated meat, and the meat can be beef, lamb, chicken, or a combination. The spices like cumin, coriander, and paprika are part of the seasoning, but the main       
ingredient is the meat itself.                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Even though the spices add flavor, they don't replace the meat. The core component is the meat. So, the answer should clearly state that the main ingredient is meat, specifying 
that it's often lamb or beef but can vary by region. The search results also mention that in some regions, it's chicken, but the main ingredient remains the meat.

Okay, so the user is asking for the main ingredient in shawarma. From the web search results, I need to determine that. The search results mention that shawarma is typically    
made with marinated meat, and the meat can be beef, lamb, chicken, or a combination. The spices like cumin, coriander, and paprika are part of the seasoning, but the main       
ingredient is the meat itself.                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Even though the spices add flavor, they don't replace the meat. The core component is the meat. So, the answer should clearly state that the main ingredient is meat, specifying 
that it's often lamb or beef but can vary by region. The search results also mention that in some regions, it's chicken, but the main ingredient remains the meat.
