Okay, the user is asking who wrote "Oliver Twist". I need to figure out the answer. From my knowledge, "Oliver Twist" is a novel written by Charles Dickens. But maybe I should  
verify this using the available tools.                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I'll check if there's a tool that can search for book authors. The tools available are web_search and visit_webpage. So I should use web_search with the query "Who wrote 
Oliver Twist?".                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll perform a web search to find the author. Then, I can extract the information from the search results. If the search returns the correct information, I can confirm that the 
author is Charles Dickens. If not, maybe I need to look into more details. But based on my existing knowledge, Dickens is the correct answer. However, to be thorough, I'll use  
the web_search tool to get the exact answer.
