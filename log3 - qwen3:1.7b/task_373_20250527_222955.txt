Okay, the user is asking for the main ingredient in draniki. First, I need to figure out what draniki is. From what I know, draniki is a type of      
traditional Russian dish. The name sounds familiar, maybe it's a variant of a specific recipe.                                                        
                                                                                                                                                      
Since I don't have access to a database or a tool that can directly look up recipes, I need to use my existing knowledge. Draniki is typically made   
with a mix of ingredients. The main one is probably the dough, which is often a combination of flour, water, and sometimes eggs. But I should verify. 
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the user might be referring to a specific recipe. For example, in some regions, draniki could be made with a particular type of flour.          
Alternatively, it might be a variation of a dish like pirozhki or a similar pastry. The main ingredient could be wheat flour, but I need to be sure.  
                                                                                                                                                      
Since I can't perform a web search here, I'll have to rely on my existing knowledge. The most common main ingredient in draniki is wheat flour, often 
combined with eggs and milk. However, sometimes it's made with a different type of flour, like potato or buckwheat. But the most traditional would be 
wheat flour.                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                      
I should check if there's a standard recipe. If I recall correctly, the main ingredient is usually wheat flour, and the rest is a mix of eggs and     
milk. So the answer would be wheat flour. But I should make sure there's no other common ingredient. Alternatively, maybe it's a mix of different     
components.                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                      
Another thought: in some versions, the dough is made with a specific type of flour, like all-purpose or bread flour. But the main ingredient is       
typically the flour. So the answer is wheat flour. However, I should confirm if there's a specific ingredient that's universally considered the main  
one.                                                                                                                                                  
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use my existing knowledge to determine the main ingredient in draniki. Draniki is a traditional Russian dish typically made with wheat
flour, eggs, and milk. The main ingredient is wheat flour.
