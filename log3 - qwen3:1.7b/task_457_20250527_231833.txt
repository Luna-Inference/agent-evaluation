<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking for the main ingredient in verivorst. First, I need to figure out what "verivorst" refers to. The word "verivorst" doesn't   
ring a bell immediately. Maybe it's a misspelling or a specific term.                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, "verivorst" could be a variation of "vermilion" or "vermox"? Alternatively, maybe it's a misspelling of "vermilion" or "vermox" which are types 
of dyes. Alternatively, "verivorst" might be a misspelling of "vermilion" or "vermox" which are colors.                                               
                                                                                                                                                      
Alternatively, considering that "verivorst" might be a misspelling of "vermilion" (a red dye) or "vermox" (a type of dye). But I need to verify.      
                                                                                                                                                      
Since the user is asking for the main ingredient, I should check if there's a known ingredient associated with "verivorst". If I can't recall, perhaps
I need to search for it.

Okay, so the user asked for the main ingredient in verivorst. From the web search results, I need to figure out what's the primary ingredient. Let me 
look through the results again.                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                      
The first result mentions pork blood, barley, onions, fatback, salt, pepper, marjoram. Then another source says it's made with pork blood, barley,    
onions, fatback, and spices. Another source says it's traditionally made with pork meat and blood, but there are vegetarian versions using plant-based
ingredients. The recipe details include 500g pork blood, 500g barley, onions, fatback, salt, pepper, marjoram.                                        
                                                                                                                                                      
So the main ingredients are pork blood and barley. But the question is about the main ingredient. Since pork blood is a key component, but barley is  
also present. However, in the context of traditional Estonian verivorst, pork blood is the primary ingredient. The other ingredients like barley and  
onions are added for flavor and texture. So the main ingredient would be pork blood. But I need to confirm if the answer expects the primary component
or the most common. The first result lists pork blood as the main ingredient. So the answer should be pork blood.
