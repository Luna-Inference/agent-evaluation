<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Cambodia. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools available. The tools mentioned are web_search, visit_webpage,
and final_answer. Since the user is looking for a straightforward answer, maybe a web search would work.                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I should use the web_search tool with the query "capital of Cambodia". The results from the search should give the answer. Once I get the result, I can extract the       
capital from the search results and then use the final_answer tool to provide the answer.                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the user might expect a direct answer. Let me check if the web_search returns the capital. If the search results include a statement like "The capital of Cambodia is Phnom
Penh," then I can take that as the answer. Otherwise, I need to parse the results. But since the tools are notional, I can assume that the web_search will return the correct    
information.                                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So the steps are: perform a web search for "capital of Cambodia", get the result, and then output the answer. Let me write the code for that.                                    
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the capital of Cambodia and then return the answer.
