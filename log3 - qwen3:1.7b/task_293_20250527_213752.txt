<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking who wrote "Great Expectations". Let me think about how to approach this.                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I know that "Great Expectations" is a novel by Charles Dickens. But maybe the user wants to confirm this through a search. Since the tools available include a web search 
function, I should use that to verify.                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I need to perform a web search for the book title "Great Expectations" to find the author. The tools provided are web_search and visit_webpage. So I'll use the web_search       
function with the query "Great Expectations author".                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the user might want the answer directly, so after getting the search results, I can parse the information. The search results should mention the author. Once I have that, 
I can use the final_answer tool to provide the answer.                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I should make sure to call the web_search function with the correct parameters. The query is "Great Expectations author", and the tool will return the top results. Then, I can  
check the first result and extract the author's name.                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Let me write the code to do that. First, perform the search, then process the result to get the author's name. Then, output the final answer.                                    
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the author of "Great Expectations" and then return the final answer.
