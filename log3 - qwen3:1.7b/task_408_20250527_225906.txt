<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Hungary. I need to find that out. Let me think about the tools I have.                                    
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I can use the web search tool to look up information about Hungary's capital. The web_search function can be used here. The query should be    
"capital of Hungary". Let me check the tools again. The web_search function takes a query string and returns the top results.                         
                                                                                                                                                      
I'll call web_search with the query "capital of Hungary". Then, I can parse the results to find the capital. But wait, the tools don't have a specific
function to extract the capital from the search results. So maybe the search result will directly give the answer.                                    
                                                                                                                                                      
Alternatively, if the search returns a list of websites, I can check the first one. But since the user hasn't provided specific tools for parsing the 
search results, I'll assume that the web_search function returns the answer directly.                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
So the code would be: call web_search with the query, then output the answer. Let me write that.                                                      
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the web search tool to find the capital of Hungary.
