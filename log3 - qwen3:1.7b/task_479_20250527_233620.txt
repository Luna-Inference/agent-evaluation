Okay, the user is asking for the most spoken language in the world. I need to figure out how to find that information. Let me think about the tools I 
have available.                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I remember that there are tools like web_search and visit_webpage. Maybe I can use web_search to look up the top languages by population. The  
user might expect the answer to be English, but I should verify that.                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the tools mentioned include web_search, which returns top search results. So I can perform a search for "most spoken language in the world" and 
get the top result. Then, I can parse that result to extract the language name.                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                      
But how to handle the search results? The example in the previous task shows that web_search returns a string, which might be the top result. So I can
use that string to find the answer.                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                      
Alternatively, maybe there's a specific database or list that's commonly referenced. For instance, the top languages by population are usually listed 
in sources like Ethnologue or the CIA World Factbook. But since I can't access external databases, relying on web_search is the way to go.            
                                                                                                                                                      
So the plan is: perform a web search for "most spoken language in the world", get the top result, and extract the language name from that result.     
Then, return that as the answer.                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                      
I need to write code that does this. Let's structure it step by step. First, use web_search with the query. Then, parse the result to find the        
language. Since the result is a string, I can look for keywords like "most spoken language" or "top language by population".                          
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, in the previous example, when the user asked about the pope's age, the code used the wiki tool. Here, maybe the web_search tool will return the 
top result directly. So the code would be something like:                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                      
result = web_search("most spoken language in the world")                                                                                              
print(result)                                                                                                                                         
Then, extract the language from the result. But how? The result might be a string like "English is the most spoken language in the world with         
approximately 417 million speakers." So I can split the string or use string manipulation to find the language name.                                  
                                                                                                                                                      
Alternatively, maybe the web_search returns a list of results, and the first one is the most relevant. But the example in the previous task shows that
web_search returns a single string, so perhaps the first result is the answer.                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                      
So the code would be:                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
result = web_search("most spoken language in the world")                                                                                              
answer = result.split("is")[1].split(" ")[0]                                                                                                          
final_answer(answer)                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                      
But I need to make sure that the split is correct. Alternatively, maybe the result is structured differently. For example, if the result is "English  
is the most spoken language in the world with approximately 417 million speakers.", then the language is "English".                                   
                                                                                                                                                      
So the code would be:                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
result = web_search("most spoken language in the world")                                                                                              
most_spoken_language = result.split("is")[1].split(" ")[0]                                                                                            
final_answer(most_spoken_language)                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                      
But I need to handle cases where the result might have different structures. However, given the constraints, this approach should work.               
                                                                                                                                                      
Another consideration: the answer might be "English" or "Chinese", but the most spoken is usually English. However, the exact answer might vary based 
on the search results. But the user is asking for the most spoken, so the answer is likely English.                                                   
                                                                                                                                                      
But to be precise, the code should extract the language from the search result. So the code would be as above.                                        
                                                                                                                                                      
Now, I need to write the code step by step, making sure to call the web_search tool first, then process the result.                                   
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will perform a web search to find the most spoken language in the world and extract the result.
