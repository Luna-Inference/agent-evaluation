<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking about the main language spoken in Egypt. Let me think about how to approach this.                                            
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I need to find out what languages are spoken there. The main one is Arabic, but maybe there are others. I should check reliable sources. Since 
I can use web search, I can perform a search for "main language in Egypt" to get the top results.                                                     
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the tools available include web_search and visit_webpage. So I can use web_search with the query "main language in Egypt". The results might    
mention Arabic as the primary language. Also, maybe some info about other languages like English, but the main one is likely Arabic.                  
                                                                                                                                                      
I should execute the search and then parse the results. But since the tools don't have a direct way to process the search results, I can just print   
the first result. If the search returns something like "Arabic is the primary language...", then the answer is Arabic. If there's more info, like     
other languages, but the question asks for the main one, so Arabic is the answer.                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                      
So the code would be to perform the web search and then output the answer based on the first result. Let me write that.                               
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the web search tool to find the main language spoken in Egypt and then return the answer based on the search results.             
Code:                                                                                                                                                 
```py                                                                                                                                                 
main_language = web_search(query="main language in Egypt")
