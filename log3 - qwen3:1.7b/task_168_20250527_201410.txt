Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Lithuania. Let me think about how to approach this.                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I know that the capital of Lithuania is Vilnius. But maybe I should verify this using a reliable source. Since the user might want an accurate answer, I should check a   
credible database or a trusted website.                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Looking at the tools available, there's a 'wiki' function that can be used to look up information. So I'll use that. The query would be "capital of Lithuania". Let me call the  
wiki function with that query.                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the tools mentioned include 'wiki' and 'web_search'. The 'wiki' function might return the correct information. Let me execute the code to get the answer.                  
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the wiki tool to find the capital of Lithuania.

Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Lithuania. I tried using the wiki tool earlier, but there was an error because the tool wasn't allowed. Let me think of another way  
to get the answer.                                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Since I can't use the wiki function, maybe I can recall general knowledge. I remember that Lithuania's capital is Vilnius. But to be sure, perhaps I can use a web search to     
confirm. Let me try the web_search tool with the query "capital of Lithuania".                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the previous attempt used a function that wasn't allowed. Now, I need to ensure I use allowed tools. The allowed tools include web_search and visit_webpage. So I'll use   
web_search to look up the answer.
