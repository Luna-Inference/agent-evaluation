Okay, the user is asking for the main ingredient in hummus. I need to figure out what the primary component is. Hummus is a popular dip made from legumes, usually chickpeas, and
other ingredients. But I should verify this.                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I should search for information about the main ingredients of hummus. Let me use the web_search tool to find the answer. The query should be straightforward, like "main  
ingredient in hummus".                                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Once I get the search results, I can analyze the information. The top result might mention that chickpeas are the main ingredient, along with olive oil, salt, and maybe other   
components. I need to confirm the primary ingredient.                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
If the search returns multiple sources, I should check the most reliable ones. For example, if one source says chickpeas are the main ingredient and another mentions other      
components, the primary one would be chickpeas.                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
After gathering the information, I can compile the answer. If the search results indicate that chickpeas are the main ingredient, then that's the answer. If there's mention of  
other ingredients, but chickpeas are the primary, then I'll state that.
