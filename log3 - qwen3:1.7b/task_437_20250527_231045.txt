Okay, the user is asking who wrote the book titled 'Agatha'. First, I need to figure out what 'Agatha' refers to. Since it's a book title, there might
be multiple possibilities. The most famous work with that title is "Agatha" by Agatha Christie, a British author. But I should verify if there are    
other possible authors.                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                      
I should start by searching for the book "Agatha" to find out its author. Using the web search tool, I can check the top results. The search will     
return information about the book, including the author. Once I have that information, I can confirm the author and provide the answer.               
                                                                                                                                                      
So, the steps are: perform a web search for "Agatha book author", extract the relevant information, and then return the author's name as the final    
answer.                                                                                                                                               
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the web search tool to find the author of the book titled 'Agatha' and then return the result.
