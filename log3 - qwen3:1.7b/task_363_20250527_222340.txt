<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Azerbaijan. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools available. The user mentioned using web search and visiting
webpages, so maybe I can use the web_search function.                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I should perform a web search for the capital of Azerbaijan. The query would be something like "capital of Azerbaijan". Then, I can retrieve the top results. The         
observation from the search would give me the answer. Once I have the capital, I can use the final_answer tool to present it.                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the tools are web_search and visit_webpage. So I'll call web_search with the query. Then, check the results. The answer should be something like Baku. Let me write the    
code accordingly.                                                                                                                                                                
</think>
