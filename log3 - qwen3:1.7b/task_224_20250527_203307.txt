Okay, the user is asking who discovered the electron. I need to find the answer using the tools provided. Let me think about the steps.                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I should use the web search tool to look up the discovery of the electron. The query should be straightforward. Maybe something like "who discovered the electron". Then, 
I can retrieve the results and extract the information.                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the tools available are web_search and visit_webpage. So I'll call web_search with the query. Once I get the results, I need to parse them to find the correct answer. The 
answer is likely the name of the scientist, perhaps J.J. Thomson.                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
But I have to make sure the results are accurate. If the search returns multiple sources, I should check the most reliable ones. Maybe the first result mentions J.J. Thomson.   
Let me write the code to perform the search and then extract the answer.                                                                                                         
</think>
