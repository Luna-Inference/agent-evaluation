<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking for the largest ocean on Earth. Let me think about how to approach this.                                                     
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I know that the Earth has four major oceans: Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, and Arctic. But the largest one is the Pacific Ocean. However, I should
verify this to make sure there's no confusion. Maybe there's a case where the Arctic Ocean is considered larger, but I remember that the Arctic is    
smaller in area compared to the Pacific.                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
I need to check the exact areas of these oceans. The Pacific Ocean is the largest, covering about 63.16 million square kilometers. The Atlantic is    
about 106.4 million square kilometers, the Indian about 29.06 million, and the Arctic about 14.56 million. So definitely, the Pacific is the largest. 
                                                                                                                                                      
But maybe the user wants the answer in a different way, like by name or something else. However, the question is straightforward. The answer should be
the name of the largest ocean, which is the Pacific Ocean.                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                      
I should use a tool to confirm this. Since the tools available include web search, maybe using the web_search function to look up the largest ocean.  
But since the user didn't specify any particular tools, and given the previous examples, perhaps the assistant can directly answer based on prior     
knowledge.                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the previous examples show that when the assistant uses tools like wiki or web_search, they process the results. But in this case, since the    
question is straightforward, maybe the assistant can directly answer without using any tools. However, the rules say to use tools when needed. But if 
the assistant has prior knowledge, they can proceed.                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                      
So, the answer is the Pacific Ocean. Therefore, the final answer should be "The largest ocean on Earth is the Pacific Ocean."

Thought: I will use the web_search tool to confirm the largest ocean on Earth.
