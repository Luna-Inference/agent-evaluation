Okay, the user is asking for the smallest country in the world by area. I need to figure out how to find that information.                            
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I remember that the smallest country by area is Vatican City. But I should confirm this. Maybe there's a way to check using the available      
tools. The tools provided are web_search and visit_webpage. So I can use web_search to look up the smallest country by area.                          
                                                                                                                                                      
I'll start by performing a web search for "smallest country by area". The result should give me the answer. Then, I can extract the information from  
the search results and provide the answer.

Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the smallest country by area and then extract the answer from the results.
