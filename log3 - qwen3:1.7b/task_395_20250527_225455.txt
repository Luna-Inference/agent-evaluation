<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking who wrote "Adam Bede" by Thomas Hardy. Let me think about how to approach this.                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I need to find the author of the novel "Adam Bede." Since I can use web search tools, I should perform a search to find the author. The tools  
available are web_search and visit_webpage. Let me use the web_search function with the query "Adam Bede author."                                     
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the user might want the answer directly, so I should execute the search and then retrieve the result. The code would be something like:         
                                                                                                                                                      
pope_age_wiki = wiki(query="current pope age")                                                                                                        
print("Pope age as per wikipedia:", pope_age_wiki)                                                                                                    
pope_age_search = web_search(query="current pope age")                                                                                                
print("Pope age as per google search:", pope_age_search)                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
But for this task, it's about "Adam Bede." So the code should be:                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                      
result = web_search("Adam Bede author")                                                                                                               
final_answer(result)                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                      
I need to make sure that the web_search returns the correct author. Since I can't be sure of the exact result, I'll proceed with the search. If the   
search returns the author, then the answer is ready. If not, maybe I need to check more sources, but according to the rules, I should only use the    
tools provided. So the code should be straightforward.                                                                                                
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the author of "Adam Bede."
