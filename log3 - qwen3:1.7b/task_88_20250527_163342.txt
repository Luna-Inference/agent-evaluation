<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Germany. I need to figure out how to get that information. Let me think about the tools available.        
                                                                                                                                                      
The tools mentioned are web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer. Since the user is asking for a factual answer, web_search might be the best      
approach. I can use the web_search function with the query "capital of Germany" to find the top result. Then, I can extract the capital from the      
search results.                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the tools don't have a specific function for getting the capital, but the web_search can return the top results. So I'll perform a web search   
for "capital of Germany" and then check the first result. The capital of Germany is Berlin, but I need to confirm via the search. Once I get the      
result, I can use the final_answer to provide the answer.
