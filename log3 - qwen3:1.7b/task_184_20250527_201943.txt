Okay, the user is asking for the chemical symbol of magnesium. I need to figure out how to get that information.                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I remember that magnesium is a chemical element. The symbol for magnesium is Mg. But maybe they want a more detailed answer, like the atomic number or the period it's in.
Wait, the question is just "what is the chemical symbol," so the answer is straightforward.                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
But since I can use the tools provided, maybe I should check a reliable source. The tools available are web_search and visit_webpage. So I can perform a web search to find the  
chemical symbol of magnesium.                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Let me structure the code. I'll use the web_search function with the query "chemical symbol for magnesium". Then, I'll retrieve the result and print it. The final answer will be
the extracted information.                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the user might expect the symbol Mg, but maybe the search returns more details. However, the question is simple, so the answer is Mg. But to be thorough, using the tool to
confirm would be better. Let me proceed with the code.                                                                                                                           
</think>

[Magnesium - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium)
Magnesium is a chemical element; it has symbol Mg and atomic number 12. It is a shiny gray metal having a low density, low melting point and high chemical reactivity. Like the 
other alkaline earth metals (group 2 of the periodic table), it occurs naturally only in combination with other elements and almost always has an oxidation state of +2.

[Magnesium | Mg | CID 5462224 - PubChem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/magnesium)
Magnesium is important for many biochemical processes and is therefore quite common in humans. The majority of magnesium is stored in the bones (>50%), while the remainder is 
stored in muscle, soft tissue, red blood cells and serum. This is functionally important since the bones behave as a magnesium exchange reservoir and help maintain healthy 
levels of magnesium.

compounds known with magnesium-magnesium bonds, LMg―MgL, in which the magnesium centres have a formal +1 oxidation state. Magnesium carbonate, MgCO 3, occurs in nature as the 
mineral magnesite and is an important ...
