<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking who wrote "The Picture of Dorian Gray." Let me think about how to approach this.                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I need to find out the author of this famous novel. The title reminds me of Oscar Wilde's work. But maybe I should verify this. The user might want a definitive answer,  
so I should check if there's any other possible author or if this is indeed Wilde's work.                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Since I can use web search tools, I'll perform a search to confirm the author. The tools available include web_search and visit_webpage. I'll use web_search with the query "Who 
wrote The Picture of Dorian Gray?" to get the top results.                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Once I get the answer, I can check if it's Oscar Wilde. If the search returns that he is the author, then I can provide that as the final answer. If there's any uncertainty, I  
might need to look into more sources, but given the context, it's likely Wilde.
