<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Finland. I need to find that out. Let me think about the tools I have.                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Hmm, the available tools are web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer. Since the question is straightforward, maybe a web search would work. I can use the web_search function
with the query "capital of Finland". Let me check if there's any need to visit a specific webpage. Probably not, since a general search should suffice.                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the user might expect a direct answer. But according to the rules, I have to use the tools provided. So I'll perform a web search. The code would be something like        
web_search("capital of Finland") and then retrieve the result. Then, using the final_answer tool to present the answer.                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I should make sure the code is correct. Let me structure it step by step. First, call web_search with the right query, then process the result and final answer. Alright, that's 
the plan.                                                                                                                                                                        
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the capital of Finland.
