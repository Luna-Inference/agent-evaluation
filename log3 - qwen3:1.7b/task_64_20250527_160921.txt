<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, let's tackle the question: "Who is known as the 'Maid of Orléans'?"                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I need to figure out what the 'Maid of Orléans' refers to. From my knowledge, the Maid of Orléans is a historical figure, likely a woman from  
the 12th century. She's associated with the French monarchy and the Hundred Years' War. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact details.            
                                                                                                                                                      
Since the task is to find out who she is, I should use the available tools. The tools include web search and possibly other functions. The user       
mentioned using the `web_search` function, which is available. So, I'll perform a web search to find information about the Maid of Orléans.           
                                                                                                                                                      
I'll use the `web_search` function with the query "Maid of Orléans" to get the relevant results. Then, I can analyze the search results to determine  
the answer. If the search returns the correct information, I can extract the name and details from the results.                                       
                                                                                                                                                      
I need to make sure that the search is accurate. The query should be straightforward. The results might include historical records, biographies, or   
articles about the Maid of Orléans. Once I have the information, I can present the answer using the `final_answer` tool.
