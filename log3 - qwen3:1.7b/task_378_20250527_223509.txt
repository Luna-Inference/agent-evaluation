Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Moldova. Let me think about how to approach this.                                                         
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I know that Moldova is a country in Europe, and its capital is Vladivostok. But wait, is that correct? Wait, no, Vladivostok is in Russia.     
Wait, Moldova's capital is Chisinau. Let me confirm that. Oh, right, Chisinau is the capital of Moldova. But I should verify this using a reliable    
source.                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                      
Since I can use web search tools, I should perform a search to confirm the capital of Moldova. Let me use the web_search function with the query      
"capital of Moldova". The tool will return the top results. Then I can extract the capital from the search results.                                   
                                                                                                                                                      
So the steps are: perform a web search for the capital of Moldova, retrieve the result, and then return that as the answer.
