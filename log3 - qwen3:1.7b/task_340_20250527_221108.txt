Okay, the user is asking for the chemical symbol of ruthenium. Let me think about how to approach this.                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I know that chemical symbols are usually abbreviations of the element's name. Ruthenium is a transition metal, and its symbol is Ru. But I should verify this to make     
sure. Maybe I can use a web search to confirm the symbol. The tool 'web_search' can be used here. Let me perform a search for "chemical symbol of ruthenium" to get the correct  
answer. Once I get the result, I can extract the symbol and provide it as the final answer.                                                                                      
</think>
