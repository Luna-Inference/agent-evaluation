<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking who the first woman in space was. I need to figure out how to find that information. Let's think about the tools available.  
The previous examples used web searches and tools like wiki and search. So maybe I should use a web search here.                                      
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I should perform a search to find the answer. The query should be something like "first woman in space". Then, I can retrieve the result and   
extract the information. Since the tools allow for web searches, I can use the web_search function.                                                   
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the user's task is to answer the question, so I need to make sure the search is accurate. Let me check the tools again. The web_search function 
takes a query string and returns the top results. So I'll call web_search with the query "first woman in space".                                      
                                                                                                                                                      
Once I get the results, I need to parse them to find the answer. The observation will give me the top result, which should mention the name. Then, I  
can use the final_answer tool to present the answer.                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                      
I should also consider if there are any other tools, but given the previous examples, web_search is the way to go. Let me write the code to perform   
the search and then extract the answer.                                                                                                               
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the answer about the first woman in space.
