<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Tajikistan. I need to figure out how to find that information. Let me think about the tools available.                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Hmm, the user mentioned using the tools provided, which include web search and visiting webpages. So maybe I should use the web_search function to look up the capital of        
Tajikistan. The tools are web_search and visit_webpage, which I can use to get the information.                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I should perform a web search for "capital of Tajikistan". The search results will give me the answer. Once I get the results, I can extract the capital from the top     
result.                                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the user's previous examples show that when they need to retrieve information, they use the search tool and then process the results. So in this case, I'll use web_search 
with the query "capital of Tajikistan". Then, I'll check the results to find the capital.                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I need to make sure that the code is correct. The code should call web_search with the right parameters. Let me structure the code: call web_search with the query, then process 
the result to get the capital.                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I should also check if there are any other steps needed, like verifying the information from multiple sources. But since the user's task is straightforward, just getting the    
capital from the search result should suffice.                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So the code will be something like:                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
web_search("capital of Tajikistan")                                                                                                                                              
Then, extract the capital from the first result. But how to do that? The tools might return a string, so I can split the string or find the part that mentions the capital.      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Alternatively, maybe the web_search function returns the answer directly. If the search returns the capital as the first part of the result, then I can just take that.          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Once I have the answer, I can use the final_answer function to provide the result.                                                                                               
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the capital of Tajikistan and then return the result.
