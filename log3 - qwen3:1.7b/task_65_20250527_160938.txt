Okay, the user is asking for the chemical symbol of silver. I need to figure out what that is. From what I remember, silver is a metal used in various
applications, like coins and jewelry. The chemical symbol for silver is Ag. But wait, maybe I should verify this to be sure. Let me check if there's a
more accurate way to find it.                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                      
Hmm, the user might expect a more precise answer. Maybe using a tool to look it up would be better. But the available tools are web_search and        
visit_webpage. So I can perform a web search for "chemical symbol for silver" to get the correct answer. Let me do that.                              
                                                                                                                                                      
I'll use the web_search function with the query "chemical symbol for silver". Then, the result should give the correct symbol. Once I get the answer, 
I can present it to the user.
