<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking for the current distance from Earth to the Moon. I need to find that value. Let me think about the tools available.          
                                                                                                                                                      
The available tools are web_search and visit_webpage. So I can use web_search with the query "distance from Earth to the Moon". The previous examples 
show that when you perform a web search, it returns the top results. I should check the first result to get the distance.                             
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the user might want the latest data. The answer could be from a reliable source like NASA. Let me perform the search and then extract the       
distance from the first result.                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                      
So the code would be: call web_search with the query, then parse the first result to find the distance. Then return that value.                       
</think>

[How far is the moon from Earth? | Space](https://www.space.com/18145-how-far-is-the-moon.html)
Learn about the average, shortest and greatest distances between the moon and Earth, and how they affect tides and eclipses. Find out how long it 
takes to get to the moon and how it is drifting away from Earth over time.

[Lunar distance - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_distance)
The instantaneous Earth-Moon distance, or distance to the Moon, is the distance from the center of Earth to the center of the Moon. In contrast, the 
Lunar distance (LD or ), or Earth-Moon characteristic distance, is a unit of measure in astronomy. More technically, it is the semi-major axis of the 
geocentric lunar orbit.

[How Far Away Is the Moon? - NASA Space Place](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/moon-distance/en/)
Learn the average and minimum/maximum distances of the Moon from Earth, and how to compare them with Earth's size. Find out why the Moon looks close 
but is actually far away, and try an activity to see for yourself.

[Moon Distance Calculator - How Close is Moon to Earth?](https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/moon/distance.html)
The Moon Distance Calculator shows approximate times for when the Moon is closest to the Earth (perigee) and furthest from the Earth (apogee).

[How far away is the Moon? - Royal Museums Greenwich](https://www.rmg.co.uk/stories/space-astronomy/how-far-away-moon)
The average distance between the Earth and the Moon is 384 400 km (238 855 miles). How far is that in light-seconds? Light travels at 300,000 
kilometres per second, so it takes about 1.3 seconds for light to travel from the Moon back to the Earth. In other words, the Moon is 1.3 
light-seconds away from the Earth.

is drifting away from us and what would happen if it disappeared.

[How Far Is The Moon From Earth? - WorldAtlas](https://www.worldatlas.com/space/how-far-is-the-moon-from-earth.html)
The moon's distance from the Earth changes over its orbit, ranging from 226,000 to 251,000 miles. Learn how this affects tides, super moons and solar 
eclipses.

[How far away is the moon? - Live Science](https://www.livescience.com/space/the-moon/how-far-away-is-the-moon)
The moon's distance from Earth varies from 221,500 to 252,000 miles, depending on its orbit. Learn how scientists measure the moon's distance and why 
it matters for space missions.

[How far is the Moon from Earth? - Geographic Pedia - NCESC](https://www.ncesc.com/geographic-pedia/how-far-is-the-moon-from-earth/)
The Moon's Dynamic Distance The Moon's elliptical orbit means that at its closest point to Earth, known as perigee, it is around 363,300 km (226,000 
miles) away. Conversely, at its farthest point, called apogee, the Moon is approximately 405,500 km (251,000 miles) from Earth. This variation of 
about 42,200 km (25,000 miles) might not seem like much on a cosmic scale, but it does impact the ...

<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, so the user asked for the distance from Earth to the Moon. I used the web_search tool with the query "distance from Earth to the Moon". The     
results from the search include various sources. The NASA Space Place link mentions the average distance as 384,400 km. Another source, the World     
Atlas, states it ranges from 226,000 to 251,000 miles. But the user probably wants the average value.                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
Looking at the search results, the NASA link explicitly states the average distance. The other links talk about variations but don't give a specific  
number. So the correct answer is the average distance of 384,400 km. I need to confirm this value and present it as the final answer.

Thought: The web search returned the average distance from Earth to the Moon as 384,400 km. I will extract this value and present it as the final
