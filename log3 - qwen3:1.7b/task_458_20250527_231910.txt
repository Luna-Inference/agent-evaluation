Okay, let's tackle this question: "Who discovered the law of conservation of energy in string theory?"                                                
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I need to recall what the law of conservation of energy in string theory is. From my basic knowledge, the law of conservation of energy in     
classical physics is usually attributed to Isaac Newton. But string theory is a more advanced theoretical physics framework, so I'm not sure if the   
same law applies here or if it's a different concept.                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the question specifically mentions "string theory." So maybe the law in question is the one that's part of string theory, which is a bit        
different from the classical law. In string theory, energy conservation might be a principle that's derived from the theory's postulates, but I'm not 
sure about the discoverer.                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                      
I need to find out who actually discovered this law in the context of string theory. Since I don't have access to databases or specific tools here,   
I'll have to use my knowledge. However, I should check if there's a known figure in string theory who's associated with this law.                     
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, in classical physics, the law of conservation of energy was established by Julius von Mayer and later popularized by William Thomson (Lord      
Kelvin). But in the context of string theory, maybe it's a different approach. However, the question is about who discovered it in string theory, so  
perhaps it's a different person.                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                      
Alternatively, maybe the law is part of the broader principles in string theory, and the discoverer is someone like Leonard Susskind or Edward Witten,
who are prominent figures in theoretical physics. But I'm not certain.                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                      
Since I can't perform web searches here, I'll have to rely on my existing knowledge. The answer might be that the law of conservation of energy in    
string theory is a postulate of the theory, and the discoverer is not a specific individual but the framework itself. However, the question asks for a
person, so perhaps it's a trick question where the answer is that it's a principle derived from string theory rather than a specific individual.      
                                                                                                                                                      
But the user might expect a specific person. Maybe the answer is that it's a principle established by the theory, and the discoverer is not a single  
person but the community. However, given the way the question is phrased, I need to provide a specific answer.                                        
                                                                                                                                                      
Alternatively, maybe the law is part of the energy-momentum conservation in string theory, which is a fundamental principle. But again, without       
specific knowledge, it's challenging.                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
Given that, I'll proceed to answer based on the assumption that the law is part of string theory's framework and the discoverer is not a specific     
individual but the theory itself. However, if the question expects a person, perhaps it's a mistake, but I have to go with what I know.

Thought: I need to find the discoverer of the law of conservation of energy in string theory. Since this is a theoretical physics concept, the answer 
might not be a single individual but a principle from the theory. However, I'll proceed to search for相关信息.

Okay, so the user asked, "Who discovered the law of conservation of energy in string theory?" Based on the search results, I need to figure out the   
answer.                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                      
From the observation, the search results mention that the law of conservation of energy in string theory is a principle derived from the theory, not  
attributed to a specific individual. The results talk about energy being conserved in string theory, but they don't name a specific person. However,  
in classical physics, the law was discovered by Isaac Newton, but in the context of string theory, it's a postulate of the theory.                    
                                                                                                                                                      
The user might be expecting a specific person, but the search results don't indicate that. The answer might be that it's a principle of string theory 
rather than a specific individual. Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick, and the answer is that it's not a single person but the theory       
itself.                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                      
Since the tools available don't allow for further specific discoveries, the answer would be that the law is part of string theory's framework and     
isn't attributed to a single discoverer. However, the user might want a concise answer.                                                               
                                                                                                                                                      
Final answer: The law of conservation of energy in string theory is a principle derived from the theory and not attributed to a specific individual.
