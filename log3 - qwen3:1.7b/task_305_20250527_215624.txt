<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, let's see. The user is asking who wrote "The Hunchback of Notre-Dame." I need to figure out the answer. First, I should recall if I know this information. From what I     
remember, "The Hunchback of Notre-Dame" is a novel written by Victor Hugo. But maybe I should verify this using the available tools.                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The tools available are web_search and visit_webpage. So I can use web_search to look up the author of the book. The query should be something like "Who wrote The Hunchback of  
Notre-Dame?"                                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll start by performing a web search with that query. The result should give me the author's name. Once I get the answer, I can confirm it and then present the final answer.   
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the `web_search` tool to find the author of "The Hunchback of Notre-Dame."
