<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, let's see. The user is asking who wrote "Scenes of Clerical Life". First, I need to figure out if I have access to any tools that can help me   
find this information. The available tools are web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer.                                                           
                                                                                                                                                      
Hmm, the web_search tool can be used to look up the book. So I should use that. The query would be "Who wrote Scenes of Clerical Life?". I'll run the 
web search to get the results. Then, based on the search results, I can determine the author.                                                         
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, but the user might expect me to use the tools step by step. Let me structure the code. First, call web_search with the query. Then, process the 
results to find the author. If the search returns the author's name, I can use final_answer to present it. If not, maybe I need to check more sources.
But according to the rules, I should only use the tools provided and not chain too many steps. So I'll do the web search first, then check the        
results.                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
I need to make sure the code is correct. The code should be something like:                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                      
web_search(query="Who wrote Scenes of Clerical Life?")                                                                                                
print("Result: ...")                                                                                                                                  
final_answer(result)                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                      
But since the web_search returns a string, I need to parse it to find the author. However, the tools don't specify how the search results are         
structured. So I'll assume that the search result contains the author's name directly. If not, maybe there's a need to visit a specific webpage, but  
the user hasn't provided that info. So proceed with the web_search and check the output.                                                              
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the `web_search` tool to find the author of "Scenes of Clerical Life" and then return the final answer based on the search        
results.
