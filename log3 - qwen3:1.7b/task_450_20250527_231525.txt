Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Iceland. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have.                            
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I can use the web search tool to look up the capital of Iceland. The web_search function would be appropriate here. The query should be        
"capital of Iceland". Let me check if there's any need for translation or additional steps. The user didn't specify any particular language, so I'll  
just use the default.                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
I'll call the web_search function with the query. Then, I'll process the result to extract the capital. The result from the search should give the    
answer directly. Once I have the capital, I can present it as the final answer.
