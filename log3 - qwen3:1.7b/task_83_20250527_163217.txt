<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Mexico. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have available. There's the wiki  
tool, which can be used to look up information. Also, there's a web search tool that can retrieve current information.                                
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I should use the wiki tool to get the capital of Mexico. The wiki query would be something like "capital of Mexico". Let me check if that's    
straightforward. If the wiki returns the correct information, I can use that. If not, maybe the web search tool is needed.                            
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the user's task is to provide the answer, so I need to make sure the information is accurate. Let me start by calling the wiki function with the
query "capital of Mexico". If the result is something like "Mexico City is the capital of Mexico.", then that's the answer. If there's a different    
result, maybe the web search is better. But since the wiki tool is available, I'll try that first.                                                    
                                                                                                                                                      
I should also consider if there are any other tools, but the user hasn't mentioned any specific ones. The available tools are wiki and web_search. So,
I'll proceed with the wiki tool first.                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                      
Once I get the result from the wiki, I can print it and then use the final_answer tool to provide the answer. Let me write the code for that.         
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the `wiki` tool to find the capital of Mexico.

Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Mexico. Earlier, I tried using the wiki tool but got an error because the function wasn't allowed. Now I

City is the capital. Even though the search results are a bit scattered, the key information is clear. The capital of Mexico is Mexico City. I need to
make sure to extract that answer from the search results. Since the web search returned the necessary information, I can now provide the final answer.
