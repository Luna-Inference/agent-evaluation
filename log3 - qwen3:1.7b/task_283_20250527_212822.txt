<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the main ingredient in spring rolls. I need to figure out what that is. Spring rolls are a type of food, usually made with a wrapper, and the       
filling inside. The main ingredient would be the filling, which is typically a combination of vegetables, meat, or other ingredients.                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
But wait, maybe the question is more specific. Sometimes, spring rolls can have different variations. For example, they can be filled with vegetables like cabbage, carrots, or  
lettuce, or with meat like pork or chicken. Alternatively, some recipes might use tofu or other plant-based ingredients.                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Since the user is asking for the main ingredient, I should determine the most common or primary component. In many traditional spring rolls, the main ingredient is the          
vegetables, especially cabbage, because it's a common and affordable ingredient. However, sometimes the filling might be meat-based.                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I need to check if there's a standard answer. But since I can't perform real-time searches, I have to rely on my existing knowledge. From what I remember, the main ingredient in
spring rolls is usually the vegetables, especially cabbage, as they are the primary filling. However, some recipes might use meat, but the vegetable-based version is more       
common.                                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So, the answer is likely vegetables, specifically cabbage. But I should confirm if there's a more specific ingredient. Alternatively, maybe the main ingredient is the wrapper,  
but that's not an ingredient in the filling. The wrapper is usually a thin sheet of rice paper or flour, but that's not considered an ingredient in the filling.                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Therefore, the main ingredient in spring rolls is the filling, which is typically vegetables. But since the question is about the main ingredient, maybe the answer is cabbage.  
However, I should check if there's a standard answer. In many cases, the main ingredient is the vegetables, so the answer would be vegetables, but specifically cabbage.

Thought: I need to determine the main ingredient in spring rolls. Spring rolls typically have a vegetable filling, with cabbage being a common main ingredient. However, to      
confirm, I'll use the web search tool to verify the standard answer.
