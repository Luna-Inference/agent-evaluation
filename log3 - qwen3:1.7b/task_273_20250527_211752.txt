<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Thailand. I need to find that out. Let me think about the tools I have.                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Hmm, the available tools are web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer. So maybe I can use web_search with the query "capital of Thailand" to get the information.             
Alternatively, maybe the wiki tool could help, but the user didn't mention a wiki tool. Let me check the rules again.                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The rules say to use the tools provided. The web_search function is available. So I'll use that. The code would be something like web_search("capital of Thailand") and then     
print the result. Then, the final_answer would take that result.                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, in the previous examples, when they used web_search, they printed the results. So I need to make sure the code is structured correctly. Let me write the code step by step.
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, perform the web search for the capital of Thailand. Then, extract the answer from the search results. Then, use final_answer to present the answer.                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I should check if there's any need to visit a specific webpage, but since the user didn't specify, just a general search should work. So the code would be:                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
web_search("capital of Thailand")                                                                                                                                                
print("The capital of Thailand is ...")                                                                                                                                          
final_answer("Bangkok")                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
But I need to make sure the web_search returns the correct information. If the search returns the capital, then the answer is straightforward. If not, maybe I need to adjust the
query. But given that the user is asking a straightforward question, the web_search should return the correct answer.                                                            
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the capital of Thailand.
