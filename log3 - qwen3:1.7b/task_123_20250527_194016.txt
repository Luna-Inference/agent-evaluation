<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Ireland. Let me think about how to approach this.                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I know that the capital of Ireland is Dublin. But maybe I should verify this using a reliable source. Since the user might want an accurate answer, I should use a web    
search to confirm. The tools available include web_search, so I'll use that.                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll perform a web search for "capital of Ireland" to get the latest information. Then, I can retrieve the result and present it as the answer. Let me write the code for that.
