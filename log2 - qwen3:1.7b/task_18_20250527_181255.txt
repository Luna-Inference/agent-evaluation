Okay, the user is asking who discovered penicillin. I need to find the answer     
using the tools available. Let me think about the tools. The tools mentioned are  
web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer. Since the question is about a        
historical figure, a web search would be appropriate.                             
                                                                                  
First, I should use the web_search tool with the query "who discovered            
penicillin". The result will give me the answer. Once I get the information, I can
then use the final_answer tool to present the result.                             
                                                                                  
I need to make sure that the search is accurate. The answer is likely to be a     
well-known figure, maybe Alexander Fleming. But to be sure, I should perform the  
search. Let me execute the code now.                                              
</think>                                                                          
                                                                                  
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the answer to the question about  
who discovered penicillin.
