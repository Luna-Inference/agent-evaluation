<think>User's request: "Explain the process of cellular respiration and its three main stages." We need to produce an answer that explains
the process of cellular respiration and its three main stages.                                                                            
                                                                                                                                          
We are not allowed to output code block? Actually instructions says: Provide a final answer using a Python code snippet, but we must      
follow rules from chain-of-thought. Let me re-read user's request carefully: "Explain the process of cellular respiration and its three   
main stages." The answer should be explanation in text.                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                          
I need to produce answer as code block with Python code blocks with tool calls? But instructions say: Provide a final answer using tool   
final_answer() function maybe. But the rules require that I use only variables defined earlier, etc. But then it instructs me "explain the
process of cellular respiration and its three main stages." So answer is text.                                                            
                                                                                                                                          
I must produce chain-of-thought as explained:                                                                                             
- Steps: Write chain-of-thought (thought sequence) including final code snippet.                                                          
- Use Python code with triple backticks as instructions require, but not to chain multiple tool calls. I can just output a final answer by
calling final_answer("text answer").                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                          
So we need to produce final answer text that explains the process of cellular respiration and its three main stages: glycolysis, citric   
acid cycle (Krebs cycle) and oxidative phosphorylation (electron transport chain).                                                        
                                                                                                                                          
Let's produce final answer in steps:                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                          
I'll produce chain-of-thought as explanation.                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                          
Chain-of-thought:                                                                                                                         
We are given request: "Explain the process of cellular respiration and its three main stages." I need to recall that cellular respiration 
is a metabolic process by which cells convert biochemical energy from nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), releasing waste        
products. It consists mainly of three stages:                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                          
1. Glycolysis: Occurs in cytosol, splits glucose into two molecules of pyruvate, produces net 2 ATP and 2 NADH.                           
2. Citric Acid Cycle/Krebs Cycle: Occurs in mitochondrial matrix. Pyruvate is converted to acetyl-CoA which enters the Krebs cycle. Each  
turn generates CO2, NADH, FADH2, and GTP/ATP.                                                                                             
3. Oxidative Phosphorylation (Electron Transport Chain): Occurs on inner mitochondrial membrane. Electrons from NADH and FADH2 pass       
through complexes I-IV; proton gradient drives ATP synthase production of ATP; oxygen is final electron acceptor forming water.           
                                                                                                                                          
Thus answer: "Cellular respiration is the process that converts biochemical energy into ATP, using glycolysis, Krebs cycle and oxidative  
phosphorylation as main stages."                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                          
I can produce final code snippet like:                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                          
```                                                                                                                                       
final_answer("text answer")                                                                                                               
```                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                          
I must also include chain-of-thought text. However instructions say: Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence with chain-of-thought and then a
'Code:' block ending with triple backticks `
