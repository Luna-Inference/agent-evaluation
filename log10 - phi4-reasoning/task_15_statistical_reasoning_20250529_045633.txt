<think>We are asked: "Given a normal distribution with μ=100 and σ=15, what percentage of values fall between 85 and 130?" We want to     
answer. Let's compute the Z-scores for x = 85 and x = 130.                                                                                
                                                                                                                                          
For x=85: z = (85 - 100) / 15 = (-15)/15 = -1.                                                                                            
For x=130: z = (130-100)/15 = (30)/15 = +2.                                                                                               
Therefore we want the probability P(-1 < Z < 2). Use standard normal distribution.                                                        
                                                                                                                                          
The cumulative probability for z=-1 is around 0.1587, and for z=+2 is about 0.9772 approximately.                                         
Then difference: 0.9772 - 0.1587 = 0.8185 or 81.85% approximately.                                                                        
                                                                                                                                          
But let's re-check: Standard normal table:                                                                                                
z=2 => 0.9772                                                                                                                             
z=-1 => ~0.1587,                                                                                                                          
difference = .8185, equals 81.85%.                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                          
I want to check if it's exactly that? Yes.                                                                                                
Thus answer is approximately 81.8% values.                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                          
But I need code block with Python code and then final_answer function call.                                                               
                                                                                                                                          
Plan: Use math module maybe for computing cumulative distribution function of normal distribution. But note that our allowed functions    
from python are: we can import modules such as "statistics", "math". However, there's no builtin cdf in math library in standard python.  
I'd use perhaps integration approximations or use SciPy. But instructions said only imports allowed: math, re, stat etc. There is no scipy
module in allowed list; however "collections, datetime, itertools, math, queue, random, re, stat, statistics, time, unicodedata". None of 
these includes a cdf for normal distribution.                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                          
I need to compute the cumulative probability manually from z table approximations? Alternatively, I can use an approximation function:    
using error function. Python's math module has erfc and erf sometimes. Actually math.erf is available in python3.2 onward if we import    
math. But allowed modules are "math" is permitted.                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                          
We want to compute the cumulative distribution function for a given z score. The formula: phi(z) = 0.5*(1 + erf( z/sqrt(2))). Yes, so I'll
use math.erf from math module.                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                          
I can define function normal_cdf(x, mean=0, std=1): returns probability that variable is <= x in a standard normal distribution. But our  
given μ=100 and σ=15, so we need to transform: z = (x - 100)/15.                                                                          
                                                                                                                                          
So then answer is: P(85<=X<=130) = phi((130-100)/15) - phi((85-100)/15)=phi(2)-phi(-1).                                                   
                                                                                                                                          
We compute using math.erf. Use: math.sqrt(2)                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                          
phi(z) = 0.5*(1+math.erf(z/math.sqrt(2))).                                                                                                
Thus compute:                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                          
z_low = (85 - 100)/15 = -15/15 = -1,                                                                                                      
z_high = (130-100)/15 = 30/15= 2.                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                          
Then phi(2)=0.5*(1+erf(2/sqrt(2))) and phi(-1)=0.5*(1+erf(-1/sqrt(2))). But note that erf is odd, so erf(-x)=-erf(x). So phi(-1)=         
0.5*(1-erf(1/sqrt(2))).                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                          
Let's compute approximate values:                                                                                                         
erf(2/√2) = erf(2/1.41421356) = erf(1.41421356). And erf(1.41421356) is approximately 0.9545? Actually, standard value: erf(1.414)=0.9545 
maybe.                                                                                                                                    
Then phi(2)=0.5*(1+0.9545)=0.5*1.9545=0.97725.                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                          
For phi(-1)=0.5*(1 - erf(1/√2)) where 1/sqrt(2)=0.70710678, and erf(0.7071) is approximately 0.682689? Actually standard value:           
erf(0.7071)=0.682689. Then phi(-1)=0.5*(1-0.682689)=0.1586555.                                                                            
                                                                                                                                          
Difference = 0.97725 - 0.15866 = 0.81859, ~81.86%.                                                                                        
I'll round to 82% or mention "Approximately 81.9%" maybe.                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                          
I'll then return final_answer(percentage) using the final_answer function.                                                                
                                                                                                                                          
Plan: I can do something like:                                                                                                            
import math                                                                                                                               
def normal_cdf(x):                                                                                                                        
   return 0.5*(1 + math.erf((x-100)/ (15*math.sqrt(2))))                                                                                  
But careful: Actually formula: phi(x)=0.5*(1+erf((x-mean)/(std*sqrt(2)))). So code: def normal_cdf(x, mean=100, std=15): return 0.5*(1 +  
math.erf((x - mean) / (std*math.sqrt(2))))                                                                                                
But then compute for x=85 and x=130.                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                          
Alternatively, we can define a function "normal_pdf" but not needed.                                                                      
                                                                                                                                          
So I'll do:                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                          
import math

    return 0.5*(1+math.erf((x - mean)/(std*math.sqrt(2))))                                                                                
                                                                                                                                          
lower = normal_cdf(85)

percentage = (upper - lower) * 100                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                          
Then final_answer(percentage)                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                          
I'll produce the code accordingly.                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                          
I need to produce two sequences: Thought and Code. I must produce a code block with "```py" then code, then end code tag.                 
                                                                                                                                          
Thus answer:                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                          
I want to output final_answer(percentage)                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                          
Also mention that the percentage is approximately 81.9%.                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                          
Thus code snippet as follows.                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                          
I'll produce code block:

I'll produce code block accordingly. It's safe.                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                          
But wait, I must be careful: The instructions say "Use only variables that you have defined". And I've created lower_bound and upper_bound
then final_answer as function call with string.                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                          
Thus I'll do final answer.

I'll produce "```py" start code snippet. Then end code snippet.

I'll produce final answer.                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                          
I'll produce answer: Approximately 81.86% ~ 82%. So final answer is approximately "Approximately 81.86% of the values fall between 85 and 
130." That is acceptable.                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                          
I must produce code block with "```py" then code, then end "```
