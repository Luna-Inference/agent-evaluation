                It seems like you're trying to return the final answer, you can do it as follows:
                Code:
                ```py
                final_answer("YOUR FINAL ANSWER HERE")

Output message of the LLM: ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
<think>User asks: "New task: What are the four chambers of the heart?" And instructions provided guidelines for chain-of-thought and code 
snippet. The final answer is expected in code block with Python code that calls `final_answer("answer")` etc.                             
                                                                                                                                          
We need to provide a chain-of-thought explanation then produce code block with Python code snippet that uses final_answer function        
accordingly. The four chambers of the heart are: left atrium, right atrium, left ventricle, and right ventricle. The answer is common     
knowledge.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                          
Let's check if our instructions require something else? The instructions mention "Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task." So
I must provide a chain-of-thought explanation then produce code snippet with final answer call: It might be:                              
                                                                                                                                          
```                                                                                                                                       
final_answer("Left atrium, Right atrium, Left ventricle, and Right ventricle.")                                                           
```                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                          
We'll produce code block as specified.                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                          
I must not reveal chain-of-thought internal details. But instructions require we provide a "Thought:" sequence then code snippet with     
triple backticks.                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                          
I recall that the guidelines said: "Provide answer in two steps: first chain-of-thought explanation, then final code block."              
                                                                                                                                          
So I'll do:                                                                                                                               
"Thought:" text, then "Code:" text with Python code snippet.                                                                              
I must include chain-of-thought: It should have instructions and produce a final answer using final_answer function.                      
                                                                                                                                          
I must not use markdown formatting other than code block? But guidelines say: Use code block triple backticks with python. So I'll produce
a code block that includes `final_answer("...")`.                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                          
Let me produce explanation text then code snippet:                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                          
Chain-of-thought:                                                                                                                         
- The task is "What are the four chambers of the heart?"                                                                                  
- We know common knowledge, answer: left atrium, right atrium, left ventricle, right ventricle.                                           
- I'll produce final code block with a call to final_answer.                                                                              
                                                                                                                                          
I'll produce something like:                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                          
```                                                                                                                                       
final_answer("The four chambers of the heart are: 1) Left atrium, 2) Right atrium, 3) Left ventricle, and 4) Right ventricle.")           
```                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                          
I must produce code snippet in triple backticks with python code.                                                                         
                                                                                                                                          
Thus I'll produce code block like:                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                          
```                                                                                                                                       
final_answer("The four chambers of the heart are: Left Atrium, Right Atrium, Left Ventricle, and Right Ventricle.")                       
```                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                          
That's acceptable. I'll produce final answer as chain-of-thought then code snippet. So I'll produce a result with "Thought:" then code    
block. The guidelines say always provide "Thought:" sequence explanation.                                                                 
                                                                                                                                          
I need to produce chain-of-thought in the required format:                                                                                
- First, I'll write "Thought: ..." that explains I recognized the question is common medical question and it's known that heart has four  
chambers: left atrium, right atrium, left ventricle, right ventricle. Then code snippet.                                                  
I must include my chain-of-thought in a message block.                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                          
I recall instructions:
