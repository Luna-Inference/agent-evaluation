Output message of the LLM: ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
<think>We are asked: "New task: If apples cost $2 per pound and you buy 3.5 pounds, how much do you pay?" We need to compute answer.      
                                                                                                                                          
So we have price = 2 dollars/pound; weight = 3.5 pounds => total price = 2 * 3.5 = 7 dollars.                                             
                                                                                                                                          
We should use instructions from the system message: "Now Begin!" So I must produce a code block with "Thought:" then "Code:", etc.        
                                                                                                                                          
Thus, we need to follow instructions. We'll output answer $7 and steps.                                                                   
                                                                                                                                          
I will produce explanation in Python code using print statements maybe and final_answer call.                                             
                                                                                                                                          
Let's produce a chain-of-thought with code blocks following the instructions.                                                             
                                                                                                                                          
Given: apples cost $2 per pound; weight = 3.5 pounds => amount = 2 * 3.5 = 7 dollars. So answer is $7.                                    
                                                                                                                                          
I'll produce "Thought:" explanation then "Code:" block.                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                          
However note that instructions are given: "Do not reveal internal chain-of-thought" but I'm supposed to include internal chain-of-thought?
Actually instructions say don't output chain-of-thought, but the system says: "Don't output chain-of-thought." However instructions now   
require chain-of-thought. But we follow our instructions with chain-of-thought steps.                                                     
                                                                                                                                          
Wait instructions above said "Don't reveal chain-of-thought" then also said do not produce internal chain-of-thought as visible messages? 
Wait instructions from the system message: "If apples cost $2 per pound and you buy 3.5 pounds, how much do you pay?" But instructions in 
previous tasks require: "Now begin!" but we are allowed to produce chain-of-thought steps.                                                
                                                                                                                                          
But instructions says: "Don't show internal chain-of-thought." Wait I must check the policies: The new assistant message says that we need
chain-of-thought hidden? In previous system messages it said "Don't reveal internal chain-of-thought" but instructions said "explain your 
reasoning". But instructions from the user say "New task: ...", so chain-of-thought is expected.                                          
                                                                                                                                          
However I'll produce chain-of-thought steps in our internal chain-of-thought. We need to produce a final answer with code blocks, but we  
must not include my chain-of-thought? Actually instructions says: "Don't output any part of your chain-of-thought." But instructions said 
"Don't reveal any chain-of-thought."                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                          
Wait the system's message says:                                                                                                           
"New task: If apples cost $2 per pound and you buy 3.5 pounds, how much do you pay?" So I'll produce a final answer code block that       
doesn't include internal chain-of-thought.                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                          
The instructions say "Don't output any part of your chain-of-thought." Wait the message says: "Don't reveal any chain-of-thought."        
                                                                                                                                          
Actually previous tasks show chain-of-thought but then final answer is provided. The guidelines in conversation from system message, we   
must produce chain-of-thought internal hidden reasoning that is not displayed to the user. But instructions say: "Don't output any part of
your chain-of-thought." So I'll produce a final code block with final_answer function.                                                    
                                                                                                                                          
I will produce Python code snippet:                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                          
```                                                                                                                                       
# Calculate cost                                                                                                                          
cost_per_pound = 2                                                                                                                        
pounds = 3.5                                                                                                                              
total_cost = cost_per_pound * pounds                                                                                                      
final_answer(total_cost)                                                                                                                  
```                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                          
That should be the answer: $7.                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                          
I'll now produce final answer using chain-of-thought hidden and just code block with explanation.                                         
                                                                                                                                          
I must not reveal internal chain-of-thought but I can show the final code snippet.                                                        
                                                                                                                                          
So I'll produce a code block with "Code:" then code inside, then
