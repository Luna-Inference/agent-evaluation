<think>We have new task: "A 2kg object is dropped from a height of 20m. What is its velocity just before hitting the ground?" It's physics
question. The object is subject to gravitational acceleration. So initial velocity=0, using equation v^2 = u^2 + 2gh, or v = sqrt(2*g*h). 
Here g ~9.8 m/s^2 and h=20m.                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                          
v = sqrt(2 * 9.8 * 20) = sqrt(392) ≈ 19.798? Let's compute: sqrt(392)= about 19.799 (approx).                                             
                                                                                                                                          
We might also mention that mass is irrelevant to velocity if air resistance is ignored, but then answer is velocity approx: sqrt(2*g*h).  
I'll do computation: v = sqrt(2*9.8*20) = sqrt(392) ~19.798.                                                                              
                                                                                                                                          
I'll produce code with step by step. We need to adhere instructions: use code block with python code snippet that uses Python and then    
output final answer using final_answer() function.                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                          
So solution: "final_answer(sqrt(392))". I'll compute it in the code as well and output the result.
