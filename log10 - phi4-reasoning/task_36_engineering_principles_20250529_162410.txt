<think>We have new task: "Analyze the stability of a feedback control system with transfer function G(s) = K/(s^2 + 3s + 2)." This is a   
standard question about analyzing stability of closed-loop systems, I think. Let's see. The open-loop transfer function is given as G(s) =
K / (s²+3s+2). We need to analyze the stability of the feedback control system with that open loop transfer function. Likely they want us 
to check the poles of the closed loop system when using unity negative feedback.                                                          
                                                                                                                                          
The typical structure: if the plant is G(s), and the feedback controller (presumably unity feedback) then the closed-loop transfer        
function becomes T(s)= K / (s²+3s+2 +K). The characteristic equation is s^2 + 3s + (2+K)=0. So we want to analyze stability conditions as 
a function of parameter K. If K is negative, then denominator's constant term becomes less than 2, and roots might be unstable or stable  
depending on the discriminant.                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                          
Wait, wait: We have two possibilities: if it is unity feedback closed loop (or negative feedback) with transfer function T(s)=            
G(s)/(1+G(s)), then the characteristic equation is s^2 +3s +2 + K =0. Let's denote that as s^2 + 3s + (K+2)= 0.                           
                                                                                                                                          
We can analyze stability conditions in terms of parameters: The closed-loop system will be stable if all roots have negative real parts.  
We can find the poles by solving: s^2+3s+(K+2) = 0. Using Routh-Hurwitz, we need the coefficients to be positive for stability.           
                                                                                                                                          
Let's assume K is a parameter that might be any real number? But usually K > 0 in control system design. So then if K>0, then K+2>2, so   
all polynomial coefficients are positive: 1>0, 3>0, and (K+2)>2, which means the closed-loop poles have negative real parts because       
discriminant =9-4*(K+2)= 9 - 4K -8= 1-4K. So if K < 1/4 then the roots are real and distinct? Actually wait, if K is positive but less    
than 0.25, then 1-4K > 0 so discriminant positive => two real poles with negative sum. But if K> 0.25 then the discriminant becomes       
negative => complex conjugate pairs with negative real parts (due to s=-3/2 ± something). So in all cases for K>0, it's stable.           
                                                                                                                                          
For K=0, closed-loop transfer function is G(s)/(1+G(s)) = 0/(1+0) so it's trivial but then the open loop system has poles at s^2+3s+2=    
(s+1)(s+2)= -1 and -2. But the feedback with K=0 might be unstable if there is a sign reversal? Let's check: For unity negative feedback, 
the closed-loop characteristic equation becomes s^2 + 3s+2 =0 so its roots are at s=-1 and s=-2. So that system is stable.                
                                                                                                                                          
For negative values of K, then K+2 may be less than zero if |K|>2. Actually let's see: if K < -2, then the constant term becomes negative 
and the Routh-Hurwitz criterion fails because one coefficient is negative; but we can check the actual roots for specific range. Let’s    
assume unity feedback with G(s)=K/(s²+3s+2). The characteristic equation is s^2 + 3s + (K+2) =0.                                          
                                                                                                                                          
We apply Routh-Hurwitz: For a second order polynomial as ax^2 + bx + c, stability requires all coefficients positive. So we need:         
1 > 0 always true,                                                                                                                        
3 > 0 always true,                                                                                                                        
K+2 > 0 so K > -2.                                                                                                                        
Additionally if there are multiple roots then it's borderline stable if the discriminant is zero or negative (the second order polynomial 
with positive coefficients has complex conjugate pair, but stability is still preserved). So for K>-2, closed-loop system is stable. For K
= -2, characteristic equation becomes s^2+3s= s(s+3)=0 so one pole at 0 and one pole at s=-3; marginal stability? A pole on the imaginary 
axis means marginally stable if it's a repeated pole? Actually s=0 indicates a borderline case. Typically in control theory, a system with
a pole at origin is considered marginally stable if there's no oscillatory part. However, generally we call it unstable because of        
integrator type (if not properly damped). But wait, let me recall: In the sense of stability for linear systems, if all poles are         
nonpositive and any poles on the imaginary axis occur with multiplicity one and the system is non-oscillatory, then it's considered       
marginally stable. However, in standard linear control theory, a pole at 0 is not strictly unstable but is marginal stable if there are no
repeated poles. Let me recall: A continuous time LTI system is asymptotically stable if all eigenvalues have negative real parts,         
marginally stable if some eigenvalue has zero real part and none with positive real parts, and unstable otherwise. So for K = -2, the     
closed-loop characteristic equation becomes s(s+3)=0 which gives one pole at 0 and one at -3. Therefore the system is marginally stable   
(or not asymptotically stable but is neutrally stable if there's no oscillation) typically considered "marginally stable." But often a    
pole on the imaginary axis in linear systems means marginal stability, but sometimes we consider that as unstable depending on context.   
                                                                                                                                          
For K < -2, then K+2 < 0 and the characteristic equation will have two real roots with one positive and one negative. Let’s check: s^2 +3s
+(K+2)=0. The product of the roots is c = (K+2). If K+2 < 0, then one root has positive real part. So that means unstable.                
                                                                                                                                          
Let's also consider if K= -1, for example: Then characteristic equation becomes s^2 +3s +1 =0 with discriminant 9-4=5 so both roots are   
negative? Let's check: Sum of roots is -3, product is 1, and the roots are (-3 ± sqrt(5))/2. The larger root would be (-3+sqrt(5))/2 which
is approximately (-3+2.236)/2 = (-0.764/2) = -0.382 which is negative. So it's stable.                                                    
                                                                                                                                          
Let me check: For K= -1.9, then constant term equals 0.1 > 0 so stable; for K=-2 exactly, marginally stable.                              
                                                                                                                                          
Thus the stability condition depends on parameter K:                                                                                      
- If K > -2 then system is stable (if K = -2 it's marginally stable).                                                                     
- if K < -2 then system becomes unstable.                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                          
Let me check further: For positive K, the closed loop characteristic equation has all coefficients positive, so stable.                   
For negative K in (-2, 0), stable; at exactly -2 marginal; below that unstable.                                                           
                                                                                                                                          
Wait I want to check borderline condition for a second order polynomial with constant coefficient = 0. There is one pole on origin and    
another at s=-3. That system might be marginally stable if initial conditions are zero except the constant mode? However, in control      
systems theory, a continuous-time linear system is called "marginally stable" if it does not diverge but also doesn't converge to zero for
all initial conditions; that's what you get with an integrator.                                                                           
                                                                                                                                          
Let me check: For K=-2, the closed-loop transfer function is T(s) = ( -2/(s^2+3s+2) ) / (1- 2/(s^2+3s+2)) = ... Actually it's easier to   
say that the closed-loop system dynamics are determined solely by its poles. And one of them is zero, which implies that for some initial 
conditions the system output will be constant (or unbounded if there is an input) but not diverging? Actually, a pole at zero indicates   
integration; if the initial condition has a nonzero component in the mode corresponding to s=0 then you'll get non-zero steady state      
error. But it's not unstable as long as no poles have positive real parts.                                                                
                                                                                                                                          
Thus the answer: The closed-loop system will be stable for K > -2, marginally stable at K=-2 (pole on the imaginary axis), and unstable   
for K < -2.                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                          
We might also want to check the open-loop stability? But likely they ask about feedback control system with transfer function G(s) =      
K/(s^2+3s+2) which is a typical unity feedback system. So we can answer: "For a closed loop feedback system using negative unity feedback,
the closed-loop characteristic equation becomes s^2+3s+(K+2)=0. According to Routh-Hurwitz criteria for second order systems, stability   
requires K+2 > 0, i.e., K > -2. Therefore, if K > -2, the system is stable; at K = -2, it's marginally stable (with a pole at the origin);
and if K < -2, the closed loop becomes unstable."                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                          
I can also mention that the poles of the open-loop transfer function G(s) are s = -1 and s = -2. But because of feedback with gain K, the 
new closed-loop characteristic equation is s^2+3s+(K+2)=0.                                                                                
                                                                                                                                          
Thus final answer: The system stability depends on K. If K > -2 then all roots have negative real parts; if K = -2 one pole is at the     
origin (marginal stability) and if K < -2 one pole becomes positive (unstable).                                                           
                                                                                                                                          
I also check discriminant: 9-4(K+2)=1-4K, which gives borderline case when 1-4K=0 => K = 1/4. But that's not a borderline condition for   
closed loop stability, it just changes from real to complex poles. It doesn't affect stability.                                           
                                                                                                                                          
I can also mention: For the closed-loop system with unity negative feedback, the characteristic equation is s^2+3s+(K+2)=0, and by        
applying Routh-Hurwitz criteria, all coefficients must be positive for asymptotic stability (for second order polynomial), i.e., K > -2.  
                                                                                                                                          
Thus I'll provide code block that calculates roots of the characteristic equation in terms of symbolic parameter K, then analyze the      
conditions.

                <think>We have new task: "Analyze the stability of a feedback control system with transfer function G(s) = K/(s^2 + 3s + 
2)." This is a standard question about analyzing stability of closed-loop systems, I think. Let's see. The open-loop transfer function is 
given as G(s) = K / (s²+3s+2). We need to analyze the stability of the feedback control system with that open loop transfer function. 
Likely they want us to check the poles of the closed loop system when using unity negative feedback.

The typical structure: if the plant is G(s), and the feedback controller (presumably unity feedback) then the closed-loop transfer 
function becomes T(s)= K / (s²+3s+2 +K). The characteristic equation is s^2 + 3s + (2+K)=0. So we want to analyze stability conditions as 
a function of parameter K. If K is negative, then denominator's constant term becomes less than 2, and roots might be unstable or stable 
depending on the discriminant.

Wait, wait: We have two possibilities: if it is unity feedback closed loop (or negative feedback) with transfer function T(s)= 
G(s)/(1+G(s)), then the characteristic equation is s^2 +3s +2 + K =0. Let's denote that as s^2 + 3s + (K+2)= 0.

We can analyze stability conditions in terms of parameters: The closed-loop system will be stable if all roots have negative real parts. 
We can find the poles by solving: s^2+3s+(K+2) = 0. Using Routh-Hurwitz, we need the coefficients to be positive for stability.

Let's assume K is a parameter that might be any real number? But usually K > 0 in control system design. So then if K>0, then K+2>2, so 
all polynomial coefficients are positive: 1>0, 3>0, and (K+2)>2, which means the closed-loop poles have negative real parts because 
discriminant =9-4*(K+2)= 9 - 4K -8= 1-4K. So if K < 1/4 then the roots are real and distinct? Actually wait, if K is positive but less 
than 0.25, then 1-4K > 0 so discriminant positive => two real poles with negative sum. But if K> 0.25 then the discriminant becomes 
negative => complex conjugate pairs with negative real parts (due to s=-3/2 ± something). So in all cases for K>0, it's stable.

For K=0, closed-loop transfer function is G(s)/(1+G(s)) = 0/(1+0) so it's trivial but then the open loop system has poles at s^2+3s+2= 
(s+1)(s+2)= -1 and -2. But the feedback with K=0 might be unstable if there is a sign reversal? Let's check: For unity negative feedback, 
the closed-loop characteristic equation becomes s^2 + 3s+2 =0 so its roots are at s=-1 and s=-2. So that system is stable.

For negative values of K, then K+2 may be less than zero if |K|>2. Actually let's see: if K < -2, then the constant term becomes negative 
and the Routh-Hurwitz criterion fails because one coefficient is negative; but we can check the actual roots for specific range. Let’s 
assume unity feedback with G(s)=K/(s²+3s+2). The characteristic equation is s^2 + 3s + (K+2) =0.

We apply Routh-Hurwitz: For a second order polynomial as ax^2 + bx + c, stability requires all coefficients positive. So we need:
1 > 0 always true,
3 > 0 always true,
K+2 > 0 so K > -2.
Additionally if there are multiple roots then it's borderline stable if the discriminant is zero or negative (the second order polynomial 
with positive coefficients has complex conjugate pair, but stability is still preserved). So for K>-2, closed-loop system is stable. For K
= -2, characteristic equation becomes s^2+3s= s(s+3)=0 so one pole at 0 and one pole at s=-3; marginal stability? A pole on the imaginary 
axis means marginally stable if it's a repeated pole? Actually s=0 indicates a borderline case. Typically in control theory, a system with
a pole at origin is considered marginally stable if there's no oscillatory part. However, generally we call it unstable because of 
integrator type (if not properly damped). But wait, let me recall: In the sense of stability for linear systems, if all poles are 
nonpositive and any poles on the imaginary axis occur with multiplicity one and the system is non-oscillatory, then it's considered 
marginally stable. However, in standard linear control theory, a pole at 0 is not strictly unstable but is marginal stable if there are no
repeated poles. Let me recall: A continuous time LTI system is asymptotically stable if all eigenvalues have negative real parts, 
marginally stable if some eigenvalue has zero real part and none with positive real parts, and unstable otherwise. So for K = -2, the 
closed-loop characteristic equation becomes s(s+3)=0 which gives one pole at 0 and one at -3. Therefore the system is marginally stable 
(or not asymptotically stable but is neutrally stable if there's no oscillation) typically considered "marginally stable." But often a 
pole on the imaginary axis in linear systems means marginal stability, but sometimes we consider that as unstable depending on context.

For K < -2, then K+2 < 0 and the characteristic equation will have two real roots with one positive and one negative. Let’s check: s^2 +3s
+(K+2)=0. The product of the roots is c = (K+2). If K+2 < 0, then one root has positive real part. So that means unstable.

Let's also consider if K= -1, for example: Then characteristic equation becomes s^2 +3s +1 =0 with discriminant 9-4=5 so both roots are 
negative? Let's check: Sum of roots is -3, product is 1, and the roots are (-3 ± sqrt(5))/2. The larger root would be (-3+sqrt(5))/2 which
is approximately (-3+2.236)/2 = (-0.764/2) = -0.382 which is negative. So it's stable.

Let me check: For K= -1.9, then constant term equals 0.1 > 0 so stable; for K=-2 exactly, marginally stable.

Thus the stability condition depends on parameter K:
- If K > -2 then system is stable (if K = -2 it's marginally stable).
- if K < -2 then system becomes unstable.

Let me check further: For positive K, the closed loop characteristic equation has all coefficients positive, so stable.
For negative K in (-2, 0), stable; at exactly -2 marginal; below that unstable.

Wait I want to check borderline condition for a second order polynomial with constant coefficient = 0. There is one pole on origin and 
another at s=-3. That system might be marginally stable if initial conditions are zero except the constant mode? However, in control 
systems theory, a continuous-time linear system is called "marginally stable" if it does not diverge but also doesn't converge to zero for
all initial conditions; that's what you get with an integrator.

Let me check: For K=-2, the closed-loop transfer function is T(s) = ( -2/(s^2+3s+2) ) / (1- 2/(s^2+3s+2)) = ... Actually it's easier to 
say that the closed-loop system dynamics are determined solely by its poles. And one of them is zero, which implies that for some initial 
conditions the system output will be constant (or unbounded if there is an input) but not diverging? Actually, a pole at zero indicates 
integration; if the initial condition has a nonzero component in the mode corresponding to s=0 then you'll get non-zero steady state 
error. But it's not unstable as long as no poles have positive real parts.

Thus the answer: The closed-loop system will be stable for K > -2, marginally stable at K=-2 (pole on the imaginary axis), and unstable 
for K < -2.

We might also want to check the open-loop stability? But likely they ask about feedback control system with transfer function G(s) = 
K/(s^2+3s+2) which is a typical unity feedback system. So we can answer: "For a closed loop feedback system using negative unity feedback,
the closed-loop characteristic equation becomes s^2+3s+(K+2)=0. According to Routh-Hurwitz criteria for second order systems, stability 
requires K+2 > 0, i.e., K > -2. Therefore, if K > -2, the system is stable; at K = -2, it's marginally stable (with a pole at the origin);
and if K < -2, the closed loop becomes unstable."

I can also mention that the poles of the open-loop transfer function G(s) are s = -1 and s = -2. But because of feedback with gain K, the 
new closed-loop characteristic equation is s^2+3s+(K+2)=0.

Thus final answer: The system stability depends on K. If K > -2 then all roots have negative real parts; if K = -2 one pole is at the 
origin (marginal stability) and if K < -2 one pole becomes positive (unstable). 

I also check discriminant: 9-4(K+2)=1-4K, which gives borderline case when 1-4K=0 => K = 1/4. But that's not a borderline condition for 
closed loop stability, it just changes from real to complex poles. It doesn't affect stability.

I can also mention: For the closed-loop system with unity negative feedback, the characteristic equation is s^2+3s+(K+2)=0, and by 
applying Routh-Hurwitz criteria, all coefficients must be positive for asymptotic stability (for second order polynomial), i.e., K > -2.

Thus I'll provide code block that calculates roots of the characteristic equation in terms of symbolic parameter K, then analyze the 
conditions.

I can also include a Python snippet using sympy or math maybe. But I must check: instructions say we have access to tools like 
"final_answer", but not others. We need to use a python code with tool calls "final_answer" and so on.

However, note that I'm allowed to do computations in python.

I'll produce a python code snippet along the lines of:
```

Define characteristic polynomial: s^2+3s+(K+2)=0 and compute its roots. Use quadratic formula.
Then check stability conditions.

<think>I'll produce final answer in a code snippet block with triple backticks and "py" language marker. The instructions require I

Plan:                                                                                                                                     
We need to analyze stability of closed-loop system with transfer function G(s) = K/(s²+3s+2). For unity negative feedback, the closed loop
transfer function is T(s)= G(s)/(1+G(s)). That yields characteristic equation: s^2 + 3s + 2 + K=0. I'll analyze stability conditions.     
                                                                                                                                          
Detailed explanation:                                                                                                                     
For second order polynomial: s^2 + 3s + (K+2)=0, the Routh-Hurwitz criterion is that all coefficients must be positive for asymptotic     
stability. So we require:                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                          
Coefficient of s^2 is 1 > 0 always,                                                                                                       
Coefficient of s is 3 > 0 always,                                                                                                         
Constant term K+2 > 0 which implies K > -2.                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                          
So:                                                                                                                                       
- If K > -2, then the system is stable.                                                                                                   
- If K = -2, then the constant term equals zero leading to a pole at origin. That is marginally stable (not asymptotically stable).       
- If K < -2, then K+2 < 0 so one of the roots becomes positive real, thus unstable.                                                       
                                                                                                                                          
I can also mention that the discriminant is D = 9 - 4(K+2)= 1 - 4K. For K > 1/4, it yields complex conjugate pair with negative real      
parts, and for K < 1/4 they are real but still negative since sum of roots is -3.                                                         
                                                                                                                                          
I'll produce Python code snippet that calculates the roots given a symbolic parameter K or some sample values to illustrate stability.    
                                                                                                                                          
We can use math.sqrt. Alternatively, we could loop over sample values maybe K = -3, -2, -1, 0, etc.

Out - Final answer: The closed-loop system with unity negative feedback has the characteristic equation: s^2 + 3s + (K+2) = 0. According 
to the Routh-Hurwitz criterion, all coefficients must be positive for asymptotic stability. Since the coefficient of s is always 3 and 
that of s^2 is 1, we require K + 2 > 0, i.e., K > -2. Thus, if K > -2, the system is stable; at K = -2 it becomes marginally stable (with 
a pole at zero), and for K < -2 the system is unstable.

Example evaluations:
For K = -3: Discriminant = 13.000, real part = None, Stability: Unstable
For K = -2: Discriminant = 9.000, real part = None, Stability: Marginally stable (pole at origin)
For K = -1: Discriminant = 5.000, real part = None, Stability: Stable (asymptotically)
For K = 0: Discriminant = 1.000, real part = None, Stability: Stable (asymptotically)
For K = 1: Discriminant = -3.000, real part = -1.5, Stability: Stable (asymptotically)
For K = 4: Discriminant = -15.000, real part = -1.5, Stability: Stable (asymptotically)
