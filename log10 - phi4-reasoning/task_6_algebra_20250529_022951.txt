<think>We are given: "Find all real solutions to x^4 - 5x^2 + 6 = 0". This is a polynomial equation of degree 4. Let's do substitution u =
x^2 then the equation becomes: u^2 - 5u + 6 = 0 which factors as (u - 2)(u - 3) = 0, so we get u=2 or u=3. Then going back to x, note that
if u = x^2 then x^2 = 2 gives x = sqrt(2) and x = -sqrt(2), and similarly x^2=3 gives x = sqrt{3} and x = -sqrt{3}. So the real solutions 
are: ±√2, ±√3.                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                          
We need to provide answer using tool final_answer. However we have to produce output following the instructions given in the previous     
tasks.

Output message of the LLM: ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
<think>We need to produce answer with a "Thought:" section and then a valid Python code block using final_answer. We'll do exactly that.  
                                                                                                                                          
I must include the following text:                                                                                                        
"Find all real solutions to x⁴ - 5x² + 6 = 0". The equation can be solved by letting y=x^2, giving y^2-5y+6=0 which factors as            
(y-2)(y-3)=0 so y=2 or y=3. Then since x^2=2 yields x=√2 and x=-√2; and x^2=3 yields x=√3 and x=-√3.                                      
                                                                                                                                          
I must produce final answer "x = ±√2, ±√3" as string in final_answer.                                                                     
                                                                                                                                          
I'll now produce a code snippet that uses the final_answer function. Use math.sqrt if needed but not required because we want to output a 
string representation with radicals. But I think it's fine to just use strings.                                                           
                                                                                                                                          
I must check instructions: "Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ... not found". That implies that previously my       
snippet might have had issues due to formatting. So I'll produce a snippet starting with:                                                 
```

solutions = [f"√{2}", f"-√{2}", f"√{3}", f"-√{3}"]                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                          
final_answer(solutions)                                                                                                                   
```                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                          
But must double-check instructions: "Don't use new variable names that conflict with tool names." But we already have a function          
final_answer, so it's allowed.                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                          
I'll produce snippet code accordingly. I'll produce the snippet in a valid Python code block enclosed by triple backticks as required and 
then end with "
