<think>We have a new task: "Translate 'Hello, how are you?' to Spanish." The instructions say that I need to produce code sequences with  
step-by-step reasoning using the given tools. Also note that we have a set of rules: always provide "Thought:" sequence and then code     
block with ```py code.                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                          
So I'll produce a Python code snippet that uses translator function to translate the phrase from English to Spanish.                      
                                                                                                                                          
Wait, but instructions says I need to use provided notional functions. The available tools are web_search, wiki, final_answer. But also   
note we are provided "translator" in an earlier example as well.                                                                          
                                                                                                                                          
Yes the previous example used translator tool with arguments: question and so on? In one of the tasks given above: "Task: Answer the      
question in variable 'question' about image stored in variable 'image'" was solved using translator function. But that's not required for 
this task, but translation is provided by a tool "translator" as well.                                                                    
                                                                                                                                          
Let me check: The example said:                                                                                                           
"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`. The question is in French.                
You have been provided with these additional arguments, that you can access using the keys as variables in your python code:              
{'question': 'Quel est l'animal sur l'image?', 'image': 'path/to/image.jpg'}"                                                             
and then used translator function. But now our task is "Translate 'Hello, how are you?' to Spanish." So I need to use translator tool.    
                                                                                                                                          
Wait instructions mention: "You have been provided with these additional arguments" but for this new task we haven't got any additional   
variables? The text says: "New task: Translate 'Hello, how are you?' to Spanish."                                                         
                                                                                                                                          
I will now check the available notional tools. There is a list of Python functions that I can call:                                       
- web_search(query: string) -> string                                                                                                     
- visit_webpage(url: string) -> string                                                                                                    
- final_answer(answer: any) -> any                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                          
And also "translator" function in previous examples? Actually, yes. In the instructions there's not explicitly a tool "translator"? But in
the example given with image question we had translator as well.                                                                          
                                                                                                                                          
Wait let me check instructions carefully:                                                                                                 
It says: "You have been provided with these additional arguments that you can access using keys..." and then they mention 'translator'    
function in one of the examples. So I must assume translator is available to use like translator(query=, src_lang=?, tgt_lang=?). But here
our task is just translation of text.                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                          
I need to produce code block:                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                          
"Thought:" then code block with python triple backticks that uses translator with arguments: query = "Hello, how are you?" and src_lang   
maybe "English", tgt_lang "Spanish"? That is what I'll do. The final answer should be produced by calling final_answer on the translation 
result.                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                          
But instructions say: "Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence then code block." So my output must include that sequence.                    
                                                                                                                                          
I need to produce python code snippet with triple backticks and "```py" starting, then code lines ending with "```                        
Error in code parsing:
Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```(?:py|python)?\s*\n(.*?)\n``` was not found in it.

Wait, but instructions says I need to use provided notional functions. The available tools are web_search, wiki, final_answer. But also 
note we are provided "translator" in an earlier example as well.

Yes the previous example used translator tool with arguments: question and so on? In one of the tasks given above: "Task: Answer the 
question in variable 'question' about image stored in variable 'image'" was solved using translator function. But that's not required for 
this task, but translation is provided by a tool "translator" as well.

You have been provided with these additional arguments, that you can access using the keys as variables in your python code:

                It seems like you're trying to return the final answer, you can do it as follows:
                Code:

<think>The conversation has the following conversation:

Then system instructions with some guidelines. Now user's last message: "Error: Error in code parsing: Your code snippet is invalid,      
because the regex pattern ... was not found in it." But then message says:                                                                
"                Here is your code snippet:".                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                          
This seems like a potential error message from previous attempt (maybe our previous answer was incomplete or didn't contain correct       
formatting)? But now we have a new user message with "Error: ..." message.                                                                
                                                                                                                                          
User is asking: "Translate 'Hello, how are you?' to Spanish." And then there's error message. So the user message has instructions that   
say: "Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```(?:py|python)?\s*\n(.*?)\n``` was not found in it." That might be        
indicating our previous answer had a formatting error.                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                          
I need to produce an output that addresses this new task. I'll produce a Python code snippet with proper formatting containing Thought and
Code blocks, using translator tool to translate "Hello, how are you?" from English to Spanish.

I need to produce a new answer that is valid code snippet that translates the phrase "Hello, how are you?" to Spanish. The instructions   
say to use translator function maybe.                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                          
Let me re-read our conversation:                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                          
User: New task: Translate 'Hello, how are you?' to Spanish.                                                                               
Then system message with guidelines. And then user said error message, and now instructs: "Call id: call_2 ... Now let's retry: take care 
not to repeat previous errors! If you have retried several times, try a completely different approach."                                   
                                                                                                                                          
So I'll produce new answer with code snippet that is correct.                                                                             
                                                                                                                                          
I need to use translator function. Our instructions from earlier said:                                                                    
                                                                                                                                          
Example:                                                                                                                                  
```                                                                                                                                       
translated_question = translator(question=question, src_lang="French", tgt_lang="English")                                                
print(f"The translated question is {translated_question}.")                                                                               
answer = image_qa(image=image, question=translated_question)                                                                              
final_answer(f"The answer is {answer}")                                                                                                   
```                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                          
But our task now: "Translate 'Hello, how are you?' to Spanish." So I'll do something like:                                                
                                                                                                                                          
I must produce a code snippet with proper formatting. The snippet should start with Thought sequence and then Code block.                 
                                                                                                                                          
Plan:                                                                                                                                     
- Use translator function. But note instructions says "you have been provided with these additional arguments, that you can access using  
the keys as variables in your python code" but for now I think we don't need extra argument keys. We just pass translation text.          
- So code snippet:                                                                                                                        
```                                                                                                                                       
translated = translator(text="Hello, how are you?", src_lang="English", tgt_lang="Spanish")                                               
final_answer(translated)                                                                                                                  
```                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                          
Wait careful: The provided instructions require using the following tools:                                                                
web_search(query), visit_webpage(url), final_answer(answer). And also translator. But I must use exactly same argument names as in        
previous example. In previous example, we had translator(question=question, src_lang="French", tgt_lang="English"). So here I'll do       
translator(text="Hello, how are you?", src_lang="English", tgt_lang="Spanish") if that's allowed? But instructions say "don't pass        
arguments as a dict", so use directly the function call with keyword arguments.                                                           
                                                                                                                                          
I'll then produce code snippet in Python. Must start with Thought: then Code block with triple backticks, python language, code snippet,  
and ending with ```

but then it says "and also use wiki tool if needed". But our available functions from the notional list are: web_search(query: string) ->

Now let's retry: take care not to repeat previous errors! If you have retried several times, try a completely different approach."        
                                                                                                                                          
So instructions now say that translator tool is not allowed because it's not one of the explicitly allowed functions. So I must use       
allowed functions only. The allowed functions are:

- visit_webpage(url)                                                                                                                      
- final_answer(answer)                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                          
I need to translate "Hello, how are you?" from English to Spanish using a different approach. Possibly by doing a web search for          
translation maybe? Let me check: How can I get translation without translator function?                                                   
                                                                                                                                          
One idea is to use the web_search tool. But it's not clear if web_search returns translation of text? Alternatively, I might call wiki    
query "Translate 'Hello, how are you?' to Spanish" and then parse its result. But instructions say that our allowed functions are:        
web_search(query), visit_webpage(url) and final_answer(answer). The translator tool is not explicitly provided by the list.               
                                                                                                                                          
I can consider using web_search with query "translate 'Hello, how are you?' to Spanish" and then use final_answer with the result of that 
search. But note: "web_search" function returns string? It says: "Performs a duckduckgo web search based on your query (think a Google    
search) then returns the top search results. The results are lists of relevant information."                                              
                                                                                                                                          
So we can do something like:                                                                                                              
```                                                                                                                                       
result = web_search(query="translate 'Hello, how are you?' to Spanish")                                                                   
final_answer(result)                                                                                                                      
```                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                          
But might not work if result is list? Alternatively, I could use wiki query maybe "Spanish translation of Hello, how are you?" But that's 
ambiguous.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                          
Alternatively, I can also do a hard-coded approach: The known translation for "Hello, how are you?" to Spanish is "Hola, ¿cómo estás?"    
Possibly with an exclamation mark. So we know the answer. However, instructions say: "If you have retried several times, try a completely 
different approach." That might mean I should not call translator function.                                                               
                                                                                                                                          
Maybe I can use allowed functions: web_search or wiki to get translation. But maybe simpler is that I already know the translation as a   
hard-coded string? But that may be too trivial.                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                          
I need to "take a completely different approach" meaning that since translator tool is forbidden, I must rely on one of the allowed tools.
The instructions say allowed functions: web_search, visit_webpage, final_answer. So I can use the web_search function for translation     
queries.                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                          
So I'll do:                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                          
```                                                                                                                                       
result = web_search(query="translate 'Hello, how are you?' to Spanish")                                                                   
final_answer(result)                                                                                                                      
```                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                          
But then result might be a list of strings. But maybe that's acceptable? Alternatively, I could try to parse the output and pick the first
line. But instructions say "the final answer should be computed using allowed functions only".                                            
                                                                                                                                          
I can use web_search query: "translate 'Hello, how are you?' to Spanish". Let me consider if this query is likely to produce a result that
contains translation: The known translation is "Hola, ¿cómo estás?" So I might try to do:                                                 
                                                                                                                                          
```                                                                                                                                       
result = web_search(query="Translate Hello, how are you? from English to Spanish")                                                        
final_answer(result)                                                                                                                      
```                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                          
But then final answer should be exactly the translation string.                                                                           
                                                                                                                                          
Maybe I can use wiki query "Hello how are you in Spanish" but that's not standard. Alternatively, we know that wiki tool is allowed? Wait 
instructions: Allowed functions: web_search(query), visit_webpage(url), final_answer(answer). Wiki function is mentioned earlier:         
"wiki(query)" but then the list of functions includes web_search and visit_webpage and final_answer explicitly. But there is a previous   
example using wiki in our conversation but not in our allowed list? The instructions say: "The state persists between code executions: so 
if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist." And then it says: "You have been provided with these
additional arguments that you can access using keys as variables in your python code:" But they don't include translator. So allowed      
function is web_search and final_answer.                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                          
I must check instructions again:
