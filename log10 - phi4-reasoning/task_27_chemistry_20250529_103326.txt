<think>User asks: "Explain the mechanism of SN2 nucleophilic substitution and predict the stereochemistry of the product." We need to     
produce explanation mechanism of SN2 nucleophilic substitution reaction, including details on how it happens, what is inversion of        
configuration. So answer should provide detailed explanation: In an SN2 reaction, the nucleophile attacks the electrophilic carbon from   
the backside relative to leaving group, resulting in a transition state with partial bonds and inversion of stereochemistry. The mechanism
is concerted and bimolecular, so second order kinetics. We'll produce explanation as output. I'll produce code block with Python code?    
Wait instructions: "Explain ...", so we need to provide explanation.                                                                      
                                                                                                                                          
But guidelines instruct that we can use python functions, but there's no specific code required. But we are allowed to produce answer text
using final_answer function and then final answer should be printed. The user task doesn't require any tools call. However, guidelines    
say: "Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, a 'Code:' sequence with Python code block ending with

<think>User now says "Explain the mechanism of SN2 nucleophilic substitution and predict the stereochemistry of the product." We need to  
produce explanation. The answer should be text with code blocks.                                                                          
                                                                                                                                          
We must produce answer in two parts: Explanation plus final_answer function call using python. The instructions require a "Thought:"      
sequence, then a "Code:" sequence containing our Python code. Our code snippet will contain a call to final_answer function after         
computing the result or explanation string? But guidelines say that output should be provided as final answer with code block in python.  
                                                                                                                                          
We need to produce an explanation of SN2 mechanism and mention predicted stereochemistry outcome: inversion of configuration from starting
material to product (i.e. Walden inversion). So answer text:                                                                              
                                                                                                                                          
Explanation: In SN2 nucleophilic substitution reaction, the process is concerted one-step mechanism involving a backside attack on the    
substrate carbon by the nucleophile while the leaving group simultaneously departs. The transition state is pentavalent with partial bonds
between nucleophile and electrophilic carbon and leaving group. Because of this backside attack, the stereochemistry inverts relative to  
the starting material: if we begin with R configuration at the chiral center, the product will be S (and vice versa). This phenomenon is  
known as Walden inversion.                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                          
Mechanism details:                                                                                                                        
- SN2 stands for "substitution nucleophilic bimolecular".                                                                                 
- It has second order kinetics.                                                                                                           
- The reaction involves a backside attack by the nucleophile on an electrophilic carbon that bears leaving group.                         
- The reaction proceeds in one step, with no intermediate formation.                                                                      
- Transition state geometry is trigonal bipyramidal or pentavalent, where both incoming and outgoing bonds are partially formed.          
- Stereoelectronic factors such as steric hindrance and orbital alignment determine the rate of SN2 reactions.                            
                                                                                                                                          
Predicted stereochemistry: Inversion of configuration occurs at the reactive center. For instance, if starting material is chiral with a  
specific absolute configuration (say R), the product will have inverted configuration (S).                                                
                                                                                                                                          
I can produce code block:                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                          
```

final_answer("The SN2 mechanism involves a backside attack by a nucleophile on an electrophilic carbon bearing a leaving group in a       
single, concerted step. The transition state is pentavalent with partial bonds to both the nucleophile and the leaving group, leading to a

sequence" followed by a python code snippet that calls final_answer() function.                                                           
                                                                                                                                          
So we want a final answer message in text that explains SN2 nucleophilic substitution mechanism including stereochemistry inversion       
details.                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                          
I must include two sections: Thought and Code, and then produce the final answer as final answer. I'll produce a code block starting with 
"```py" then a python snippet calling final_answer function with string argument containing explanation.                                  
                                                                                                                                          
We need to ensure that our output is exactly following guidelines. I've produced similar code in previous answer but now I must correct   
the code block pattern formatting errors.

Output:
The SN2 mechanism involves a backside attack by a nucleophile on an electrophilic carbon bearing a leaving group. This reaction proceeds via a single concerted step with a pentavalent transition state where both the nucleophile and the leaving group are partially bonded to the substrate carbon. The backside attack results in inversion of configuration at the reactive center (Walden inversion), so if the starting material is chiral, its stereochemistry is completely inverted in the product.
