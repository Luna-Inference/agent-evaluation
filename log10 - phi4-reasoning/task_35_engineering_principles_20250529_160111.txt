<think>User's new task: "Design a simple bridge truss to span 20 feet with a load capacity of 5000 lbs." We need to design a simple bridge
truss.                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                          
We are given instructions: "You have been provided with these additional arguments, that you can access using the keys as variables in    
your python code:                                                                                                                         
{'question': 'Quel est l'animal sur l'image?', 'image': 'path/to/image.jpg'}" Wait no. Actually not applicable to this question. The user 
gave new task now.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                          
So we have a design problem. We want to design a simple bridge truss that spans 20 feet with load capacity of 5000 lbs. This is an        
engineering design problem. I must provide a description and maybe code. But our tools are just "final_answer", etc. Our instructions: We 
are allowed to use python functions from the list provided: web_search, wiki, visit_webpage, search, translator, image_generator,         
document_qa, image_qa, etc.                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                          
We need to solve design problem using our available knowledge and possibly simulation? But we only have tools for simple tasks like       
computation. Actually this is a structural engineering design question. The user task "Design a simple bridge truss" has ambiguous        
parameters such as: span of 20 ft, load capacity 5000 lbs (which is roughly 22.68 kN) but maybe I can provide some notes. We want to      
design a simple bridge truss, so likely we'll choose a Pratt or Warren type truss.                                                        
                                                                                                                                          
The answer should be clearly provided with the steps and design parameters. I'll use "Code:" sequence as required: I must produce python  
code blocks that simulate these tasks.                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                          
I need to do this: It is an engineering question. I can provide a conceptual design for a simple bridge truss using, say, a Warren truss  
or Pratt truss design. Steps: define span=20 ft; load capacity 5000 lbs. The typical procedure: choose material steel or wood? Maybe      
steel.                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                          
I'll assume the use of steel. Let me consider that each chord member might be sized for bending and axial loads. Alternatively, I can     
design a simple truss with top chords being in tension (vertical loads). But it's not trivial to do structural analysis from scratch.     
                                                                                                                                          
We need to design a simple bridge truss: The span is 20 ft. The load capacity is 5000 lbs. We could assume a uniform distributed load or  
concentrated load? I'd assume maybe worst-case scenario is 5000 lbs uniformly distributed along the top chord, or perhaps dead loads with 
some live load.                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                          
We can design a Warren truss with equidistant panels. Let's say we want to have 5 panels across (so panel length = 4 ft). But wait, 20 ft 
/ 4 = 5 panels, but then you'll get maybe a trapezoidal shape? Alternatively, if I use the typical Pratt design with vertical members in  
tension and diagonals in compression. The load capacity is quite low for a pedestrian or light vehicle crossing.                          
                                                                                                                                          
I need to give a design description: "This simple bridge truss is designed using a Warren truss system" maybe. We can pick material       
properties such as steel yield strength of 50 ksi (maybe). But then I'll assume members are sized accordingly. Alternatively, I could say 
"To achieve a load capacity of 5000 lbs, we design each member with a cross-sectional area sufficient to handle the axial forces computed 
from static equilibrium."                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                          
Maybe I can provide a sample calculation:                                                                                                 
Let me do: Assume truss is symmetrical and simply supported at ends. It supports a uniform distributed load of 250 lbs/ft (20 ft * 250 =  
5000 lbs). Then compute internal member forces using method of joints, e.g., for the bottom chord, top chord etc.                         
                                                                                                                                          
I can design a Warren truss with five panels maybe. Let's say we have 6 nodes along the bottom and 5 on the top? Actually a typical Warren
truss is made of alternating diagonal members.                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                          
Let's propose a design: A simple Warren truss with 7 joints (if it's symmetric, there will be an odd number of panels). However, I need to
define geometry: The span is 20 ft horizontally, height maybe around 4 ft. Then the angle calculations can be made.                       
                                                                                                                                          
I could provide a simplified analysis: For each member, compute force assuming load distribution and then size members with steel with    
yield stress. But without a full structural calculation tool it's approximated design.                                                    
                                                                                                                                          
Alternatively I can say "Design a truss with Warren configuration: The bottom chord length 20 ft is divided into 5 panels of equal length 
(4 ft). The top chord similarly, but with slight slope so that the diagonals form angles approximately 45 degrees. The vertical load      
capacity is determined by tension in diagonals and compression in verticals. For a uniform distributed load of 250 lb/ft, you compute     
member forces using static analysis. Member dimensions are chosen such that axial stresses remain below allowable limits."                
                                                                                                                                          
I'll provide more details: Material: Structural steel with yield strength 36 ksi maybe. Then calculate force in the bottom chord under    
midspan load.                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                          
Let me do a simple approximate calculation: Using method of joints for truss with symmetric geometry. Alternatively, I can propose to use 
a standard truss design from literature. But we need to deliver answer.                                                                   
                                                                                                                                          
I will provide a step-by-step explanation:                                                                                                
Step 1: Choose type of truss - I choose Warren Truss.                                                                                     
Step 2: Define dimensions: span=20 ft, height = 4 ft, with five panels each of length 4 ft along bottom chord (maybe also same for top    
chord? Actually in a Warren truss the chords are horizontal, and diagonals connect alternating nodes. But then if the top chord is        
horizontal, then the diagonals will be sloping. The angle can be computed as: angle = arctan( (height)/(half-panel length) ) maybe 0. So  
no, need to recalc.                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                          
Maybe I choose a Pratt truss instead? Because it's simpler for calculation.                                                               
                                                                                                                                          
Alternatively, design: "A simple Pratt Truss" with vertical members in tension and diagonals in compression. The typical Pratt truss:     
bottom chord is horizontal, top chord is sloping upward from center maybe. Wait what is the geometry of Pratt truss? Typically, a Pratt   
truss has diagonal members sloping downward from top joints to bottom joints on each side, while verticals are in tension.                
                                                                                                                                          
But I'll design with Pratt truss:                                                                                                         
- Span = 20 ft                                                                                                                            
- Height = maybe 3 ft (for pedestrian footbridge)                                                                                         
- Dividing into panels, say 4 ft each (so that gives 5 panels).                                                                           
- Loads: Assume a live load of 5000 lbs uniformly distributed or concentrated.                                                            
                                                                                                                                          
I can then compute member forces at midspan. But without details it's not trivial to design fully. I'll provide a simplified analysis and 
design suggestions.                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                          
Alternatively, I could say "Design a Pratt truss with chord lengths as follows: Bottom chord: 20 ft, Top chord: 16 ft (if using typical   
Pratt geometry) but then verticals and diagonals arranged."                                                                               
                                                                                                                                          
I can provide some approximations. Let me assume the following:                                                                           
The load capacity is 5000 lbs, so I need to check that the maximum member force doesn't exceed allowable stress. For steel with yield     
strength of 50ksi, if we want a safety factor of 2, allowable stress = 25 ksi (25000 psi). Then required cross-sectional area for any     
member with force F would be A >= F / sigma.                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                          
I can compute approximate forces using method of joints for a Pratt truss under uniform load. The maximum bending moment is at midspan.   
But since it's a truss, the members experience axial forces.                                                                              
                                                                                                                                          
I could say: "Assuming a simplified analysis yields maximum axial force in bottom chord member around 4000 lbs and top chord about 3000   
lbs." Then cross-sectional area required would be: for bottom chord: A >= 4000/25000 = 0.16 in^2, which is too low; likely design would   
use standard rolled steel sections.                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                          
We could choose a W8x10 or something? Actually, let me propose: "For a pedestrian bridge with these loads, a typical design might use 3/4 
inch steel plates for web members." But that's not entirely correct.                                                                      
                                                                                                                                          
I must provide a detailed description and perhaps a schematic drawing in text. I can say: "The following is a conceptual design for a     
simple Pratt truss footbridge spanning 20 ft with a load capacity of 5000 lbs."                                                           
                                                                                                                                          
Plan:                                                                                                                                     
1. Truss Type: Pratt Truss.                                                                                                               
2. Geometry:                                                                                                                              
   - Total span = 20 ft, divided into 5 equal panels (each panel length 4 ft).                                                            
   - Height of the truss = 3 ft (for example) at midspan, reducing to 0 ft at the ends. Actually Pratt truss usually has vertical members 
on the bottom chord if designed for tension in the diagonals.                                                                             
   Alternatively, use a Warren Truss design.                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                          
Given the simplicity of instructions, I'll choose a Warren truss which is easier to analyze. But then load capacity and member force      
distribution are different.                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                          
I recall that a Warren truss typically uses alternating diagonal members. For a symmetrical Warren truss with 5 panels (6 nodes on each   
chord) and height = maybe 3 ft, the diagonals will have slope approx: angle = arctan(height / half panel length) = arctan(3/4) ~ 36.87    
deg.                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                          
I can then compute forces in chords for uniform load. Alternatively, I'll provide a simplified design approach without detailed           
calculations and include references to standard engineering practice.                                                                     
                                                                                                                                          
I must incorporate python code block as instructions require: "Use Code:" sequence followed by python code block with our answer. But the 
final answer requires a final_answer call with the final answer string.                                                                   
                                                                                                                                          
I need to produce steps in code blocks as required:                                                                                       
- We are allowed to use functions such as web_search, wiki etc if needed.                                                                 
- The design problem is structural engineering; I might not have direct computation tool for static analysis but I can simulate it. But   
likely I'll write a python code block that outlines the design parameters and then call final_answer with a summary.                      
                                                                                                                                          
I need to provide our answer in "Thought:" sequence: explaining the steps, then "Code:" block with Python code that uses some functions.  
Possibly, I might use `web_search` to find similar designs? But instructions: "Do not pass arguments as dictionary." Use them directly.   
                                                                                                                                          
Maybe I'll do:                                                                                                                            
Step 1: Provide design type.                                                                                                              
Step 2: Calculate approximate member forces using simplified assumptions (like method of joints).                                         
Step 3: Choose material and cross-sectional area.                                                                                         
Step 4: Summarize design details in a description string, then pass that to final_answer.                                                 
                                                                                                                                          
I can structure code as:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                          
```
