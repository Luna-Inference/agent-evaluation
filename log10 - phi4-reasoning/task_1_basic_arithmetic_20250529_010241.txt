<think>We are given a new task: "What is 15 + 27?" We need to compute. Let's see instructions:                                            
                                                                                                                                          
We have instructions as above, that if the user asks an arithmetic problem "What is 15+27?" then we should answer using code block.       
According to example tasks: "What is the result of operation: ...". So use python snippet with code block.                                
                                                                                                                                          
But first, note that the instructions require:

Then the assistant output provided by the assistant in our answer should be following instructions as above. Our answer: "What is 15+27?" 
equals 42. However the instructions require to always provide a Thought sequence, and then a Code block with code snippet that uses tool
