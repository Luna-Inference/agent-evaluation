<think>User says: "Explain the pathophysiology of Type 2 diabetes mellitus." We have a long explanation. We need to answer with           
explanation, following instructions. We'll produce explanation in text format.                                                            
                                                                                                                                          
The user's query: "Explain the pathophysiology of Type 2 diabetes mellitus" means we are asked to provide explanation of its pathology.   
                                                                                                                                          
We must follow instructions from system message and internal guidelines for chain-of-thought reasoning steps using "Thought:" and code    
snippet. Actually, our solution should be in multiple steps with Thought:, Code:, etc. We'll produce a final answer as text explanation   
with details.                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                          
Step 1: Identify that the question is asking about pathophysiology of Type 2 diabetes mellitus. So I'll produce an explanation in plain   
language using bullet points maybe. Also include things like insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction, increased hepatic glucose      
production, etc.                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                          
Plan:                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                          
I recall that the pathophysiology of T2DM includes:                                                                                       
- Insulin Resistance: tissues (muscle, fat, liver) are resistant to insulin's effect, leading to hyperinsulinemia initially.              
- Beta cell dysfunction: eventually beta cells fail to produce enough insulin.                                                            
- Increased hepatic gluconeogenesis and decreased glucose uptake in muscle.                                                               
                                                                                                                                          
I can include details on genetic predisposition, lifestyle factors etc. I'll generate detailed explanation text:                          
                                                                                                                                          
Let's produce an answer explanation that is thorough:                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                          
I say "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) pathophysiology involves multiple organ system changes. It is characterized by insulin resistance  
and relative insulin deficiency. In the initial stage, tissues become resistant to insulin's action, especially muscle and adipose tissue.
This leads to decreased glucose uptake into cells, resulting in hyperglycemia."                                                           
                                                                                                                                          
Then: "The pancreas initially secretes more insulin (hyperinsulinemia) to overcome this resistance. Over time, however, beta cell function
declines due to glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity, leading to insufficient insulin production relative to the body's needs."                 
                                                                                                                                          
I also mention that adipose tissue plays a role in inflammation. Excess free fatty acids contribute to insulin resistance.                
                                                                                                                                          
Also mention "Increased hepatic gluconeogenesis": The liver increases glucose production because of reduced suppression by insulin. Also  
mention role of inflammatory cytokines, and genetic predisposition.                                                                       
                                                                                                                                          
I can include details such as: "Insulin resistance is the inability of peripheral tissues (muscle, fat) to respond appropriately to normal
levels of circulating insulin, leading to increased blood sugar."                                                                         
                                                                                                                                          
Then I'll add that "Beta cell dysfunction" is characterized by decreased insulin secretion. Also mention "In T2DM, hyperglycemia results  
from the combined effect of decreased glucose uptake and increased hepatic gluconeogenesis."                                              
                                                                                                                                          
I also include details on how obesity contributes: "Obesity, particularly central adiposity, is strongly associated with insulin          
resistance due to increased free fatty acids and inflammatory markers such as TNF-alpha, IL-6 which interfere with insulin signaling."    
                                                                                                                                          
I'll produce answer in plain text. I must ensure that my final answer is produced using a code snippet? The instructions require: "Follow 
these rules: always include Thought and Code blocks."                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                          
The instructions require:                                                                                                                 
1. Provide a 'Thought:' sequence.                                                                                                         
2. Provide a 'Code:' block.                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                          
But the question is about explaining pathophysiology, so it's likely I'll produce final answer as text. However instructions say that we  
must always use two sequences: a Thought and then a Code snippet with our explanation code? The examples show in each step "Thought:" and 
"Code:". But instructions require to provide these sequences.                                                                             
                                                                                                                                          
I need to produce an answer with multiple code blocks following the structure:                                                            
Firstly, I'll produce my thought sequence reasoning. Then I'll produce code block containing python code that calls final_answer()        
function with our explanation string as parameter.                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                          
Let's produce a step by step explanation:                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                          
Plan: We'll produce final answer as text explanation in Python final_answer() function call. But instructions require to use code blocks  
with triple backticks, then                                                                                                               
Error in code parsing:
Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```(?:py|python)?\s*\n(.*?)\n``` was not found in it.
                Here is your code snippet:
                <think>User says: "Explain the pathophysiology of Type 2 diabetes mellitus." We have a long explanation. We need to answer
with explanation, following instructions. We'll produce explanation in text format.

The user's query: "Explain the pathophysiology of Type 2 diabetes mellitus" means we are asked to provide explanation of its pathology.

We must follow instructions from system message and internal guidelines for chain-of-thought reasoning steps using "Thought:" and code 
snippet. Actually, our solution should be in multiple steps with Thought:, Code:, etc. We'll produce a final answer as text explanation 
with details.

- Insulin Resistance: tissues (muscle, fat, liver) are resistant to insulin's effect, leading to hyperinsulinemia initially.
- Beta cell dysfunction: eventually beta cells fail to produce enough insulin.
- Increased hepatic gluconeogenesis and decreased glucose uptake in muscle.

I can include details on genetic predisposition, lifestyle factors etc. I'll generate detailed explanation text:

I need to produce an answer with multiple code blocks following the structure:

with triple backticks, then 
                It seems like you're trying to return the final answer, you can do it as follows:
                Code:
                ```py
                final_answer("YOUR FINAL ANSWER HERE")
                ```<end_code>
Make sure to provide correct code blobs.

<think>User asks: "Explain the pathophysiology of Type 2 diabetes mellitus."                                                              
                                                                                                                                          
We need to produce answer that is in chain-of-thought reasoning with multiple code blocks using python code snippet. But instructions     
require following guidelines from previous conversation message. However, note our conversation: There's a message about error "Error in  
code parsing" but it looks like the user just provided additional information. The content of the user message seems to be simply "Explain
the pathophysiology of Type 2 diabetes mellitus." And then we have instructions on how to produce answer using chain-of-thought reasoning 
with Code blocks.                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                          
We need to produce answer as explained above. We'll produce a final answer explanation in plain text using code block, and then use python
function call final_answer().                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                          
So I'll produce something like:                                                                                                           
```                                                                                                                                       
final_answer("The pathophysiology of Type 2 diabetes mellitus is characterized by insulin resistance ...")                                
```                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                          
But we must also include "Thought:" blocks and "Code:" blocks. We need to produce an explanation text that is clear and detailed,         
referencing multiple aspects: insulin resistance in muscle, liver, and adipose tissue; beta-cell dysfunction; the role of obesity and     
inflammatory cytokines; hyperinsulinemia initially then progression to relative deficiency.                                               
                                                                                                                                          
I'll produce a final answer as follows:                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                          
Step 1: "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is primarily characterized by insulin resistance in peripheral tissues (muscle, fat, liver),     
leading to decreased glucose uptake and increased hepatic gluconeogenesis. Initially, the pancreas compensates with increased insulin     
secretion (hyperinsulinemia). However, over time, due to beta-cell dysfunction from chronic exposure to high glucose and free fatty acids 
(glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity), the beta cells become exhausted and fail to produce sufficient insulin to overcome resistance."         
                                                                                                                                          
Step 2: "Obesity, particularly central adiposity, contributes to the development of insulin resistance by releasing pro-inflammatory      
cytokines like TNF-alpha and IL-6 that interfere with insulin signaling pathways."                                                        
                                                                                                                                          
Step 3: "The combination of peripheral insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction leads to chronic hyperglycemia. In addition, defective
suppression of hepatic glucose production further exacerbates hyperglycemia."                                                             
                                                                                                                                          
I'll produce a text explanation and then call final_answer().                                                                             
                                                                                                                                          
Thus I'll produce:                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                          
```                                                                                                                                       
final_answer("... detailed text ...")                                                                                                     
```                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                          
I must produce code block with triple backticks and python code in that code snippet. We have to be careful not to produce extra output   
other than our final answer. Also instructions require the following: "Don't chain too many sequential tool calls in the same block" so   
I'll just produce one call.                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                          
I'll also produce a Thought block at the beginning, then Code block with python code that returns final answer string using final_answer()
function. We are not allowed to include markdown formatting aside from code blocks. The instructions require "Follow these rules: always  
provide a 'Thought:' sequence and a 'Code:' sequence."                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                          
Thus I'll produce our solution:                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                          
I'll produce "Thought:" text, then code block with triple backticks of Python code using final_answer() function.                         
                                                                                                                                          
Let's produce code snippet:                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                          
```                                                                                                                                       
final_answer("Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is characterized by two major pathophysiological defects: insulin resistance and impaired
