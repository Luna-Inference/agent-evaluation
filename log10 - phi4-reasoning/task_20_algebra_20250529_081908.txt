<think>We are given a new task "Factor completely: x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6". This is a polynomial factoring question. The factorization      
likely is (x-1)(x-2)(x-3). Let's check: (x - 1)(x - 2) = x^2 - 3x + 2; multiply with (x-3): result equals x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x -6. So answer  
is factored completely.                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                          
We need to use our guidelines "Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:' sequence ending with ```py ...                         
Error in code parsing:
Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```(?:py|python)?\s*\n(.*?)\n``` was not found in it.
            Here is your code snippet:

<think>User provided new task: "Factor completely: x³ - 6x² + 11x - 6" and then provided an error message regarding code parsing error    
with regex. The error is that our previous code snippet was invalid because the regex pattern did not match.                              
                                                                                                                                          
We need to produce a valid code snippet following instructions, using Python code block.                                                  
                                                                                                                                          
Our answer: "Factor completely: x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6" factorization is (x-1)(x-2)(x-3). I'll provide final answer: Final answer is (x -   
1)(x - 2)(x - 3). But we need to output using "final_answer()" tool with the result. The instructions say that we are allowed to use tools
like wiki, web_search, etc.

But the new task is "Factor completely: x³ - 6x² + 11x - 6". The instructions are to produce valid code snippet with a Python code block

marker.                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                          
I should mention in my final answer: "Final Answer is (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)".
