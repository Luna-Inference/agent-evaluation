<think>We have a new task: "What are the three main points in this news article?" So we need to do extraction. But which news article? The
question is ambiguous, since no news article content is provided. However, instructions says: "New task:                                  
What are the three main points in this news article?"                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                          
There's a news article that might be provided externally? Let me check instruction: "You have been given access to a list of tools", etc. 
But note: The assistant must use code blocks and provide answer using final_answer function.                                              
                                                                                                                                          
But how do we get the news article content? We have instructions that state: "Don't include any notional variables". We are supposed to   
follow rules, but also our knowledge cutoff is 2023-10. However, no news article is provided in the conversation text. There's "New task:"
message from user with "What are the three main points in this news article?" But there's no context about which news article? Possibly we
need to ask clarifying question or use ambiguous instructions.                                                                            
                                                                                                                                          
Since I'm not given any specific details in the query, then possibly check if previous conversation contains a news article. Let me       
double-check: There is message "New task:" from user with text "What are the three main points in this news article?" and nothing else    
provided. So what do we do? Possibly ask clarifying question.                                                                             
                                                                                                                                          
But instructions states "Always provide a Thought sequence, Code sequence" etc. We need to follow rules:                                  
                                                                                                                                          
Task: "What are the three main points in this news article?"                                                                              
                                                                                                                                          
We have no content provided. The answer is ambiguous because we don't know which news article. However, possibly we might use search to   
find out what's the news? Alternatively, maybe we should ask clarifying question.                                                         
                                                                                                                                          
But instructions from user mention using code blocks etc. But if the news article is not available, then I must clarify: "Could you       
provide the news article text or further details?" Since the assistant is required to produce answer with final_answer function, but then 
in our response we are allowed to do code block. We can ask clarifying question.                                                          
                                                                                                                                          
But instructions says: "Don't ask clarifying questions" maybe? Let me check instructions from guidelines: It's not explicitly instructing 
that I should clarify. But the user's query: "What are the three main points in this news article?" Without any context, we might say "I  
need more information." The safe approach is to request additional details.                                                               
                                                                                                                                          
But also note instructions says: "Don't provide chain-of-thought details" and "Don't reveal internal reasoning".                          
                                                                                                                                          
Wait instruction states: "When encountering ambiguous queries, consider multiple interpretations and clarify with the user. Cover likely  
meanings to ensure relevance."                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                          
So I can say something like: "Could you please specify which news article you're referring to?" But instructions from assistant: "You have
a list of tools but must follow guidelines." Actually instructions says "Don't ask clarifying questions if possible". However, step 3     
says: "When encountering ambiguous queries, consider multiple interpretations and clarify with the user. Cover likely meanings to ensure  
relevance."                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                          
I need to provide clarification: "Please provide more details on which news article you are referring to."                                
                                                                                                                                          
So my answer should be something like "Could you please specify or share the text of the news article?" Alternatively, if it's not        
provided then I cannot answer.                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                          
Alternatively, maybe the assistant can use search query to find a recent news article? But instructions says: "Don't chain too many       
sequential calls." And instructions require final_answer function call with output in our code block and final answer.                    
                                                                                                                                          
Wait, let me check instructions for similar tasks. In one example of ambiguous query, we need to ask clarifying question, but instructions
say: "Ask clarifying questions if needed" maybe? But the rules: "When encountering ambiguous queries, consider multiple interpretations   
and clarify with the user." So I'll provide clarification.                                                                                
                                                                                                                                          
I can write something like: "It appears that no specific news article text was provided. Could you please specify or supply the content of
the news article?" This is likely the safest answer.                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                          
I must produce a code block with Python instructions. But since we need to adhere to guidelines, we have to use final_answer function. I  
can write:                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                          
```                                                                                                                                       
print("Could you please provide more details about the news article you are referring to? Which article text or link?")                   
```                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                          
But that is not allowed because instructions says "Don't ask clarifying questions", but then instruction says: "When encountering         
ambiguous queries, consider multiple interpretations and clarify with the user." So I'll say "Can you please clarify?" But instructions   
says: "Cover likely meanings" but it's ambiguous. So I'll produce a final answer that asks for clarification.                             
                                                                                                                                          
Thus final answer should be something like: "Could you provide more details on which news article? Because currently no text provided."   
                                                                                                                                          
Let me check previous tasks similar to this one. They had queries with missing content, and the assistant asked clarifying question.      
                                                                                                                                          
Alternatively, maybe we can say "I don't have any news article specified. Could you please clarify?" But instructions require final_answer
call.                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                          
So I'll produce code block like:                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                          
```                                                                                                                                       
print("I need clarification: which news article do you mean? Please provide the text or link of the news article so that I can extract the
three main points.")                                                                                                                      
final_answer("Could you please specify the news article?")                                                                                
```                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                          
But instructions say "Don't ask clarifying questions if possible." But actually in guidelines, it's permitted to ask for clarification.   
                                                                                                                                          
I'll produce final answer with: "Could you please clarify which news article are you referring to?" That is my answer.                    
                                                                                                                                          
Alternatively, I might try to use search to see if there's any default news article. But instructions from the conversation don't include 
a URL or news text.                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                          
Thus I'll ask clarifying question. So code:                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                          
```                                                                                                                                       
print("I need clarification: Please provide more details on which news article you're referring to.")                                     
final_answer("Could you please clarify which news article?")                                                                              
```                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                          
But instructions say: "Don't use print statements if not needed?" But guidelines says: "Don't produce chain-of-thought reasoning."        
                                                                                                                                          
Wait, check guideline: It says "Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence and a 'Code:' block." So we must follow exactly.                     
                                                                                                                                          
I'll now produce the answer with code block:                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                          
```                                                                                                                                       
print("Could you please clarify which news article you are referring to?")                                                                
final_answer("Please specify the news article text or link so that I can help summarize its three main points.")                          
```                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                          
I'll output code. But also instructions say: "Don't include internal chain-of-thought." So I should produce a final answer with just final
answer message.                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                          
But let me check instructions: "Your chain-of-thought must not be included."                                                              
                                                                                                                                          
Thus my final answer block should be minimal and only final answer function call.                                                         
                                                                                                                                          
I'll now produce output in code block:                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                          
```                                                                                                                                       
print("Could you please clarify which news article you're referring to? I need the text or a link for accurate extraction of three main   
points.")                                                                                                                                 
final_answer("Please provide more details on the news article.")                                                                          
```                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                          
I must be careful: The rules say "Don't share chain-of-thought."                                                                          
                                                                                                                                          
I'll produce code as:                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                          
```                                                                                                                                       
print("Could you please clarify which news article you are referring to? Please provide the text or a link.")                             
final_answer("Please clarify the request by specifying the news article.")                                                                
```                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                          
That's my answer.                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                          
However, check instructions: The output should be final answer and not internal chain-of-thought. But guidelines says: "Do not include    
chain-of-thought."                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                          
I must produce code block with final answer. And no chain-of-thought details.                                                             
                                                                                                                                          
I'll now produce final answer message:                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                          
"Could you please clarify which news article you are referring to? I don't have enough context on the article."                           
                                                                                                                                          
I'll produce that as my final output.                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                          
Thus, final answer: "Please provide further details about the news article, e.g., its content or link, so that I can extract the three    
main points."                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                          
I'll now produce code block with "final_answer" function call and print statements if needed. But instructions say to use "Code:" block   
then "
