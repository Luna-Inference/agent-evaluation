<think>User asks: "What is the formula for kinetic energy?"                                                                               
                                                                                                                                          
We need to answer that question. We are to use code blocks in our reasoning steps. I must produce output that uses a sequence of Thought  
and Code blocks.                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                          
Let's check instructions: The conversation says instructions, then task "What is the formula for kinetic energy?" We must respond with a  
final answer using "final_answer" tool. And instructions say:                                                                             
                                                                                                                                          
1. Use Python code snippet sequences.                                                                                                     
2. Answer should be in one block? Actually our output must follow sequence of Thought and Code blocks.                                    
                                                                                                                                          
I must produce answer: The formula for kinetic energy is KE = 0.5 m v^2, or sometimes written as (1/2) m v^2.                             
                                                                                                                                          
We are to use instructions provided above.                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                          
Thus I produce "Thought:" block with explanation that the formula is KE=1/2 mv^2. Then produce code snippet using final_answer() function.
                                                                                                                                          
I'll produce answer code like:                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                          
Code:                                                                                                                                     
```                                                                                                                                       
final_answer("The formula for kinetic energy is (1/2) m v^2.")                                                                            
```                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                          
But instructions require "Use variables defined", so I'll define a variable, say KE_formula = "(1/2)*m*v**2" then print or pass to        
final_answer.                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                          
I will produce code snippet:                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                          
```                                                                                                                                       
kinetic_energy_formula = "1/2 * mass * velocity^2"                                                                                        
final_answer(kinetic_energy_formula)                                                                                                      
```                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                          
But careful: instructions says not to have chain calls in same code block maybe? But the sample tasks do that with a single call at end.  
The instruction said we must produce final answer using final_answer. And each block must use "python" code snippet.                      
                                                                                                                                          
Thus I'll produce a "Thought:" and "Code:" sequence:                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                          
I'll produce a "final_answer" function call inside the code block. Use variable names: formula = "1/2 * m * v^2".                         
                                                                                                                                          
I'll produce text in my answer accordingly.                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                          
I'll produce output with final_answer().                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                          
Let's produce the result as Python code snippet with "Code:" block containing:                                                            
                                                                                                                                          
```                                                                                                                                       
formula = "The kinetic energy (KE) is given by KE = 0.5 * mass * velocity^2"                                                              
final_answer(formula)                                                                                                                     
```                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                          
We must check instructions: Use only variable names we defined, call final_answer with answer variable.                                   
                                                                                                                                          
I'll produce code snippet and then output.                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                          
Thus I'll produce final answer accordingly. We'll produce answer in a "Code:" block.                                                      
                                                                                                                                          
I'll produce message accordingly.                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                          
I'll produce the final answer using our final_answer function.                                                                            
                                                                                                                                          
I'll now produce final answer as required.                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                          
I'll produce text: "The kinetic energy is given by KE = (1/2) m v^2."                                                                     
                                                                                                                                          
I'll produce code block with explanation and then call final_answer() accordingly. We'll produce output accordingly.</think>Thought: The  
formula for kinetic energy is commonly expressed as KE = ½ * mass * velocity², where "mass" represents the mass of the object and         
"velocity" its speed.
