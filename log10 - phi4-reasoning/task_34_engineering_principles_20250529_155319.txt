<think>User asks: "What is Ohm's law?" Our instructions: The task is "What is Ohm's law?". So we need to provide the answer. We'll use    
python code with final_answer, but also required to print a "Thought:" sequence and then "Code:" block as described.                      
                                                                                                                                          
So I'm going to produce code snippet that uses provided tools. It says we only have access to following tools: web_search(query),         
visit_webpage(url), wiki(query). Also instructions from previous examples. But in this case, the query is "What is Ohm's law?" This is a  
physics concept so we can provide answer.                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                          
We need to be careful with instructions. The task "What is Ohm's law?" I'm going to produce code snippet that uses final_answer with some 
description: "Ohm's Law states that the current passing through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage    
across the two points, and inversely proportional to the resistance." More precisely, it's V = IR. But careful: It's a formula: V=IR.     
                                                                                                                                          
I will produce code snippet: We'll not use any tool calls because the knowledge is available in my own memory (but instructions says we   
need to call a tool if needed? Actually instructions say we are allowed to use our internal memory, but for this question I don't need    
web_search or wiki maybe. But instructions say always include "Thought:" and then code block with triple quotes.                          
                                                                                                                                          
I'll produce code snippet in python:                                                                                                      
```                                                                                                                                       
final_answer("Ohm's Law states that the current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the 
two points, and inversely proportional to the resistance. Mathematically, it is expressed as V = I × R.")                                 
```                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                          
Yes. But instructions say: "Always use 'Thought:' then 'Code:' with python code block."                                                   
                                                                                                                                          
I'll produce answer accordingly.                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                          
I must not output markdown formatting? No, instructions says by default do not use markdown formatting except if requested. But the       
instructions said we should produce output as final answer. I will produce:

The user message is referencing the previous code block that I sent? It said our output includes error. The instructions are similar with 
"Call id: call_1" and we see error details that say "Code parsing failed on line 4 due to SyntaxError: unterminated string literal." The  
instructions now ask: "Now let's retry: take care not to repeat previous errors! If you have retried several times, try a completely      
different approach."                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                          
So user instructs to retry the code block for providing explanation of Ohm's Law with new attempt. We need to generate a corrected version
that doesn't repeat error.                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                          
We must produce "Thought:" sequence and then produce a "Code:" block following instructions. The previous error message was due to        
unterminated string literal in our code snippet. Possibly we have too many escapes or not properly using triple quotes.                   
                                                                                                                                          
Let's check the earlier generated snippet:                                                                                                
```                                                                                                                                       
final_answer("Ohm's law states that the current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the 
two points, and inversely proportional to the resistance. Mathematically, it is expressed as V = I × R.")                                 
```                                                                                                                                       
But in this version we have double quotes: "Ohm's Law states ..." and inside string "Ohm's" which uses an apostrophe. But that is allowed 
in Python if you use double quotes outside and then apostrophe doesn't need escaping. But possibly the code block formatting was not      
correct. The error message says it might be due to "Code parsing failed on line 4 due to: SyntaxError". Possibly because we are missing   
the triple backticks.                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                          
Wait, the previous version: It said:
