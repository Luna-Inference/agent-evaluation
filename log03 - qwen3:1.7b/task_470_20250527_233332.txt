<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking for the average lifespan of an elephant. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have. The available 
tools are web search, visiting webpages, and final answer. So maybe I should use the web search function to look up the average lifespan of elephants.
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I should perform a web search for "average lifespan of an elephant". The search results will give me the relevant information. Once I get the  
data, I can extract the average lifespan from the results and then use the final answer tool to present it.                                           
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the user might expect a specific number, like 50 years or something. But I need to make sure I get the correct figure from a reliable source.   
Let me check the search results. If the search returns something like "Elephants live up to 60 years in captivity" or similar, then that's the number.
But I should verify the source to ensure accuracy.                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                      
Alternatively, maybe the search results have different numbers based on species. For example, African elephants might live longer than Asian ones. But
the question is about the average, so maybe it's a general figure. I need to make sure the answer is accurate.                                        
                                                                                                                                                      
Once I have the data, I can compute the average lifespan and present it. Let me write the code to perform the search and then extract the answer.     
</think>
