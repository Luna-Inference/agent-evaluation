<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Denmark. I need to find that out. Let me think about the tools I have.                                    
                                                                                                                                                      
Hmm, the available tools are web search, visiting web pages, and final answer. So maybe I can use the web search function to look up the capital of   
Denmark. The question is straightforward. I'll perform a web search with the query "capital of Denmark" and then retrieve the top result. Once I get  
the answer, I can present it using the final_answer tool.                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the user might want the most recent information. So I should make sure the search is up to date. Let me structure the code: use the web_search  
function with the query, then process the result. If the result is a string, I can print it and then use final_answer to give the answer. Let me check
if there are any other steps needed. No, it's simple. So the code would be something like:                                                            
                                                                                                                                                      
web_search("capital of Denmark")                                                                                                                      
print(result)                                                                                                                                         
final_answer(result)                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                      
But I need to make sure the tools are called correctly. The web_search returns the top results, which should be the capital. Let me execute this.     
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the capital of Denmark and then return the final answer.                                              
Code:
