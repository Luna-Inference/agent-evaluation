<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Andorra. Let me think about how to approach this.                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I know that Andorra is a small country in Europe, and its capital is Andorra la Vella. But I need to confirm this accurately. Since the user might expect a precise       
answer, I should verify it using a reliable source.                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Looking at the tools available, the web_search function can be used to look up the capital of Andorra. The query should be straightforward: "capital of Andorra". Let me check if
there's any need for additional steps, like translating the question, but since the question is in English, no translation is needed here.                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll use the web_search tool with the query "capital of Andorra" to get the top results. Then, I can parse the first result to extract the capital name. If the search returns   
the correct information, I can directly provide the answer. If not, maybe I need to search again, but given that Andorra's capital is well-known, it's likely the first result   
will have the correct information.                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So the steps are: perform a web search for the capital of Andorra, retrieve the result, and extract the capital name as the answer.                                              
</think>
