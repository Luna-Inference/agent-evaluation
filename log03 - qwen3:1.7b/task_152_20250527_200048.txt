Okay, the user is asking who discovered the theory of evolution. I need to figure out how to find the answer. Let me think about the tools available.                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I remember that there's a wiki tool that can be used to look up information. So I'll use the wiki function with the query "theory of evolution discoverer". That should   
give me the answer. But wait, I should check if there are multiple people involved or if it's a specific individual. The theory of evolution was developed by many scientists,   
but the most famous figure is Charles Darwin. However, the wiki might list the main contributors. Let me proceed with the search.                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll write a code snippet to use the wiki tool with the query. Then, I'll check the result and extract the answer. If the wiki returns multiple names, I'll need to determine the
most correct one. But for the purpose of this task, just get the primary discoverer.

Thought: I will use the `wiki` tool to find the discoverer of the theory of evolution.

Okay, the user is asking who discovered the theory of evolution. The previous attempt tried using the `wiki` tool but encountered an error because the tool wasn't allowed. Now, 
I need to find another way to get the answer without using the `wiki` function.                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Since the `wiki` tool isn't available, I'll have to rely on other methods. Maybe I can use web search results directly. The user's question is straightforward, so I can perform 
a web search for "who discovered the theory of evolution" and extract the answer from the results.                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll write code to perform a web search and then parse the results to find the answer. The answer is likely to be Charles Darwin, but I need to confirm from the search results. 
Let's proceed with the web search.

Okay, so the user asked who discovered the theory of evolution. The initial attempt used the wiki tool, but it wasn't allowed. Then, the code tried web_search, and the results  
showed that Charles Darwin is mentioned multiple times as the main figure behind the theory. The search results mention his book "On the Origin of Species" and his theory of    
evolution by natural selection. Even though the search results list other scientists like Alfred Russel Wallace, the primary discoverer is clearly Charles Darwin. The code      
extracted the answer from the web search results, and the observation shows the result contains the information about Darwin. Since the user's question is straightforward, the  
answer is Charles Darwin. The code didn't need to do any further steps because the answer was directly retrieved from the web search. So, the final answer should be Charles     
Darwin.

Okay, so the user asked who discovered the theory of evolution. The initial attempt used the wiki tool, but it wasn't allowed. Then, the code tried web_search, and the results 
showed that Charles Darwin is mentioned multiple times as the main figure behind the theory. The search results mention his book "On the Origin of Species" and his theory of 
evolution by natural selection. Even though the search results list other scientists like Alfred Russel Wallace, the primary discoverer is clearly Charles Darwin. The code 
extracted the answer from the web search results, and the observation shows the result contains the information about Darwin. Since the user's question is straightforward, the 
answer is Charles Darwin. The code didn't need to do any further steps because the answer was directly retrieved from the web search. So, the final answer should be Charles 
Darwin.

Okay, the user is asking who discovered the theory of evolution. The previous attempts tried using the wiki tool and web search, but there were errors. The correct approach is  
to use the web search result directly. The answer is clearly Charles Darwin. The code should be simplified to just final_answer with the answer. The user's previous code had a  
regex error, but the correct code is straightforward. So, the final answer is Charles Darwin.

to use the web search result directly. The answer is clearly Charles Darwin. The code should be simplified to just final_answer with the answer. The user's previous code had a 
regex error, but the correct code is straightforward. So, the final answer is Charles Darwin.
                It seems like you're trying to return the final answer, you can do it as follows:
                Code:
                ```py
                final_answer("YOUR FINAL ANSWER HERE")
                ```<end_code>
Make sure to provide correct code blobs.

Okay, the user is asking who discovered the theory of evolution. The previous attempts tried using the wiki tool and web search, but there were errors. The correct approach is 
to use the web search result directly. The answer is clearly Charles Darwin. The code should be simplified to just final_answer with the answer. The user's previous code had a 
regex error, but the correct code is straightforward. So, the final answer is Charles Darwin.
                It seems like you're trying to return the final answer, you can do it as follows:
                Code:
                ```py
                final_answer("YOUR FINAL ANSWER HERE")
                ```<end_code>
Make sure to provide correct code blobs.
