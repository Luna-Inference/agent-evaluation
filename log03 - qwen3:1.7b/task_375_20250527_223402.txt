<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Ukraine. I need to figure out how to get that information. Let me think about the tools available.        
                                                                                                                                                      
Hmm, the tools mentioned are web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer. So maybe I can use web_search with the query "capital of Ukraine" to find   
the answer. Alternatively, maybe the wiki tool could help, but the user didn't mention a wiki function. Let me check the rules again.                 
                                                                                                                                                      
The rules say to use the tools provided. The web_search function is available. So I should perform a web search for the capital of Ukraine. The code  
would be something like web_search("capital of Ukraine"). Then, once I get the result, I can use final_answer to present the answer.                  
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, in the previous examples, when the user asked about the population of cities, they used the search function and then compared the results. So   
here, the same approach applies. I'll call web_search with the query, get the result, and then output the answer.                                     
                                                                                                                                                      
I need to make sure that the code is correct. Let me write the code step by step. First, perform the web search, then process the result. Since the   
observation part is not available here, I'll assume that the web_search returns the correct information. Then, the final_answer will be the capital.  
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the capital of Ukraine and then return the final answer.                                              
Code:
