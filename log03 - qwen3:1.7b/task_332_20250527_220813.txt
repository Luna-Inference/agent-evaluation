<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, let's tackle the question: "Who discovered the law of conservation of parity?"                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I need to recall what the law of conservation of parity is. From what I remember, parity conservation is a principle in physics, specifically in particle physics, which  
states that certain interactions should conserve parity. However, this principle was later shown to be violated by the weak interaction, as demonstrated by the discovery of the 
neutral current and the subsequent experiments.                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
But the question is about who discovered this law. I think the law of conservation of parity was proposed by J. C. Slater in 1940. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's   
related to the work of other physicists. Alternatively, it might be connected to the work of Wolfgang Pauli or others.                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Since I need to find the correct answer, I should use the available tools. The tools here are web_search and visit_webpage. So I should perform a web search to find the answer. 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Let me structure the steps:                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Use web_search with the query "who discovered the law of conservation of parity" to find the source.                                                                          
2. Analyze the search results to determine the correct answer.                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll start by conducting the web search.                                                                                                                                         
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web search tool to find the answer to the question about who discovered the law of conservation of parity.

Chien-Shiung Wu, after whom the Wu experiment is named, designed the experiment and led the team that carried out the test of the conservation of parity in 1956.. The Wu 
experiment was a particle and nuclear physics experiment conducted in 1956 by the Chinese American physicist Chien-Shiung Wu in collaboration with the Low Temperature Group of 
the US National Bureau of Standards. [1]

By this point Wu had, amongst other things, worked on the Manhattan project and disproved the hypothetical 'law of conservation of parity', changing the face of physics - and 
the world - forever. Born near Shanghai, Wu travelled to America to study for her PhD and never returned to China to work. She became a key member of the Manhattan ...

The law of conservation of parity arose from the symmetry between the left and right hands. In 1848 Louis Pasteur discovered, almost by sheer luck, the property of optical 
isomerism. Two forms of the same chemical compound, isomers, were found to rotate polarized light in two different directions --- one to the left, the other to the right ...

They discovered particles which had the same masses, lifetimes and scattering behaviors, but which decayed differently, proving that the fundamental and supposedly absolute law 
of parity conservation can be violated. ... Because of this, the law of parity conservation required that these otherwise similar particles be considered different from ...

[Experiment in Physics > Appendix 1: The Discovery of Parity ...](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/physics-experiment/app1.html)
The episode was that of the discovery that parity, mirror-reflection symmetry or left-right symmetry, is not conserved in the weak interactions. (For details of this episode see
Franklin (1986, Ch. 1)). Parity conservation was a well-established and strongly-believed principle of physics.

[The Fall of Parity | NIST](https://www.nist.gov/pml/fall-parity)
They constructed their theories so as to ensure that the corresponding mathematical property, called parity, remains unaltered - is conserved - in all subatomic processes. Thus 
this experiment brought about the fall of parity from its exalted position alongside such well conserved physical quantities as energy, momentum, and electric charge.

[17 Symmetry and Conservation Laws - The Feynman Lectures on Physics](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/III_17.html)
You look at the whole thing—including the photon—after the emission; it will again have even parity (likewise if you start with odd parity). This principle is called the 
conservation of parity. You can see why the words "conservation of parity" and "reflection symmetry" are closely intertwined in the quantum mechanics.

[December 27, 1956: Fall of Parity Conservation](https://www.aps.org/apsnews/2001/12/fall-parity-conservation-1956)
Parity conservation implies that Nature is symmetrical and makes no distinction between right- and left-handed rotations, or between opposite sides of a subatomic particle. For 
example, two similar radioactive particles spinning in opposite directions about a vertical axis should emit their decay products with the same intensity upwards and ...

[Chien-Shiung Wu - The Glinda Factor](https://theglindafactor.com/chien-shiung-wu/)
The Conservation of Parity stated that identical particles will act the same, and that two physical systems will work as mirror images of each other. In general, atoms take the 
path of least resistance and had no tendency to spin either right or left. For years, the scientific community assumed that the Conservation of Parity applied in all ...

Okay, let's see. The question is asking who discovered the law of conservation of parity. From the web search results, I need to figure out who the discoverer is.               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Looking at the observations, the key points mention Chien-Shiung Wu in the context of the Wu experiment, which disproved parity conservation. The Wu experiment was conducted by 
Chien-Shiung Wu and her team. The results from the search show that she was involved in the experiment that demonstrated the violation of parity conservation. Additionally, the 
search results mention that she disproved the hypothetical law of conservation of parity.                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So, the answer should be Chien-Shiung Wu. The other sources mention her work in physics and her role in the Manhattan Project, but the specific discovery of the law of          
conservation of parity is attributed to her through the Wu experiment. Therefore, the final answer is Chien-Shiung Wu.

Wu.
