Okay, the user is asking for the chemical symbol of sulfur. I need to figure out what that is. From what I remember, sulfur is a nonmetal, and its symbol is S. But maybe I      
should verify this.                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the tools available are web_search and visit_webpage. So perhaps I should use web_search to look up the chemical symbols. Let me check.                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll use the web_search tool with the query "chemical symbol for sulfur". The result should give the correct answer. Once I get the result, I can extract the symbol and return  
it.                                                                                                                                                                              
</think>
