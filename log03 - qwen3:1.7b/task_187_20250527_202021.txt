<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the main ingredient in sushi. I need to figure out what that is. From what I know, sushi is typically made with rice, but maybe there are other     
ingredients depending on the type of sushi. For example, there's寿司 (sushi) made with vinegared rice, and then there's お漬物 (narezushi) which uses different ingredients.     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the question is general, so the answer might be rice. But I should verify. Maybe I should use a tool to search for the common ingredients in sushi. Let me check the       
available tools. There's a web search function. So I'll use that to find the answer.                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll perform a web search for "main ingredient in sushi" and get the top results. Then I can extract the information from the search results. If the search returns that rice is 
the main ingredient, that's the answer. If there's more context, like different types, I need to consider that. But the question is general, so the answer is likely rice.
