<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Nepal. Let me think about how to approach this.                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I know that the capital of Nepal is New Delhi. But maybe I should verify this using a reliable source. Since the user might want the most accurate information, I should  
use a web search to confirm.                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I can use the web_search tool to look up the capital of Nepal. The query would be something like "capital of Nepal". Let me check the results. If the search returns that New    
Delhi is the capital, then I can be confident in that answer.                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Alternatively, if there's a different result, I might need to check another source. But given that I'm familiar with this information, maybe the answer is straightforward.      
However, to ensure correctness, using the web_search tool is the best approach here.                                                                                             
</think>
