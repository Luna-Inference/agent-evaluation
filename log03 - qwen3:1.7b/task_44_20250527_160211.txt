<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user wants me to name a country that starts with 'Z'. Let me think about how to approach this.                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I need to find countries whose names start with the letter Z. The tools available include web search, which I can use to look up countries. The
web_search function can be used here. So I'll use the web_search tool with the query "countries starting with Z".                                     
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the user didn't specify any particular country, just to name one. So the search should return a list of countries starting with Z. Then, I can  
pick the first one from the results and return it.                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                      
I should check the search results to make sure. If the search returns multiple countries, I can choose the first one. If not, maybe try a different   
query. But since the user just wants any country starting with Z, the first result should suffice.                                                    
                                                                                                                                                      
So the code would be to perform the web search and then output the first result. Let me write that.                                                   
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the web search tool to find countries starting with 'Z' and return the first result.

<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, so the user asked for a country that starts with 'Z'. I used the web search tool to find such countries. The search results showed that Zambia  
and Zimbabwe are the two countries starting with Z. The observation from the code didn't list any specific countries, but the search results clearly  
mention Zambia and Zimbabwe.                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                      
Since the task is to name a country, either of these two would work. The user probably expects the first one mentioned in the search results. Let me  
check the search results again. The first link mentioned "Zambia and Zimbabwe" as the two countries. So I can pick Zambia as the answer.              
                                                                                                                                                      
I should confirm that Zambia is indeed a country starting with Z. Yes, it's a landlocked country in Southern Africa. So the final answer is Zambia.   
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: From the search results, the two countries starting with 'Z' are Zambia and Zimbabwe. The first one mentioned is Zambia. I will return Zambia
as the answer.
