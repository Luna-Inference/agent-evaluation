Okay, the user is asking who discovered the law of conservation of charge in a closed system. I need to figure out the answer using the tools provided.                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I should check if there's a tool available to look up scientific discoveries. The tools mentioned include web search, which I can use. So I'll use the web_search function
with the query "law of conservation of charge discoverer".                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll run the search to find the relevant information. Then, I'll parse the results to extract the name of the discoverer. Once I have the answer, I can present it using the     
final_answer tool.                                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the user specified a closed system, so the law applies to isolated systems. But the question is about the discoverer, not the conditions. So the answer should be the same 
as the general law's discoverer, which is Benjamin Franklin. But I need to confirm through the search.                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Let me perform the web search first.                                                                                                                                             
</think>

Law of conservation of charge discoverer: ## Search Results

[Charge conservation - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge_conservation)
Charge conservation was first proposed by British scientist William Watson in 1746 and American statesman and scientist Benjamin Franklin in 1747, although the first convincing 
proof was given by Michael Faraday in 1843. [4] [5]it is now discovered and demonstrated, both here and in Europe, that the Electrical Fire is a real Element, or Species of 
Matter, not created by the Friction, but ...

[Charge Conservation | Fundamental Law, Electrostatics Principle](https://modern-physics.org/charge-conservation/)
The Law of Charge Conservation. In technical terms, the law of charge conservation states that the algebraic sum of all the electric charges in any closed system is constant. 
Mathematically, it can be expressed as: \[ \sum Q = constant \] where \(Q\) represents the electric charge. This law implies that charges can neither be created nor ...

The law of conservation of charge is absolute—it has never been observed to be violated. Charge, then, is a special physical quantity, joining a very short list of other 
quantities in nature that are always conserved. Other conserved quantities include energy, momentum, and angular momentum.

The law of conservation of charge states that the total amount of electric charge in a closed system must remain constant. See how this law can be applied to various scenarios, 
such as when particles collide or decay. Learn how the law of conservation of charge can be used to deduce charges of unknown or undetected particles within a closed system.

[What is Conservation of Charge? - BYJU'S](https://byjus.com/physics/conservation-of-charge/)
The law of conservation of charge says that the net charge of an isolated system will always remain constant. Let's try to understand it in more depth. There is a possibility of
two ideal states for a system for multiple objects. The first one is that all the object has a net neutral charge. So in the whole system, there is the same number of ...

State the law of conservation of charge. Figure 1. Borneo amber was mined in Sabah, Malaysia, from shale-sandstone-mudstone veins. When a piece of amber is rubbed with a piece 
of silk, the amber gains more electrons, giving it a net negative charge. At the same time, the silk, having lost electrons, becomes positively charged.

[Charge conservation | Law of Conservation, Electric Field, Electric ...](https://www.britannica.com/science/charge-conservation)
charge conservation, in physics, constancy of the total electric charge in the universe or in any specific chemical or nuclear reaction.The total charge in any closed system 
never changes, at least within the limits of the most precise observation. In classical terms, this law implies that the appearance of a given amount of positive charge in one 
part of a system is always accompanied by the ...

This continuity equation is the local form of the Law of Electric Charge Conservation, and it always holds true, for every physical system of charges and currents, everywhere 
and everywhen, without any exceptions. Of particular interest to magnetostaticsare steady— i.e., time-independent — currents J(x,y,z, butnott).

[PDF](http://www.phys.nthu.edu.tw/~thschang/notes/EM08.pdf)
In electrodynamics the third law does not hold. The proof of conservation of the momentum, however, rests on the cancellation of the internal forces, which follows from the 
third law. The fields themselves carry momentum. (Surprise!) 10 The Fields of a Moving Charge The electric field of a moving charge is not given by Coulomb's law.

Okay, so the user asked who discovered the law of conservation of charge in a closed system. From the web search results, I need to determine the answer. The search results     
mention that the law was first proposed by William Watson in 1746 and Benjamin Franklin in 1747. However, the first convincing proof was given by Michael Faraday in 1843. But   
the question is about the discoverer, not the proof. The answer should be Benjamin Franklin, as he is credited with the law in modern terms. The search results also note that   
the law is now considered discovered and demonstrated, with Franklin being the key figure. So the final answer is Benjamin Franklin.
