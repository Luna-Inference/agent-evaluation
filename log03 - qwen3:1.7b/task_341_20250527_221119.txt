<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking who wrote "To the Lighthouse." Let me think about how to approach this.                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I need to find the author of the novel. Since I can use web search tools, I should perform a search for the book's title. The tools available include web_search, which   
can retrieve information. Let me use the web_search function with the query "Who wrote To the Lighthouse?".                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the user might expect a direct answer, but I should make sure to check reliable sources. The web_search tool will return the top results. I'll execute the search and then 
parse the results to find the author.                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Once I get the answer, I can present it as the final answer. Let me write the code to do that.                                                                                   
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the author of "To the Lighthouse."
