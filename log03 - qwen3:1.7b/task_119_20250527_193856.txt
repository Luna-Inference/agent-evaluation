Okay, the user is asking who painted "The Scream." I need to figure out the answer. Let me think about the tools I have. There's the web_search function, which can look up      
information. Since "The Scream" is a well-known artwork, I can use a web search to find the artist.                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I'll call the web_search tool with the query "Who painted The Scream?" The result should give me the answer directly. Once I get the information, I can extract the       
artist's name and present it as the final answer.
