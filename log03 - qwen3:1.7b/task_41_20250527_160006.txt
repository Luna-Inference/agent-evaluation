<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking who the author of 'The Hobbit' is. I need to figure out how to find this information. Let me think about the tools I have    
available.                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I remember that there's a tool called `wiki` which can search for information, and another tool called `web_search` which can perform searches 
on the web. Since the question is straightforward, maybe I can use the `wiki` tool to look up the author of 'The Hobbit'.                             
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the user's previous examples used `wiki` and `web_search` effectively. So I'll try using the `wiki` tool with the query "author of The Hobbit". 
Let me check if that's the right approach.                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                      
Alternatively, maybe using `web_search` with the query "The Hobbit author" would also work. But since the user might expect a direct answer, using the
`wiki` tool could be more efficient.                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                      
I should call the `wiki` function with the query parameter set to "author of The Hobbit". Then, the tool will return the result, which I can use to   
answer the question. If the wiki tool returns the correct information, I can then present that as the final answer. If not, maybe I need to do another
search, but given that this is a straightforward question, the wiki tool should handle it.                                                            
                                                                                                                                                      
So the steps are: call the `wiki` function with the appropriate query, retrieve the result, and then output the answer.

Okay, the user is asking for the author of "The Hobbit". Earlier, I tried using the `wiki` tool but got an error because the tool wasn't allowed. Now,
I need to find another way to get the answer without using the `wiki` function.                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                      
Since the previous approach didn't work, maybe I can use a web search instead. The `web_search` tool was mentioned in the earlier examples. Let me try
searching for "The Hobbit author" using the `web_search` function. That should retrieve the correct information.                                      
                                                                                                                                                      
I'll structure the code to call `web_search` with the query "The Hobbit author" and then print the result. Once I get the answer, I can put it in the 
final answer box.
