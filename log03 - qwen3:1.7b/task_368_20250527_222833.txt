Okay, the user is asking who discovered the law of conservation of momentum in relativity. Let me think about how to approach this.                   
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I know that the law of conservation of momentum in relativity was developed by Albert Einstein. But I need to confirm this. Maybe I should     
check some reliable sources or historical records. However, the tools available here are web search and wiki. Let me use the web search tool to find  
the answer.                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                      
So, I'll perform a web search for "law of conservation of momentum in relativity discoverer" to find the relevant information. Once I get the results,
I can extract the name and present it as the answer.

Note that we use \(u\) for velocity here to distinguish it from relative velocity \(v\) between observers. The factor \(\gamma\) that occurs here has 
the same form as the previous relativistic factor \(\gamma\) except that it is now in terms of the velocity of the particle \(u\) instead of the 
relative velocity v of two frames of reference.. With p expressed in this way, total momentum\(p_{tot ...

The change in vertical momentum of this particle is therefore $\Delta p' = 2m_v w\sqrt{1 - u^2/c^2}$ because, in accordance with our assumed law , the
momentum component is always the mass corresponding to the magnitude of the velocity times the component of the velocity in the direction of interest.
Thus in order for the total momentum to be ...

The reason why this is useful for us is that conservation of energy and conservation of momentum are now combined into a single law: the conservation 
of 4-momentum. Suppose N i bodies interact, resulting in N f bodies afterwards. Then, XN i j=1 p⃗init j = XN f j=1 p⃗final j, (7.13) where p⃗init j is
the initial 4-momentum of particle j ...

The law of conservation of momentum is valid for relativistic momentum whenever the net external force is zero. The relativistic momentum is where m 
is the rest mass of the object, u is its velocity relative to an observer, and the relativistic factor is ; At low velocities, relativistic momentum 
is equivalent to classical momentum.

First, we take a look at momentum and its conservation. Note that momentum itself is not of any special importance in classical mechanics. However, 
momentum conservation is a very important principle which one would certainly like to retain in special relativity. We now show that the law of 
conservation of momentum is inconsistent with special ...

Dale's answer describes nicely where momentum conservation comes from, but I thought it might be useful to emphasize that momentum need not be 
conserved in a relativistic model, just as it need not be conserved in a non-relativistic model. There's nothing about special (or indeed, general) 
relativity which requires spatial translation symmetry, and so the Noether current corresponding to that ...

The derivation of the functional form of the relativistic momentum of a particle has a history going back to Lewis and Tolman's paper of 1909, yet 
satisfactory presentations seem to be few in number. Careful examination of the several types of derivation shows that their shortcomings are 
avoidable and allows the presentation of exact and improved analyses.

In addition to the law of conservation of momentum, there is another interesting consequence of Newton's Second Law, to be proved later, but merely 
stated now. This principle is that the laws of physics will look the same whether we are standing still or moving with a uniform speed in a straight 
line.

Relativistic momentum is defined in such a way that the conservation of momentum will hold in all inertial frames. Whenever the net external force on 
a system is zero, relativistic momentum is conserved, just as is the case for classical momentum.
