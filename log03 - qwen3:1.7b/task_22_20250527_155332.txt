Okay, the user wants a short poem about the ocean. Let me think about how to approach this.                                                           
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I need to create a poem. Since the user didn't specify any particular style or theme, I'll go with a classic structure. Maybe four-line stanzas
with a rhyme scheme. Let's start with the first stanza about the ocean's vastness and depth.                                                          
                                                                                                                                                      
I should include imagery like waves, tides, sea creatures, and maybe the moon. Rhyming words could be 'waves' and 'sails', 'night' and 'light'.       
                                                                                                                                                      
Second stanza could talk about the ocean's secrets and mysteries. Words like 'whispers', 'depth', 'shadow', 'light'.                                  
                                                                                                                                                      
Third stanza might focus on the ocean's role in nature, like storms, currents, and the connection to life. Words like 'storms', 'currents', 'life',   
'breath'.                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                      
I need to make sure the lines flow naturally and the rhymes are consistent. Let me draft each stanza step by step, checking the rhythm and rhyme. Once
the poem is structured, I can finalize it.                                                                                                            
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will create a short poem about the ocean using simple rhyming lines and imagery.
