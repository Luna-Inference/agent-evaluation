Okay, I need to find out the main ingredient in stroopwafel. Let me think. Stroopwafel is a Dutch dessert, right? It's made with a chocolate layer and
a waffle. The main ingredients are probably the chocolate and the waffle. But maybe there's something else. Wait, the question is about the main      
ingredient, so maybe it's the chocolate. But I should check if there's a specific ingredient that's more prominent. Alternatively, maybe the waffle is
considered the main ingredient. Hmm. I need to verify this.                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                      
I should use a web search to find the ingredients. Let me use the web_search tool with the query "main ingredient in stroopwafel". That should give me
the top results. Once I get the information, I can determine the answer.

<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, so the user asked, "What is the main ingredient in stroopwafel?" Based on the web search results, I need to figure out the answer. Let me look  
through the search results again.                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                      
From the results, I see that different sources mention different ingredients. One source says the main ingredients are flour, butter, sugar, eggs, and
yeast. Another mentions the filling is made with keukenstroop (which is a type of sugar syrup), butter, sugar, and cinnamon. The waffle is made with  
flour, butter, sugar, eggs, and yeast.                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                      
But the question is about the main ingredient in the whole stroopwafel. The waffle is a separate component. The filling is another part. So, the main 
ingredient would be the waffle's ingredients, but maybe the filling? Wait, the question is phrased as "main ingredient in stroopwafel," which refers  
to the entire dessert.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                      
Looking at the recipes, the waffle is made with flour, butter, sugar, eggs, and yeast. The filling is made with keukenstroop, butter, sugar, and      
cinnamon. So the main ingredient in the waffle is flour, but the filling has sugar and butter. However, the question might be referring to the waffle 
itself. But the answer needs to be precise.                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                      
In the search results, the first recipe mentions "Waffle Cookies. 2 cups (250g) flour" which suggests the waffle is made primarily of flour. The      
filling is a separate component. So the main ingredient in the waffle is flour. But the answer might need to consider the entire stroopwafel. However,
the question is about the main ingredient in the stroopwafel, which is the combination of the waffle and the filling.                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
But the user might be looking for the main ingredient in the waffle part. Since the waffle is made with flour, that's the main ingredient. However,   
the filling has sugar and butter, but the waffle's main ingredient is flour. So the answer is flour. But I need to check if the search results mention
that.                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
Looking back, the first result says "Main ingredient in stroopwafel: Waffle Cookies. 2 cups (250g) flour" which implies the waffle is made with flour.
So the main ingredient is flour. But the answer might need to be more precise. Alternatively, the filling's main ingredient is sugar, but the waffle's
main ingredient is flour. So the answer is flour.                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                      
But the search results also mention the filling is made with sugar syrup, which is a type of sugar. However, the waffle's main ingredient is flour. So
the answer is flour. Therefore, the main ingredient in stroopwafel is flour.
