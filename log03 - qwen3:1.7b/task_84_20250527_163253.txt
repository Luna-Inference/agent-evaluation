<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking for the main ingredient in sushi. I need to figure out what that is. From what I remember, sushi is typically made with rice,
but I should verify this.                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I should check if there's a tool available to look up this information. The available tools are web_search and visit_webpage. Let me use       
web_search with the query "main ingredient in sushi".                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the user might be looking for the primary component, which is rice. But maybe there's a common misconception. For example, some people think    
it's fish, but the main ingredient is indeed the rice. However, to be accurate, I should confirm via a search.                                        
                                                                                                                                                      
So, I'll perform a web search for the main ingredient in sushi. The results should clarify that rice is the main component. Then, I can provide the   
answer based on that information.                                                                                                                     
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the main ingredient in sushi.
