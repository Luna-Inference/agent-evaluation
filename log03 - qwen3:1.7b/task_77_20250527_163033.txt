<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Russia. I need to find that out. Let me think about the tools I have. There's the wiki tool, which can    
retrieve information about the pope's age, but maybe that's not relevant here. Wait, the user is asking about Russia's capital. So perhaps the wiki   
tool can be used here. Let me check the available tools again.                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                      
The tools available are web_search, visit_webpage, final_answer, and wiki. The wiki tool's query is "current pope age", but maybe I can use the wiki  
tool with a different query. Alternatively, maybe the web_search tool can be used with the query "capital of Russia".                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
I should use the web_search function with the query "capital of Russia" to get the top results. Then, extract the capital from the search results.    
Since the user wants the answer, I can then use the final_answer tool to present the result.                                                          
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the user's question is straightforward. The capital of Russia is Moscow. But I need to confirm this through the tools. Let me proceed step by   
step.                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
First, perform a web search for "capital of Russia". Then, parse the results to find the capital. However, the tools don't allow me to parse the web  
search results directly. So, I'll have to assume that the web_search function returns the correct information, and then use final_answer to output the
result.                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                      
Alternatively, maybe the wiki tool can be used with a query like "capital of Russia". But the previous examples used the wiki tool for specific       
questions, like the pope's age. Let me try that.                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                      
So, the code would be:                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                      
pope_age_wiki = wiki(query="capital of Russia")                                                                                                       
print("Pope age as per wikipedia:", pope_age_wiki)                                                                                                    
pope_age_search = web_search(query="capital of Russia")                                                                                               
print("Pope age as per google search:", pope_age_search)                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
But wait, the wiki tool's query was for the pope's age. If I use the same tool for the capital, maybe it's not relevant. However, the user might      
expect the answer to be Moscow. But since the tools are not sure, I need to proceed.                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                      
Alternatively, maybe the web_search tool can return the correct information. Let's proceed with the web_search.                                       
                                                                                                                                                      
So, the code would be:                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                      
result = web_search(query="capital of Russia")                                                                                                        
final_answer(result)                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                      
But the web_search returns a string, which is the top result. For example, if the search returns "The capital of Russia is Moscow.", then the answer  
is Moscow.                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                      
Therefore, the code would be:                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                      
result = web_search(query="capital of Russia")                                                                                                        
final_answer(result)                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                      
But I need to make sure that the web_search returns the correct answer. Since the user is asking a factual question, the answer is known, but the     
tools might not provide it directly. However, the assistant is allowed to use the tools to find the answer.                                           
                                                                                                                                                      
So, the final answer would be the result of the web_search.                                                                                           
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the capital of Russia and then return the final answer.
