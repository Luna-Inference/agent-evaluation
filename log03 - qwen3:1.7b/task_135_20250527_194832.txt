<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Switzerland. I need to find that out. Let me think about the tools I have. There's the web_search function, which can perform a      
search. Since the capital of Switzerland is a well-known fact, maybe a simple web search would work. I can use the web_search tool with the query "capital of Switzerland". Then,
I can retrieve the result and extract the answer.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the tools mentioned include web_search and visit_webpage. But the user didn't provide a specific URL, so I can't use visit_webpage. The web_search function should handle  
the query. Let me check the example tasks. In the previous examples, when the user asked about the pope's age, they used the wiki tool. But here, maybe web_search is sufficient.
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So, the plan is to use web_search with the query "capital of Switzerland" and then get the top result. The answer should be the capital, which is Bern. But I need to make sure  
the search returns that. Let me write the code: call web_search with the query, then print the result. Then, extract the capital from the result. Alternatively, if the search   
returns a list, pick the first item. But since the user expects a direct answer, maybe the first result is enough.                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I should code that. Let's proceed.                                                                                                                                               
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the capital of Switzerland and then extract the answer from the search results.
