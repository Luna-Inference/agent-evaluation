<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of South Korea. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have.                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I can use the web search tool to look up the capital. The previous examples show that when someone asks for a factual answer like the pope's age, they use the wiki tool. 
But here, the question is straightforward. The capital of South Korea is Seoul. But maybe I should verify it through a web search to ensure accuracy.                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the user might expect me to use a specific tool. Let me check the available tools again. The tools include web_search and visit_webpage. So I can use web_search with the  
query "capital of South Korea" to get the top results. Then, extract the capital from the search results.                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Alternatively, maybe the wiki tool could work, but since the user didn't mention it, I'll go with web_search. Let me structure the code: perform a web search, get the result,   
and then parse it to find the capital. But how to handle the output? The previous examples show that the web_search returns a string, which I can then process.                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So the code would be something like:                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
result = web_search("capital of South Korea")                                                                                                                                    
print(result)                                                                                                                                                                    
Then, find the capital in the result. But since the user wants the answer, I need to extract it. However, the code needs to be written in Python, and the output should be the   
final answer.                                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the user's task is to provide the answer, so after getting the search result, I can split the string to find the capital. For example, if the search result says "Seoul is 
the capital of South Korea.", then the answer is Seoul.                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
But how to handle the parsing? The previous examples show that when the search returns a string, the assistant uses print() to save important information. So maybe in the code, 
after getting the result, I can check for the capital in the string.                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So the code steps:                                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Use web_search with the query "capital of South Korea".                                                                                                                       
2. Extract the capital from the search result.                                                                                                                                   
3. Use final_answer to return the capital.                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
But I need to make sure that the code is correct. Let me write the code accordingly.                                                                                             
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web search tool to find the capital of South Korea and then extract the answer from the search results.                                                  
Code:
