Okay, the user is asking who discovered the law of radioactive decay. I need to figure out the answer. Let me think.                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I remember that the law of radioactive decay is related to radioactivity. The key figure here is Ernest Rutherford. But wait, I should verify. The law of radioactive     
decay was formulated by Pierre Curie and Antoine Becquerel, but maybe they were part of the discovery. Wait, actually, the law of radioactive decay is often attributed to the   
French physicist Antoine Becquerel, but I think it was more accurately described by the Curie sisters. Wait, no, the law of radioactive decay is a fundamental principle in      
nuclear physics. The actual discoverer might be Henri Becquerel, but I'm a bit confused here. Let me check.                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the law of radioactive decay states that the rate of decay is proportional to the number of radioactive atoms present. This was established by Pierre and Marie Curie, but 
they also discovered the phenomenon of radioactivity. However, the specific law might be attributed to them. But I need to be precise. Alternatively, the law was formulated by  
the Curie family. But the question is about who discovered the law. So the answer is Pierre and Marie Curie. But I should confirm.                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Alternatively, maybe it's Antoine Lavoisier, but that's not related. Wait, no, the law of radioactive decay is a specific law in nuclear physics. The discoverers are Pierre and 
Marie Curie. So the answer is Pierre and Marie Curie. But I need to make sure. Let me think if there's any other key figure. Oh, maybe it's the Curie sisters. So the answer is  
Pierre and Marie Curie. Therefore, the final answer should be that they discovered it.                                                                                           
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I need to find the discoverer of the law of radioactive decay. The law is a fundamental concept in nuclear physics, and the key figures are Pierre and Marie Curie.     
However, to confirm, I will use the `wiki` tool to retrieve the correct information.

Okay, the user is asking who discovered the law of radioactive decay. My initial thought was to use the wiki tool, but the system reported that 'wiki' is not allowed. So I need 
to find another way to get the correct information without using external tools.                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I remember that the law of radioactive decay was formulated by Pierre and Marie Curie. They discovered radioactivity and developed the law. However, to confirm, I should check  
reliable sources. Since the wiki tool isn't available, I'll rely on my existing knowledge. The answer is Pierre and Marie Curie. But I should make sure there's no confusion with
other scientists. The law is often attributed to them, so the final answer is Pierre and Marie Curie.

knowledge.
