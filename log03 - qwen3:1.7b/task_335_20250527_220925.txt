<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking who wrote the book "White Fang". I need to find the author of this classic novel. Let me think about how to approach this.                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I can use the web search tool to look up the book's information. The query should be straightforward. Maybe something like "Who wrote White Fang?".                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the tools available are web_search and visit_webpage. So I should call web_search with the query. Let me check if there's any specific information I need to consider. The 
user might expect a direct answer, but I should make sure to get the correct source.                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll perform the search and get the top results. Then, I can parse the results to find the author. If the search returns the author's name, I can immediately answer. If not,    
maybe I need to look into more details. But for now, let's proceed with the search.                                                                                              
</think>
