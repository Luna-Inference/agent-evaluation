<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, I need to find out who the author of 'The Divine Comedy' is. Let me think about how to approach this.                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I remember that 'The Divine Comedy' is a famous literary work by Dante Alighieri. But maybe I should verify this. Since the user might want a reliable source, I should   
use a tool to confirm. The available tools are web search and wiki. Let me use the web search first to check the current information.                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll perform a web search for the author of 'The Divine Comedy'. The query should be straightforward. Then, I can check the results to confirm the author's name. If the search  
returns the correct information, I can be sure. If not, maybe I need to use the wiki tool. But given that Dante Alighieri is well-known, the web search should suffice.          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So the steps are: use web_search with the query "author of The Divine Comedy", then check the results. If the result confirms it, I can proceed to answer.                       
</think>
