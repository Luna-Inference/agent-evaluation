<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of the Philippines. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have.                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The available tools are web_search and visit_webpage. Maybe I can use web_search with the query "capital of Philippines". Let me check if that's straightforward.                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the user might expect a direct answer. But since I can't browse the web directly here, I need to use the tools. So I'll perform a web search for the capital of the        
Philippines.                                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll write a code snippet using the web_search function with the query "capital of Philippines". Then, I'll retrieve the result and print it. Finally, I'll use the final_answer 
tool to present the answer.                                                                                                                                                      
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the capital of the Philippines.
