<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking for the official language of Brazil. Let me think about how to approach this.                                                
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I know that Brazil has Portuguese as its official language. But maybe I should verify this. Sometimes there might be variations or other       
languages spoken in different regions. However, the primary language is Portuguese. Let me check if there's any need for a web search here.           
                                                                                                                                                      
The tools available include web_search and visit_webpage. So perhaps I should use web_search to confirm. The query would be "official language of     
Brazil". Let me perform that search.                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                      
Once I get the results, I can extract the information. The top result might state that Portuguese is the official language. Alternatively, if there's 
a mention of other languages, like Spanish or other regional languages, I need to confirm if they are official. But generally, Portuguese is the      
official language of Brazil.                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, but the user might be looking for the primary language. So even if there are other languages spoken, the official language is Portuguese. So the
answer should be Portuguese. However, to be thorough, I should check the search results to make sure there's no conflicting information.              
                                                                                                                                                      
So the steps would be: perform a web search for "official language of Brazil", parse the results to find the correct answer, and then provide that as 
the final answer.                                                                                                                                     
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the official language of Brazil and then return the result.
