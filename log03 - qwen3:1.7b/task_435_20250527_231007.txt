<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Germany. I need to find that out. Let me think about the tools I have.                                    
                                                                                                                                                      
Hmm, the available tools are web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer. Since the question is straightforward, maybe a web search would work. I can 
use the web_search function with the query "capital of Germany".                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, but maybe I should check if there's a specific tool for geographical information. However, the tools provided don't include a specific geography
API. So I'll proceed with the web_search.                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                      
I'll run the search and get the top result. Then, I can extract the capital from the first result. Let me write the code for that.

Okay, so the user asked for the capital of Germany. I used the web_search tool with the query "capital of Germany". The observation showed multiple   
results, but the first one from Wikipedia says Berlin is the capital. The other results mention Berlin as the capital after reunification. The answer 
is clearly Berlin. I need to extract that from the search results.                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the code printed "Capital of Germany: ## Search Results" followed by links. The first relevant result is from Wikipedia, stating Berlin is the  
capital. So the answer is Berlin. I should confirm that in the final answer.
