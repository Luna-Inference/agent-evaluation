Okay, the user is asking for the chemical symbol of terbium. Let me think about how to approach this.                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I know that chemical symbols are usually abbreviations of the element's name. Terbium is a rare earth element. From what I recall, the symbol  
for terbium is Tb. But I should verify this to be sure.                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                      
Since I can use web search tools, I should perform a search to confirm the correct symbol. The tool 'web_search' can be used with the query "chemical 
symbol for terbium".                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                      
Once I get the result, I can extract the symbol from the top search result. Then, I can use the 'final_answer' tool to provide the answer.
