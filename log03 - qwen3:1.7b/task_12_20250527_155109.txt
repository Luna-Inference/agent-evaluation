Okay, the user is asking who the first person to walk on the moon was. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools available. The   
previous examples used web search and wiki queries. Since this is a historical question, a web search would be appropriate.                           
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I should use the web_search tool with the query "first person to walk on the moon". The previous observation showed that the answer was Neil   
Armstrong. But to be sure, maybe check a reliable source. However, the tools here don't have a specific wiki tool, but the web_search can retrieve the
top results.                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                      
So the code would be to perform a web search for the query and then extract the answer. Let me write the code accordingly.                            
</think>
