<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking for the chemical symbol of tellurium. Let me think about how to approach this.                                               
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I know that chemical symbols are usually one or two letters. Tellurium is a chemical element, so its symbol is something I should recall. But  
maybe I should verify it to be sure. Wait, the user might expect the symbol to be Te, but I should check if there's any other possible symbol or if   
there's a different way to represent it.                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Since I can use the tools provided, maybe I can use the 'wiki' tool to look up the chemical symbol of tellurium. The wiki tool would retrieve         
information about the element, including its symbol. Let me try that.                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
So, I'll call the wiki function with the query "chemical symbol of tellurium" to get the correct symbol. Then, I can extract the symbol from the      
result and provide it as the answer.                                                                                                                  
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the `wiki` tool to look up the chemical symbol of tellurium.

Okay, the user is asking for the chemical symbol of tellurium. Earlier, I tried using the wiki tool but got an error because the function wasn't      
allowed. Now I need to find another way to get the answer without using the wiki tool.                                                                
                                                                                                                                                      
I remember that tellurium is a chemical element, and its symbol is Te. But maybe I should confirm this through a different method. Since the wiki tool
isn't working, perhaps I can use a web search to find the symbol. Let me try the web_search tool with the query "chemical symbol tellurium" to        
retrieve the information.                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                      
Once I get the result, I can extract the symbol from the search results and provide the answer. Let's proceed with this approach.
