<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of the United Arab Emirates. Let me think about how to approach this.                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I know that the capital of the UAE is Dubai. But I should verify this using a reliable source. Since the tools available include web search, I can use the web_search     
function to check the current information.                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So, I'll perform a web search for "capital of United Arab Emirates" to confirm. The search results should provide the correct answer. Once I get the result, I can extract the   
capital from the response and return it as the final answer.                                                                                                                     
</think>
