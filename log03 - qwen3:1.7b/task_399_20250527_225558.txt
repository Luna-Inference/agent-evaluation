Okay, the user is asking for the capital of North Macedonia. Let me think about how to approach this.                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I need to find the capital city of North Macedonia. I remember that North Macedonia is a country in Europe, and its capital is Skopje. But     
maybe I should verify this to be sure.                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                      
Since the user might want an accurate answer, I should use a reliable method. The available tools include web search and visiting webpages. So I can  
perform a web search to confirm the capital.                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                      
I'll use the web_search function with the query "capital of North Macedonia". Then, I can retrieve the results and extract the capital from the top   
result.                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the tools mentioned have a web_search function that returns the top results. So I'll call web_search with the query, then parse the first result
to find the capital.                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                      
Once I have the capital, I can use the final_answer function to present it. Let me make sure the code is correct. The code should search for the      
capital, extract the information, and then output the answer.                                                                                         
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the web search tool to find the capital of North Macedonia.
