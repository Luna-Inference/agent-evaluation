Okay, the user is asking who discovered the law of conservation of energy in thermodynamics. Let me think about how to approach this.                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I need to find the answer. The law of conservation of energy is a fundamental principle in physics. I remember that it's often attributed to James Prescott Joule, but I'm
not entirely sure. Maybe I should verify this.                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I can use the web search tool to look up the discoverer of the law of conservation of energy. Let me check the web search results.                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the user might expect the answer to be James Prescott Joule, but I should confirm. Let me perform a search to make sure.                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So, the plan is: use the web_search tool with the query "law of conservation of energy discoverer" to find the answer. Then, process the results to extract the name.

[Who Discovered the Law of Conservation of Energy? (Description)](https://thepowerfacts.com/who-discovered-the-law-of-conservation-of-energy/)
In 1845, German physician Julius Robert von Mayer discovered the law of conservation of energy while studying human metabolism. This discovery led to the development of the 
first law of thermodynamics. The law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, but it can be converted from one form to another.

[Conservation of energy - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_energy)
The law of conservation of energy states that the total energy of an isolated system remains constant; it is said to be conserved over time. [1] In the case of a closed system, 
the principle says that the total amount of energy within the system can only be changed through energy entering or leaving the system.Energy can neither be created nor 
destroyed; rather, it can only be transformed or ...

[Law of Conservation of Energy - Science Notes and Projects](https://sciencenotes.org/law-of-conservation-of-energy/)
The law of conservation of energy is a physical law that states that the total energy of an isolated system is a constant, although energy can change forms.In other words, 
energy is conserved over time. The law of conservation of energy is the first law of thermodynamics.French mathematician and philosopher Émilie du Châtelet first proposed and 
tested the law in the 18th century.

aboard a Dutch ship he discovered the law of conservation of energy, by a sudden intuition. This great discovery, comparable in its suddenness to a religious conversion, 
occurred while he was in the harbor of Surabaya (N. E. Java) in July I840. His whole life was henceforth devoted to the development and defense of

[James Prescott Joule | Biography & Facts | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/biography/James-Prescott-Joule)
James Prescott Joule (born December 24, 1818, Salford, Lancashire [now in Greater Manchester], England—died October 11, 1889, Sale, Cheshire) was an English physicist who 
established that the various forms of energy—mechanical, electrical, and heat—are basically the same and can be changed one into another.Thus, he formed the basis of the law of 
conservation of energy, the first law of ...

One would have thought that the conservation of energy was discovered from the conservation of mechanical energy, but that was not really the case. The conservation of 
mechanical energy has actually played only a very minor role. Carnot made the link between work and kinetic energy quite early, but it was not until the 1820s before this link 
...

Julius Mayer, a German physicist, was the first person to state the law of the conservation of energy, in an 1842 scientific paper. Mayer experimentally determined the 
mechanical equivalent of heat from the heat evolved in the compression of a gas (without appreciating that heat could be explained in terms of kinetic theory). ...

At almost the same time the discovery of a fixed numerical relation between heat and work was made by two very different men, Julius Robert Mayer (1814-1878) and James Prescott 
Joule (I818-I889). Mayer, a German physician on a Dutch.ship, dis- covered the law of conservation of energy by a sudden intuition.

[The Discovery of Energy Conservation: Mayer and Joule](https://galileo.phys.virginia.edu/classes/152.mf1i.spring02/MayerJoule.htm)
Mayer understood the sequence: a chemical reaction produces heat and work, that work can then produce a definite amount of heat. This amounted to a statement of the conservation
of energy. Sad to report, Mayer was not part of the German scientific establishment, and this ground-breaking work was ignored for some years. James Joule
