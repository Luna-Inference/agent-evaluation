Okay, the user is asking about the main ingredient in falafel. I need to figure out what the answer is. Let me think.                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I remember that falafel is a traditional Middle Eastern dish, usually made from chickpeas. But I should verify this. Maybe there are variations, but the main ingredient  
is typically chickpeas. However, I should check if there are other possible ingredients or if the question is more specific.                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Since I can use web search tools, I should perform a search to confirm. The tools available are web_search and visit_webpage. Let me use web_search with the query "main         
ingredient in falafel".                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the user might expect chickpeas, but maybe there's more to it. For example, sometimes they add onions or spices. But the main ingredient is usually the chickpeas. Let me  
check the results.                                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Once I get the search results, I can extract the main ingredient. If the search returns that chickpeas are the main ingredient, then that's the answer. If there's more          
information, I can note that. But based on my prior knowledge, chickpeas are the main ingredient. However, to be accurate, I should perform the search to confirm.
