<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, let's tackle the question: "Who wrote 'The Legend of Jubal'?"                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I need to find out the author of this book. The user hasn't provided any specific tools, but based on the previous examples, I can assume that 
tools like web_search or wiki might be available. Since the task is to find the author, I should use a web search to look up the book's information.  
                                                                                                                                                      
I'll start by using the web_search function with the query "The Legend of Jubal author". This will retrieve the top results. Then, I can parse the    
first result to find the author's name. If the search returns the author directly, I can extract that information. If not, maybe I need to look for   
additional sources or check the book's metadata.                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the user might expect a specific answer. Let me make sure to check the first result thoroughly. If the search returns the author's name, I can  
directly use that in the final answer. If not, perhaps there's a need to refine the search query or check other sources. But given the constraints,   
I'll proceed with the initial search and extract the author from the first result.                                                                    
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the web search tool to find the author of "The Legend of Jubal" and extract the information.
