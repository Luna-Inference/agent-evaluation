<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Egypt. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have.                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Hmm, the available tools are web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer. Since the question is straightforward, maybe a web search would work. I can use the web_search function
with the query "capital of Egypt".                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, but the user might expect a direct answer. Let me check if there's any need to visit a specific webpage. But since it's a simple question, a general web search should     
suffice. I'll proceed with that.                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So the code would be to call web_search with the query. Then, once I get the results, I can extract the capital from the first result. But according to the rules, I should not  
store variables unless necessary. So maybe just call the search and then use the final_answer with the result.                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the example in the previous task used print statements to capture outputs. So perhaps I should perform the search, get the result, and then use final_answer. Let me write 
the code accordingly.                                                                                                                                                            
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the `web_search` tool to find the capital of Egypt and then return the answer.
