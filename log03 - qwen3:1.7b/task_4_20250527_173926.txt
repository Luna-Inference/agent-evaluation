Okay, the user wants a one-sentence summary of Einstein's theory of relativity. Let me think about what key points I need to include.                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
The theory of relativity has two main parts: special and general. Special relativity deals with objects moving at constant speeds, especially near the speed of light, and       
introduces concepts like time dilation and length contraction. General relativity extends this by incorporating gravity, describing it as the curvature of spacetime caused by   
mass and energy.                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So, putting it all together, a concise summary would mention both theories, the key ideas, and the main consequence. Maybe something like: "The theory of relativity consists of 
two parts—special relativity, which describes the behavior of objects in inertial frames, and general relativity, which explains gravity as the curvature of spacetime."         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I should check if there's any specific detail the user wants, but since it's a one-sentence summary, keeping it general is best. Let me make sure the sentence is accurate and   
covers the main points without being too technical.                                                                                                                              
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will summarize the theory of relativity in one sentence by combining its key components: special and general relativity, their focus areas, and the main concept of   
spacetime curvature.
