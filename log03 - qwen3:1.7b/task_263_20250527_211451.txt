Okay, the user is asking who wrote "Ulysses". I need to figure out the answer. I remember that Ulysses is a novel by James Joyce. But maybe I should verify this using the tools 
provided.                                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I'll use the web search tool to check the author of Ulysses. The query should be "Ulysses author". Let me run that.
