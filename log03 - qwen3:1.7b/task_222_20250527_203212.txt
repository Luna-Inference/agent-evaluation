<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Jordan. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have. The available tools are web search, visiting webpages, 
and final answer. Since the question is straightforward, I can use a web search to find the capital.                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I'll use the web_search tool with the query "capital of Jordan". The result should give the answer directly. Once I get the result, I can extract the capital from the    
search results. Then, I'll use the final_answer tool to present the answer.
