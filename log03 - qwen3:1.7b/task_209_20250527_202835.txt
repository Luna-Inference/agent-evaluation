<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking who wrote "The Prince". I need to figure out how to find this information. Let me think about the tools available.                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I remember that the user has access to a search tool, which can be used to look up information. The tools mentioned include web_search and visit_webpage, which might help
retrieve the answer. Since the question is about a well-known book, I should use a search to find the author.                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I should start by using the web_search function with the query "Who wrote The Prince?". That should return the top results. Then, I can check the first result to find the       
author's name. If the search returns the correct information, I can extract the author from the result and present it as the final answer.                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the user's tools include a function called wiki, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here. However, since the question is about a book's author, a web search is more    
direct. Also, the previous examples used web_search, so I'll stick with that.                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So the steps are: perform a web search for the author of "The Prince", then extract the name from the result. The final answer will be the author's name.
