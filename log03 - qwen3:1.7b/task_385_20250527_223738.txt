<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking about the main ingredient in shopska salad. First, I need to figure out what "shopska salad" refers to. Since it's a specific
dish, maybe it's a regional or traditional salad in a particular country. The term "shopska" might be a variation or a specific name for a type of    
salad.                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                      
I should start by searching for information on shopska salad. Using the web_search tool with the query "shopska salad" could help find relevant       
sources. Once I have the results, I can analyze the information to determine the main ingredient.                                                     
                                                                                                                                                      
Looking at the search results, I need to check if there's a common ingredient mentioned. For example, if the search returns information about a       
specific salad like "shopska" in Hungary or another country, the main ingredient might be something like tomatoes, cucumbers, or a particular         
dressing.                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                      
After gathering the necessary information, I can compile the answer based on the findings. If the search results indicate that the main ingredient is 
tomatoes, then that's the answer. If there's more context, like a specific recipe or a common variation, that would guide the final answer.
