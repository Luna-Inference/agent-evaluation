<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Nauru. Let me think about how to approach this.                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I need to recall if I have any existing knowledge about the capital of Nauru. From what I remember, Nauru is a small island country in the Pacific Ocean. Its capital is  
Nay Pyi Taw, which is also the capital of the neighboring country, Timor-Leste. But I should verify this to be sure.                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Since the user is asking for an accurate answer, I should use a reliable method. The available tools include web search and visiting webpages. So, I can perform a web search to 
find the capital of Nauru.                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll use the web_search tool with the query "capital of Nauru". The result should provide the correct information. Once I get the answer, I can present it as the final answer.
