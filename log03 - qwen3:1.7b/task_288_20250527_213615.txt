<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Indonesia. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have.                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Hmm, the available tools are web search, visiting webpages, and final answer. So maybe I should use the web_search tool to look up the capital of Indonesia. The query would be  
"capital of Indonesia". Let me check if there's a direct way to get this information.                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, I can also use the visit_webpage tool to browse a specific webpage. But since the user didn't provide a specific URL, maybe a general search is better. The web_search     
function should return the top results. Once I get the result, I can extract the capital from the first result.                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So the steps would be: perform a web search for "capital of Indonesia", get the top result, and then parse that result to find the capital. Then, use the final_answer tool to   
present the answer.                                                                                                                                                              
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the capital of Indonesia and then extract the answer from the first result.
