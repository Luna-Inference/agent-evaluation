<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking about the main ingredient in risotto. I need to figure out what the answer is. From what I remember, risotto is a rice dish, typically made with Arborio
rice. But I should verify this.                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I should check if there's a reliable source or a way to confirm this. Since I can use the web search tool, I can perform a search to find information about the main      
ingredients of risotto. Let me use the web_search function with the query "main ingredient in risotto".                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Once I get the results, I can look for the most common answer. The answer is likely Arborio rice, but I need to make sure. If the search returns multiple sources, I should pick 
the most relevant one. If there's a specific mention, that's the answer. Then, I can use the final_answer function to present the result.
