Okay, the user is asking for the largest ocean on Earth. I need to figure out how to find that. From what I remember, the oceans are the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, and Arctic.  
But which is the largest?                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Hmm, I think the Pacific Ocean is the largest. But I should verify this. Maybe I can use a web search to check the current data. The user might want the most recent information,
so searching now would be best.                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll use the web_search tool with the query "largest ocean on Earth". Then, based on the results, I can determine the answer. If the search returns the correct information, I   
can state that the Pacific Ocean is the largest.                                                                                                                                 
</think>
