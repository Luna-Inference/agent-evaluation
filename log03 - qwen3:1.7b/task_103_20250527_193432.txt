<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Turkey. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have. The available tools are web_search and visit_webpage,  
which can retrieve information from the internet. Since the question is straightforward, I can use a web search to find the answer.                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I'll use the web_search function with the query "capital of Turkey". The result should give the answer directly. Once I get the search results, I can extract the capital 
from the first result. Then, I'll use the final_answer tool to present the answer.                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I need to make sure the search is accurate. The capital of Turkey is Ankara, but I should confirm via the search. Let's perform the search and then process the result.
