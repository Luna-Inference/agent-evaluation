Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Switzerland. I need to figure out how to get that information. Let me think about the tools I have        
available.                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                      
The tools mentioned are web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer. Since the user wants the capital, which is a straightforward fact, maybe a web   
search would work. But I should check if there's a direct way. However, the tools don't include a specific country capital database, so web_search is 
the way to go.                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                      
I should perform a web search for "capital of Switzerland" to get the top results. Then, extract the capital from the first result. Let me write the  
code for that.                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the user's previous examples used web_search with a query. So I'll use the web_search function with the query "capital of Switzerland". Then, in
the observation, I can check the result and finally answer with the capital.                                                                          
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the capital of Switzerland.
