<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Romania. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have. The available tools are    
web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer. Since the user is asking for a factual answer, web_search would be appropriate here.                     
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I should perform a web search for the capital of Romania. The query should be straightforward, like "capital of Romania". I'll use the         
web_search function with that query. Once I get the results, I need to extract the capital from the top search results.                               
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the tools don't have a specific function for extracting information from search results. So I'll have to rely on the web_search output. If the  
search returns a string with the answer, I can parse it. But since the user's example uses print statements, maybe the web_search returns the answer  
directly. Alternatively, maybe the web_search returns a list of results, and I need to check the first one.                                           
                                                                                                                                                      
Assuming that the web_search returns the answer directly, I can just print it and then use final_answer. Let me write the code: call web_search with  
"capital of Romania", then print the result, and finally answer with that result.                                                                     
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the capital of Romania and then return the answer.
