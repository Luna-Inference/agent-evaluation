Okay, the user is asking for the chemical symbol of radon. I need to figure out what that is. Radon is a chemical element, so its symbol is something I should know. But maybe I 
should verify it using a tool.                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Looking at the tools available, there's the wiki function. Let me check if that can provide the symbol. The wiki tool would probably give the chemical symbol for radon.         
Alternatively, maybe a web search would work. But since the user wants the answer, I should use the wiki tool first.                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the tools mentioned include web_search and wiki. Let me use the wiki function with the query "chemical symbol for radon". That should retrieve the correct information.    
Once I get the result, I can present it as the final answer.

Okay, the user is asking for the chemical symbol of radon. I tried using the wiki tool earlier, but there was an error because the tool wasn't allowed. Now I need to find       
another way to get the answer.                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Since the wiki tool isn't available, I'll have to use a different method. Maybe I can recall that radon is a noble gas and its symbol is Rn. But I should verify this.           
Alternatively, I can use a web search to find the correct symbol. Let me try the web_search tool with the query "chemical symbol for radon" to get the answer.                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So the plan is to perform a web search for the chemical symbol of radon and then return the result. I'll write the code to do that.
