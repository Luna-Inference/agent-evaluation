<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the chemical symbol of nickel. I need to figure out what that is. From what I remember, nickel is a metal used in various applications. The chemical
symbol for nickel is Ni. But wait, maybe I should verify this to make sure.                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Hmm, the tools available include web search and wiki. So perhaps I should use the web search tool to confirm. Let me think. The user might expect the answer to be Ni, but maybe 
there's a need to check a reliable source. Let me perform a web search for "chemical symbol for nickel" to ensure accuracy.                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll use the web_search function with the query "chemical symbol for nickel". Then, I can retrieve the result and check the symbol. If the result is Ni, then that's the answer. 
If not, maybe there's a different symbol, but I think Ni is correct. Let me proceed with the code.

[Nickel - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel)
Nickel is a chemical element; it has symbol Ni and atomic number 28. ... Nickel sulfides commonly exist as solid solutions with iron in minerals such as pentlandite and 
pyrrhotite with the formula Fe 9−x Ni x S 8 and Fe 7−x Ni x S 6, respectively. Other common Ni-containing minerals are millerite and the arsenide niccolite.

[Nickel | Definition, Properties, Symbol, Uses, & Facts | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/science/nickel-chemical-element)
Nickel, chemical element, ferromagnetic metal of Group 10 (VIIIb) of the periodic table, markedly resistant to oxidation and corrosion. Silvery white, tough, and harder than 
iron, nickel is widely familiar because of its use in coinage but is more important as the pure metal or in the form of alloys.
