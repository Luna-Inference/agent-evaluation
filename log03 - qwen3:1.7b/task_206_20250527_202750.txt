Okay, the user is asking who discovered the circulation of blood. I need to figure out the answer. Let me think about the history of this topic.                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I remember that the circulation of blood was a topic discussed by several scientists. The key figure here is William Harvey. He was an English physician who conducted           
experiments on animals, especially frogs, to understand the circulatory system. His work laid the foundation for modern physiology.                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
But wait, I should verify this. Maybe there's another name associated with this discovery. Let me check my knowledge. Harvey's book "Experientia Clinica" published in 1621      
detailed his findings. He demonstrated that blood circulates through the body in a closed system, which was a significant advancement over the earlier theory of the four humors.
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So the answer should be William Harvey. But I need to make sure there's no other contributor. I recall that there was a debate about this, but Harvey's experiments were crucial.
Therefore, the answer is William Harvey.
