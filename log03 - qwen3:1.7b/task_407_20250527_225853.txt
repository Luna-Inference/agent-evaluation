<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking who wrote the book "Romola". Let me think about how to approach this.                                                        
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I need to find out the author of "Romola". Since this is a literary work, maybe I can use a web search to look up the author. The tools        
available include web_search and visit_webpage. So I should perform a web search for the book's title.                                                
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the user might not know the exact title, but the book is "Romola" by Anna Seghers. But I need to confirm that. Let me use the web_search tool   
with the query "who wrote romola". That should return the author's name.                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Once I get the result, I can extract the author's name and present it as the answer. Let me write the code for that.                                  
</think>
