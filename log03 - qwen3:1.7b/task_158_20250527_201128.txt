Okay, the user is asking who discovered the structure of DNA. I need to figure out the answer. From what I remember, DNA's structure was discovered by James Watson and Francis  
Crick. But maybe I should verify this with some sources.                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I should use the web search tool to find the relevant information. Let me check the web search results. The top result mentions Watson and Crick. Another source might be 
a scientific article or a textbook. Wait, the user might want the exact names, so I should make sure to get the correct information.                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll perform a web search for "who discovered the structure of DNA" to confirm. Then, I can extract the names from the results. If the search returns the correct information, I 
can present the answer. If not, maybe there's a need to refine the search terms. But based on my knowledge, Watson and Crick are the correct answer. Let me proceed with the code
to perform the search and then retrieve the answer.                                                                                                                              
</think>
