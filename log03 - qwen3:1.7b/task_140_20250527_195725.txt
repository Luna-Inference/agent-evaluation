Okay, the user is asking who discovered insulin. I need to find the answer using the tools available. Let me think about the steps.                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I should use a search tool to find information about insulin discovery. The tools provided include web_search and visit_webpage. Since the question is straightforward, a 
web search should retrieve the necessary information.                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll use the web_search function with the query "who discovered insulin". The result will give me the answer. Once I get the result, I can extract the name of the discoverer and
present it as the final answer.                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I need to make sure the search is accurate. The answer should be the person whose name is associated with the discovery of insulin. Let me execute the code to perform the search
and then process the result.                                                                                                                                                     
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the answer to the question about who discovered insulin.
