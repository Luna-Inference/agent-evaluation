<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking who discovered the law of universal gravitation. I need to figure out the answer. From what I remember, Isaac Newton is the most famous physicist       
associated with this law. But I should verify this.                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I should use the web search tool to look up the history of the law of universal gravitation. Let me check the search results. The search should return information about  
the discoverer.                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the tools available include web_search and visit_webpage. So I can perform a web search with the query "who discovered the law of universal gravitation". Let me execute   
that.                                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Once I get the results, I need to parse them to find the correct answer. The search results might mention Newton, but maybe there's another name. For example, maybe it's someone
else like Kepler or Galileo. But I think Newton is the correct answer.                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Alternatively, maybe the search results mention that it was discovered by Newton in his book "Principia Mathematica". So, after checking the web search, I can confirm that the  
answer is Isaac Newton. Then, I can use the final_answer tool to provide the answer.                                                                                             
</think>

[Newton's law of universal gravitation - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_law_of_universal_gravitation)
Before Newton's law of gravity, there were many theories explaining gravity. Philosophers made observations about things falling down − and developed theories why they do - as 
early as Aristotle who thought that rocks fall to the ground because seeking the ground was an essential part of their nature. [6]Around 1600, the scientific method began to 
take root.
