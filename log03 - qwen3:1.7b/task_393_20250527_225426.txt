<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Let me think about how to approach this.                                          
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I need to recall if I have any tools that can help with this. The available tools are web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer. Since the   
user is asking for a factual answer, web_search might be the best option here.                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                      
I should use the web_search function with the query "capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina". Let me check if there's any need to visit a specific webpage.
The user didn't mention any particular source, so a general search should suffice.                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the tools don't have a built-in knowledge base for countries' capitals. So I need to rely on the web search results. Let me execute the search  
and get the top results.                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Once I get the results, I can parse them to find the capital. For example, if the search returns something like "Bosnia and Herzegovina's capital is  
Sarajevo", then the answer is Sarajevo.                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                      
I should make sure to use the correct parameters for the web_search function. The query should be straightforward. Let me write the code to perform   
the search and then extract the capital from the results.                                                                                             
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
