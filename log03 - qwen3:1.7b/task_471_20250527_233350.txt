<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking who composed the 'Four Seasons' by Antonio Vivaldi. I need to figure out how to find this information.                       
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I remember that the 'Four Seasons' is a famous violin concerto. The composer is Antonio Vivaldi, but maybe there's more to it. Wait, the       
question is asking who composed it, so the answer is Vivaldi. But maybe the user wants to confirm the details.                                        
                                                                                                                                                      
I should check if there's any confusion. For example, sometimes people might mix up the composers. But Vivaldi is the well-known composer of this     
piece. However, to be thorough, maybe I should verify using a search or a tool.                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                      
Looking at the tools available, there's a web_search function. So I can use that to look up the composer of the 'Four Seasons'. The query would be    
something like "Who composed the Four Seasons?".                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                      
I'll perform the search and get the result. If the result confirms Vivaldi, then I can proceed to answer. If there's any doubt, the search will       
clarify. But based on my knowledge, Vivaldi is the correct answer. However, to ensure accuracy, using the tool is the right approach.
