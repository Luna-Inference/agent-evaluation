<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking about the main ingredient in poi. I need to figure out what "poi" refers to here. From what I know, "poi" can stand for different things depending on   
the context. Commonly, it could be "personal organizer" or "point of interest," but in the context of food, it might refer to "pòtèt," which is a type of corn-based dish in     
French cuisine.                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Since the user is asking for the main ingredient, I should check if there's a specific context. If it's a food-related question, the main ingredient would be corn. However, if  
it's a different context, like a personal organizer, the answer would be different. But given the prevalence of "poi" in food contexts, I'll proceed with that.                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I need to verify this. Using the web search tool, I can look up "poi main ingredient" to confirm. Let me perform a web search to find the answer.
