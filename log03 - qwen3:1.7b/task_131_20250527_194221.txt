<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking who wrote "Crime and Punishment." I need to figure out the answer. Let me think.                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I remember that "Crime and Punishment" is a novel by Fyodor Dostoevsky. But maybe I should verify this. Since the user might be testing if I know the answer, or if       
there's any confusion. Wait, maybe there's a possibility of a different author? No, I think Dostoevsky is definitely the author. But to be thorough, perhaps I should use the web
search tool to confirm.                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So the steps would be: use the web search tool with the query "Who wrote Crime and Punishment?" to get the answer. Then return the final answer with the name of the author.
