<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking for the chemical symbol of europium. Let me think about how to approach this.                                                
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I know that chemical symbols are usually abbreviations of elements' names. Europium is a chemical element, so its symbol should be something   
like Eu. But I need to confirm this. Maybe I should check a reliable source or use a tool to look it up.                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Looking at the tools available, there's the 'wiki' function. I can use that to look up the chemical symbol of europium. The wiki tool would probably  
return the correct symbol. Alternatively, web search might also work. But since the user didn't specify, using the wiki tool seems straightforward.   
                                                                                                                                                      
So the plan is to use the wiki tool with the query "chemical symbol for europium" to get the correct symbol. Then, I can directly answer the user with
the result.                                                                                                                                           
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the `wiki` tool to look up the chemical symbol for europium.

Okay, the user is asking for the chemical symbol of europium. I tried using the wiki tool but got an error because the function isn't allowed. Let me 
think of another way.                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
Maybe I can recall that europium is a chemical element with the symbol Eu. But I need to make sure. Since the wiki tool isn't available, perhaps I can
use a web search instead. Let me check the allowed tools again. The user's tools include web_search and visit_webpage. So I can use web_search with   
the query "chemical symbol for europium".                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                      
I'll write code to perform a web search for the symbol and then return the result. That should work without using the forbidden function.
