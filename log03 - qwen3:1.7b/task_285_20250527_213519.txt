<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Malaysia. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have.                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I can use the web search tool to look up the capital of Malaysia. The web_search function can be used here. The query would be "capital of Malaysia". Let me check if     
there's any existing data or if I need to perform a search.                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, I should make sure to use the correct tool. The user provided some functions, so I can use web_search with the query. Let me write the code to perform the search.         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Once I get the results, I can extract the capital from the top search result. The observation will show the results, and then I can determine the answer. If the search returns  
something like "Kuala Lumpur is the capital of Malaysia.", I can take that as the answer.                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I need to make sure the code is correct. Let me structure it step by step: call web_search with the query, then process the result to find the capital. Then, use final_answer to
present the answer.                                                                                                                                                              
</think>
