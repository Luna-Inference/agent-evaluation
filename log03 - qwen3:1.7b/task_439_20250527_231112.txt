Okay, the user is asking about the main ingredient in smørrebrød. I need to figure out how to find this information. Smørrebrød is a Danish dish, so  
maybe I can use web search to look up the ingredients.                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I should perform a web search for "smørrebrød ingredients" to find the list of ingredients. Then, I need to extract the main one. The tools    
available include web_search and visit_webpage. Let me use web_search with the query "smørrebrød ingredients".                                        
                                                                                                                                                      
Once I get the results, I'll check the top results to find the main ingredient. The answer should be the first ingredient mentioned in the search     
results. I'll make sure to use the correct tool parameters and not get stuck in a loop. If the search returns multiple results, I'll pick the one that
lists the ingredients clearly. Then, I'll use the final_answer tool to present the answer.                                                            
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the `web_search` tool to find the ingredients of smørrebrød and then extract the main ingredient from the results.

<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, so the user asked about the main ingredient in smørrebrød. From the web search results, I need to figure out which ingredient is most common.   
The search results mention rye bread as the base, but the main toppings vary. The first result says "smørrebrød starts with rye bread, buttered and   
topped with a variety of delicious ingredients." Another result mentions "smørrebrød... starts with rye bread, a piece of buttered rye bread (rugbrød,
a dense, dark brown bread), topped with a variety of delicious ingredients."                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                      
The key here is that the main ingredient is the base, which is rye bread. Even though there are many toppings, the base ingredient is rye bread. The  
other results mention different toppings like shrimp, fish, meat, etc., but the primary component is the bread. So the answer should be rye bread. I  
need to make sure there's no other main ingredient mentioned, but the search results don't highlight any other primary ingredient. Therefore, the main
ingredient is rye bread.                                                                                                                              
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: The main ingredient in smørrebrød is the base rye bread. The search results consistently mention rye bread as the foundational component,    
even with various toppings.
