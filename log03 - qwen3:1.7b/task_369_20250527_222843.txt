<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Georgia. I need to figure out how to get that information. Let me think about the tools available.        
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I remember that in the previous examples, the assistant used web_search and visit_webpage tools to find information. So maybe I should use     
web_search here. The query would be "capital of Georgia". Let me check if there's a specific tool for this.                                           
                                                                                                                                                      
The tools provided include web_search, which returns the top results. So I'll perform a web search for the capital of Georgia. Then, I can extract the
answer from the search results.                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the user wants the answer in the final_answer. So after getting the search results, I need to parse them to find the capital. But how? The      
web_search function returns a string, so I'll need to process that string to find the capital.                                                        
                                                                                                                                                      
Alternatively, maybe the web_search returns a list of results, and I can check the first result for the capital. For example, if the first result is a
webpage stating "The capital of Georgia is Tbilisi.", then I can take that.                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                      
So the steps are: call web_search with "capital of Georgia", then check the results to find the capital. Then use final_answer to present the answer.
