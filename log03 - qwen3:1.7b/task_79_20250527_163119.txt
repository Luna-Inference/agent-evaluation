Okay, the user is asking who invented the light bulb. I need to find the answer using the available tools. Let me think about the steps.              
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I should use the web search tool to look up the invention of the light bulb. The query should be "who invented the light bulb". Then, I can    
retrieve the results and extract the information. Since the tools allow for web searches, I'll perform a search to get the relevant information. Once 
I have the result, I can present the answer directly using the final_answer tool.                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                      
I need to make sure that the search is accurate. The invention of the light bulb is commonly attributed to Thomas Edison, but maybe there are other   
contributors. However, the main answer is Edison. So the code will perform a search, and the result will confirm that. Then, the final answer will    
state that Thomas Edison invented the light bulb.
