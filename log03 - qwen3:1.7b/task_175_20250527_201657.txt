<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the main ingredient in moussaka. I need to figure out what that is. Moussaka is a Greek dish, right? From what I remember, it's a layered pastry    
made with a meat sauce. The main ingredients are usually eggplant, tomatoes, onions, and a meat sauce. But maybe I should verify this.                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the tools available are web_search and visit_webpage. So I should use web_search to look up the main ingredients of moussaka. Let me check the web search results. The     
search query should be "main ingredients in moussaka".                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll run the web search, then parse the results to find the answer. Once I get the ingredients, I can present them as the final answer.

Okay, so the user asked for the main ingredient in moussaka. From the web search results, I need to pick out the key ingredients. The search results mention eggplant, potatoes, 
ground beef, onions, garlic, and a béchamel sauce. The main ingredients are the eggplant and the meat sauce, which includes ground beef. The answer should list the primary      
components. Let me check the results again to confirm. The most detailed recipe says eggplant and potatoes are the main vegetables, and the meat sauce is made with ground beef. 
So the main ingredients are eggplant and the meat sauce. But since the question asks for the main ingredient, maybe it's the eggplant, but the meat sauce is also significant.   
However, the answer should be concise. The user might expect the primary vegetable, but the recipe mentions both. I'll go with the primary vegetables first.

answer should highlight the main components.
