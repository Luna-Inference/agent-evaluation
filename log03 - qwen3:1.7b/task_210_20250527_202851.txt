Okay, the user is asking for the capital of San Marino. Let me think about how to approach this.                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I know that San Marino is a small country in Europe, and its capital is São Marino. But I should verify this to be sure. Since the question is straightforward, maybe I   
can use a web search to confirm the capital.                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the tools available include a web search function. So I should use that. The query would be "capital of San Marino". Let me check the tools again. The web_search function 
takes a query string. So I'll call web_search with the query "capital of San Marino".                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Once I get the results, I can extract the capital from the top result. The observation will show the search results, and then I can parse them to find the answer. Finally, I'll 
use the final_answer tool to present the result.                                                                                                                                 
</think>
