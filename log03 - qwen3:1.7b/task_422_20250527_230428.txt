Okay, the user is asking who discovered the law of conservation of energy in nuclear physics. Let me think about how to approach this.                
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I need to recall if there's a specific person associated with the law of conservation of energy in the context of nuclear physics. The law of  
conservation of energy is a fundamental principle in physics, but in nuclear physics, there's something called the law of conservation of energy in   
nuclear reactions. However, the question is about who discovered this specific law.                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                      
I remember that the law of conservation of energy was generally discovered by Isaac Newton. But wait, in the context of nuclear physics, maybe there's
a specific figure. For example, Einstein's theory of relativity introduced the equivalence of mass and energy, but that's the famous E=mc². However,  
the law of conservation of energy in nuclear reactions might be related to Einstein's work, but I need to confirm.                                    
                                                                                                                                                      
Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the conservation of energy in nuclear reactions, which is a subset of the broader conservation laws.
The law of conservation of energy in nuclear physics is a consequence of the conservation of energy in general, but in nuclear reactions, it's often  
discussed in the context of mass-energy equivalence. However, the actual discovery of the law of conservation of energy itself is attributed to       
Newton.                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                      
But wait, the user might be looking for a specific person in nuclear physics. Maybe it's Einstein? Or someone else? I need to check.                  
                                                                                                                                                      
Since I can't perform web searches here, I have to rely on my existing knowledge. The law of conservation of energy is a fundamental principle in     
physics, and it was first formulated by Isaac Newton. However, in the context of nuclear physics, the conservation of energy is part of the broader   
conservation laws, and the key figure is Newton. But maybe there's a specific contribution from another scientist.                                    
                                                                                                                                                      
Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the conservation of energy in nuclear reactions, which is a result of Einstein's theory, but the law
itself was discovered by Newton. So the answer would be Isaac Newton.                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
But I need to make sure. Since the user is asking about the law of conservation of energy in nuclear physics, and the law itself was discovered by    
Newton, even though it's applied in nuclear physics contexts. So the answer is Isaac Newton.
