<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Singapore. I need to figure out how to get that information. Let me think about the tools I have available.                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I remember that there's a tool called `web_search` which can be used to look up information. The user might need a simple web search to find the capital. Singapore's     
capital is Singapore itself, but maybe I should verify this through a search to be sure.                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the tools allow me to perform a web search with a query. So I can use the `web_search` function with the query "capital of Singapore" to get the top results. Then, I can  
extract the answer from the search results.                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Alternatively, maybe there's a direct answer from a known source. But since the user is asking for the capital, which is a straightforward question, a web search should suffice.
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I should structure the code to perform the web search, then process the results to find the capital. Let me write the code for that.                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, call the web_search function with the query. Then, check the results to confirm the answer. If the search returns that Singapore's capital is Singapore, then that's the  
answer. But since the user is asking for the capital, and Singapore is a country, the answer is obviously Singapore. However, maybe the search will return that information.     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So the code would be something like:                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
web_search("capital of Singapore")                                                                                                                                               
then parse the results to find the capital. But since the tools might return the answer directly, perhaps the code can just print the result.                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, in the previous examples, when the user asked about the population of cities, the code used the `search` function and then printed the result. So here, using `web_search` 
with the query should return the answer.                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Therefore, the code would be:                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
result = web_search("capital of Singapore")                                                                                                                                      
final_answer(result)                                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
But I need to make sure that the web_search returns the correct answer. Since the user is asking for the capital, which is Singapore, the answer is straightforward. However, to 
be thorough, using the web search tool is the correct approach.                                                                                                                  
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the `web_search` tool to find the capital of Singapore.
