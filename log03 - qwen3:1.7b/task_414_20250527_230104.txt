<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of the Czech Republic. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have.                 
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I can use the web search tool to look up the capital. The previous examples show that using web_search with a query like "current pope age"    
works. So maybe I should use web_search with the query "capital of Czech Republic".                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the tools available are web_search and visit_webpage. The web_search function returns the top results. So I'll call web_search with the query   
"capital of Czech Republic". Then, I can parse the result to find the capital.                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                      
But how to handle the response? The observation would be the top results. Let me check the example. In the previous task, when they did a web search, 
the output was a string with the information. So I can extract the capital from that.                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
Alternatively, maybe the web_search returns a list of results, and I need to pick the first one. For example, if the first result is "The capital of  
the Czech Republic is Prague." Then I can extract that.                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                      
So the steps would be: call web_search with the query, then check the results to find the capital. Then use the final_answer to return it.            
                                                                                                                                                      
I should write code that does that. Let me structure it.                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
First, perform the web search. Then, in the observation, parse the result. Then, in the thought, decide to use the final answer based on the parsed   
result.                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                      
But how to handle the parsing? Since the web_search returns a string, maybe the first part is the capital. For example, if the search result starts   
with "The capital of the Czech Republic is Prague.", then the answer is Prague.                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                      
So the code would be:                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
web_search("capital of Czech Republic")                                                                                                               
Then, in the observation, the result is the string. Then, extract the capital from that string.                                                       
                                                                                                                                                      
But the user's question is straightforward. Maybe the web_search returns the answer directly. So the code would be:                                   
                                                                                                                                                      
result = web_search("capital of Czech Republic")                                                                                                      
capital = result.split("is")[1].split(" ")[0]                                                                                                         
final_answer(capital)                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
But I need to make sure that the split is correct. Alternatively, maybe the result is something like "The capital of the Czech Republic is Prague." So
the code would take the part after "is" and before a space, which would be "Prague".                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                      
Alternatively, maybe the result is a list, but in the previous examples, the web_search returns a string. So I'll assume that the first part is the   
answer.                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                      
So the code would be:                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
Code:                                                                                                                                                 
```py                                                                                                                                                 
result = web_search("capital of Czech Republic")                                                                                                      
final_answer(result)                                                                                                                                  
```                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                      
But maybe the result is a string like "The capital of the Czech Republic is Prague." So the answer is "Prague".                                       
                                                                                                                                                      
But the user might expect a more precise answer. However, without knowing the exact output, I have to rely on the tool's response. So the code would  
proceed as above.                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                      
I need to make sure that the code is correct. Let's write the code and see.                                                                           
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the web search tool to find the capital of the Czech Republic and then return the result.
