Okay, the user is asking who is known as the father of computers. I need to figure out the answer. Let me think.                                      
                                                                                                                                                      
From what I remember, the father of computers is usually referred to as Charles Babbage. He was an English mathematician and mechanical engineer. But 
I should verify this. Maybe there's some confusion with other figures. For example, Alan Turing is often mentioned in the context of computer science,
but he's not traditionally called the father of computers.                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                      
I should check if there's any other notable figures. Wait, Babbage proposed the concept of a mechanical computer called the Analytical Engine in the  
1830s. Even though it wasn't built, his work laid the foundation for modern computers. So, he's often cited as the father.                            
                                                                                                                                                      
But maybe the question is looking for a different answer. Let me make sure. The user might expect someone else, but historically, Babbage is the key  
figure here. So the answer should be Charles Babbage.                                                                                                 
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the tool `wiki` to confirm the historical figure known as the father of computers.

Okay, the user is asking who is known as the father of computers. I need to find the correct answer. From my knowledge, Charles Babbage is often      
credited as the father of computers because he designed the Analytical Engine in the 1830s, which was a mechanical general-purpose computer. However, 
the previous attempt tried using a function called wiki, which wasn't allowed. So I need to avoid using external tools and rely on my existing        
knowledge.                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                      
I should check if there's any other way to confirm this. Maybe through a web search, but the previous attempt failed due to forbidden functions. Since
I can't use external tools, I'll have to rely on my knowledge. The answer should be Charles Babbage. Let me make sure there's no confusion with other 
figures like Alan Turing or Konrad Zuse. Turing is more associated with the theory of computation, while Zuse was involved in early computer design.  
So Babbage is the correct answer here.                                                                                                                
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: Since external tools are restricted, I'll directly answer based on historical knowledge.
