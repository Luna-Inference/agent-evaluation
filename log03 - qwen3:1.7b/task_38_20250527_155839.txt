<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking who painted the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. I need to figure out how to find this information. Let me think about the     
tools I have.                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I remember that there's a tool called 'wiki' which can search for information. Maybe I can use that to look up the Sistine Chapel's ceiling.   
But I also remember that the Sistine Chapel's ceiling is famously painted by Michelangelo. However, to be thorough, I should verify this using a web  
search to ensure accuracy.                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                      
So the plan is: use the wiki tool to get the information, and then check if the answer is correct. If the wiki returns Michelangelo, then that's the  
answer. If not, maybe there's another painter involved. But given the historical context, Michelangelo is the most well-known painter of the Sistine  
Chapel ceiling.                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, but the user might want the exact answer. Let me structure the code to use the wiki tool with the query "who painted the ceiling of the Sistine 
Chapel". Then, if the result is Michelangelo, I can confirm it. If not, maybe there's a different approach, but given the context, it's likely        
Michelangelo.                                                                                                                                         
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the `wiki` tool to search for the answer about who painted the Sistine Chapel's ceiling.                                          
Code:

Okay, the user is asking who painted the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. I tried using the wiki tool earlier, but the system said that 'wiki' isn't    
allowed. Hmm, maybe the tools available are limited. Since the user mentioned that the Sistine Chapel's ceiling is famously painted by Michelangelo,  
maybe I can use that knowledge directly. But the task requires using the tools provided. Since the wiki tool isn't working, I need to find another    
way.                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the tools allowed are the ones listed in the problem statement. The user mentioned that the assistant can use imports from certain modules.     
Maybe I can use the web_search tool to look up the answer. Let me try that. The web_search function can search the web for the answer. So I'll use    
web_search with the query "who painted the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel". Then, based on the result, I can provide the answer.                       
                                                                                                                                                      
I need to make sure the code is correct. The code should call web_search with the right parameters. Let me write the code: use web_search with the    
query, then print the result. Finally, use final_answer to output the answer. That should work.
