<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the main ingredient in ratatouille. I need to figure out how to find this information. Let me think about the tools I have available. The tools     
include web search, visiting web pages, and final answer.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I should use a web search to look up the ingredients of ratatouille. The query should be straightforward. Maybe something like "main ingredient ratatouille". I'll use the
web_search tool with that query. Then, I can check the results to find the answer.                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the user might expect a specific answer. Let me make sure I get the correct information. If the web search returns a list of ingredients, I need to extract the main one.  
But according to the tools provided, I can just return the answer directly once I have the result. So, I'll perform the search, get the result, and then use the final_answer    
tool to present the answer.                                                                                                                                                      
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the main ingredient of ratatouille.
