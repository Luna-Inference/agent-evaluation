<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the tallest animal in the world. I need to figure out how to find that. Let me think about the tools available. The previous examples used web      
searches and wiki lookups. Maybe I can use a web search here.                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I should check the current knowledge. I remember that the tallest animal is the giraffe. But maybe there's a more accurate way to confirm. The tools here include a web   
search function. So I'll use that to look up the latest information.                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll use the web_search tool with the query "tallest animal in the world". Then, I can retrieve the results and extract the answer. Since the user wants the final answer, I'll  
make sure to present it correctly. Let me write the code to do that.                                                                                                             
</think>
