Okay, the user is asking about the Greek goddess of wisdom. Let me think. From what I remember, wisdom is often associated with Athena in Greek mythology. Athena is the goddess 
of strategic warfare, wisdom, and knowledge. She's one of the major deities in ancient Greece. But I should verify this to be sure.                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I need to check if there's any other goddess associated with wisdom. Sometimes there are multiple deities, but Athena is the primary one. Maybe I can use a search tool to       
confirm. The tools available include web search, so I'll use that. Let me perform a web search for "Greek goddess of wisdom" to find the answer.                                 
</think>
