<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking who the founder of Microsoft is. I need to figure out how to find this information. Let me think about the tools I have.     
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I remember that the user provided some tools like web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer. So maybe I can use web_search to look up the    
founder of Microsoft. The question is straightforward, so I'll start by performing a web search for "founder of Microsoft".                           
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the tools are notional, but I can use them as if they exist. So I'll call web_search with the query "founder of Microsoft". The observation will
give me the results. Then, I can parse the results to find the answer. If the search returns the correct information, I can extract the founder's name
and use final_answer to present it.                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                      
Alternatively, if the search returns something like "Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen", then the answer is Bill Gates. But I need to
make sure the search result is accurate. Since the user is asking for the founder, and Microsoft was founded in 1975 by Bill Gates and Paul Allen, the
answer should be Bill Gates.                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                      
I should check the web_search result first. Let me write the code to perform the search and then extract the answer.                                  
</think>
