Okay, the user is asking for the largest island in the world. I need to figure out how to find that. Let me think about the tools I have.                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I remember that there are tools like web_search and visit_webpage. Maybe I can use web_search to look up the largest island. But how to structure the code?               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the user provided some examples where they used web_search with specific queries. So maybe I should perform a web search for "largest island in the world" and get the top 
results. Then, extract the information from those results.                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
But how to handle the output? The previous examples show that when using web_search, the output is a string. So I can parse that string to find the answer.                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Alternatively, maybe there's a specific tool for this. But since the available tools are web_search and visit_webpage, I'll proceed with web_search.                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So the plan is: use web_search with the query "largest island in the world", then parse the result to find the answer. Then, use final_answer to present the answer.             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I need to make sure the code is correct. Let me write the code step by step.                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, call web_search with the query. Then, check the results. The answer should be something like "Borneo" or "Greenland" depending on the source. But I need to extract that  
from the search results.                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the previous examples show that when using web_search, the output is a string. So I can print the result and then process it. For instance, if the search result says "The 
largest island is Borneo," then the answer is Borneo.                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So the code would be:                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
web_search("largest island in the world")                                                                                                                                        
print("Largest island: " + result)                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Then, final_answer would take the extracted information.                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
But how to handle the extraction? Since the output is a string, maybe the answer is in the first few lines. For example, if the result is "The largest island is Borneo," then   
the code can take that.                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Alternatively, maybe the search result includes a list of islands, and the largest one is the first one. So the code can split the string and take the first element.            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
But since the exact format is unknown, perhaps the best approach is to use the first occurrence of the answer in the search result.                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So the code would be:                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
result = web_search("largest island in the world")                                                                                                                               
print("Largest island: " + result)                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Then, final_answer would take the first part of the result.                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
But I need to make sure that the code is correct. Let me write the code as:                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Code:                                                                                                                                                                            
```py                                                                                                                                                                            
result = web_search("largest island in the world")                                                                                                                               
final_answer(result)                                                                                                                                                             
```                                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
But maybe the search result is not directly giving the answer. For example, if the search result is a list of islands, then the code would need to parse that. However, without  
knowing the exact structure, it's safer to assume that the first part of the result is the answer.                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Alternatively, maybe the answer is in the first line. So the code can take the first line and split it.                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
But since the user's previous examples show that the output is a string, and the answer is in the first part, I'll proceed with the code as above.                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Another possibility is that the largest island is Greenland, but I need to confirm. However, the web_search tool will handle that.                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So the final answer would be the result of the web_search.                                                                                                                       
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the largest island in the world and then return the result.
