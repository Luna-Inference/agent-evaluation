<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the chemical symbol of uranium. I need to figure out what that is. From what I remember, uranium is a heavy metal, and its symbol is U. But maybe I 
should verify this.                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the tools available include web search and wiki. So perhaps I should use the web_search tool to check the exact answer. Let me think. The user might want the most accurate
answer, so searching the web would be better than relying on memory.                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So the steps would be: use the web_search tool with the query "chemical symbol for uranium" to get the correct answer. Then, extract the symbol from the search results and      
return it.                                                                                                                                                                       
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the chemical symbol for uranium.
