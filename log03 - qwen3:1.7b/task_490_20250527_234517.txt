<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking about the largest coral reef system. I need to figure out how to find this information. Let's think.                         
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I remember that coral reefs are usually found in warm ocean areas, like the Caribbean, Indo-Pacific, and Atlantic. The largest ones are often  
the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, the Coral Triangle, and the Coral Sea. But I need to confirm which is the largest.                               
                                                                                                                                                      
I should use a web search to find the latest information. The tools available include web_search. So I'll perform a web search with the query "largest
coral reef system". Then, I can check the results to determine which one is the largest.                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Wait, the user might want the most recent data. Maybe the Great Barrier Reef is still the largest, but I should verify. Let me code a web search and  
then process the results.                                                                                                                             
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the largest coral reef system and then return the final answer based on the search results.
