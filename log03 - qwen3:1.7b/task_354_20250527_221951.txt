Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Kyrgyzstan. Let me think about how to approach this.                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I know that the capital of a country is usually the city that serves as the political center. Kyrgyzstan is a country in Central Asia. From my previous knowledge, I      
recall that the capital of Kyrgyzstan is Bishkek. But I should verify this to make sure there's no recent change or confusion.                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Since the user might expect an accurate answer, I should use a reliable method to confirm. The available tools include web search and wiki. Using the web_search function would  
be appropriate here. I can perform a search for "capital of Kyrgyzstan" to get the latest information.                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the tools mentioned are web_search and visit_webpage. So I can call web_search with the query "capital of Kyrgyzstan". The result should provide the capital city. Once I  
get the result, I can extract the capital from the search results and then use the final_answer tool to present the answer.                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I need to make sure that the search is accurate. If the search returns the correct information, I can confidently state that the capital is Bishkek. If there's any uncertainty, 
I should check another source, but given the tools available, web_search should suffice here.                                                                                    
</think>                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the capital of Kyrgyzstan.
