Okay, let's see. The user is asking for 15 multiplied by 7. Hmm, that's a straightforward math problem. I need to check if there's any tool required  
here. The previous examples show that when the task is a simple calculation, the assistant uses Python code to compute it.                            
                                                                                                                                                      
Looking at the tools available, there's a 'final_answer' function that takes an any type answer. So the assistant can just compute 15 * 7 directly.   
Let me make sure there's no need for additional steps. Since it's a simple multiplication, no web search or other tools are necessary. The answer is  
105. So the code would be as simple as print(15 * 7) and then final_answer. But according to the rules, the code must end with

Okay, the user is asking for 15 multiplied by 7. Let me think about how to approach this. Since it's a simple arithmetic problem, I don't need any    
external tools. The assistant can just compute the result directly.                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                      
The previous attempt had an error because the code wasn't properly formatted. Let me make sure the code is correctly structured. The code should use  
the final_answer function with the result of 15 * 7. I need to ensure that the code is valid and follows the rules provided.                          
                                                                                                                                                      
So the correct code would be:                                                                                                                         
```py                                                                                                                                                 
final_answer(15 * 7)                                                                                                                                  
```                                                                                                                                                   
This should output 105. I need to check that the code isn't using any invalid syntax or structures. Also, make sure that the final_answer is called   
with the correct argument. Let me verify that the code ends with
