<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Norway. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools available. The tools include web search, visiting webpages, and
final answer. So maybe I should use the web search function to look up the capital of Norway.                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I'll use the web_search tool with the query "capital of Norway". Then, I can retrieve the results and extract the capital from the top result. Once I have the answer, I  
can use the final_answer tool to present it.                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the user's question is straightforward. The capital of Norway is Oslo. But to be thorough, I should confirm using the web search tool to ensure accuracy. Let me check the 
search results.
