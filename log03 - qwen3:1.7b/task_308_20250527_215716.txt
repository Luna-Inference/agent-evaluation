<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking who discovered the law of conservation of angular momentum. I need to figure out how to find this information. Let me think about the tools I have.     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I can use the web search tool to look up the answer. The question is straightforward, so a simple search should work. I'll use the web_search function with the query "who
discovered the law of conservation of angular momentum".                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Wait, the tools mentioned include web_search and visit_webpage. So I'll call web_search with the appropriate query. The answer should be retrieved from the search results. Once 
I get the result, I can present it as the final answer.                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I should make sure not to use any other tools unless necessary. Since the question is about a historical figure, the web search should return the correct information. Let me    
execute the code.                                                                                                                                                                
</think>

The same is true of energy and of angular momentum. These concepts provide shortcuts to the integration. The real importance of energy, momentum and angular momentum is only 
made evident when one considers moving the physical apparatus by translation, rotation or by performing the same experiment at different times.

[Angular momentum - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum)
Angular momentum (sometimes called moment of momentum or rotational momentum) is the rotational analog of linear momentum.It is an important physical quantity because it is a 
conserved quantity - the total angular momentum of a closed system remains constant. Angular momentum has both a direction and a magnitude, and both are conserved. Bicycles and

In this case, we can introduce the law of conservation of angular momentum. Law of Conservation of Angular Momentum. The angular momentum of a system of particles around a point
in a fixed inertial reference frame is conserved if there is no net external torque around that point: \[\frac{d \vec{L}}{dt} = 0 \label{11.10}\] or

We will apply it to two other conservation laws which have exact correspondence in the physical ideas to the conservation of angular momentum. In classical physics we also have 
conservation of momentum and conservation of energy, and it is interesting to see that both of these are related in the same way to some physical symmetry.
