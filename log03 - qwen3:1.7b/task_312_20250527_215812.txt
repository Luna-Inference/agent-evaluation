<think>                                                                                                                                                                          
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Vanuatu. Let me think about how to approach this.                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
First, I know that Vanuatu is an island country in the Pacific Ocean. From my knowledge, the capital is Port Vai. But I should verify this to be sure. Since the question is     
straightforward, maybe a web search would help confirm the answer. However, the tools available include web_search and visit_webpage. Let me use the web_search function with the
query "capital of Vanuatu" to get the most accurate result.                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
I'll write a code snippet that performs a web search for the capital of Vanuatu. Then, I'll extract the information from the search results and present it as the final answer.
