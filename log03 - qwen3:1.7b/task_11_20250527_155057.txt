Okay, the user is asking for the boiling point of water in Celsius. I remember from basic science that at standard atmospheric pressure, water boils  
at 100 degrees Celsius. But I should verify this using the tools provided.                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I need to check if there's a tool that can give this information. The available tools are web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer. Since   
the user is asking for a factual answer, web_search might be the best option. I can perform a web search for "boiling point of water in Celsius" to   
get the accurate information.                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                      
I'll use the web_search function with the query "boiling point of water in Celsius". Then, I'll extract the result and present it as the final answer.
Since the answer is straightforward, I don't need to do any additional steps like visiting a specific webpage. The search should return the standard  
answer, and I can just print it.
