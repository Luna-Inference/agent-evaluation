<think>                                                                                                                                               
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Finland. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have available. There's the wiki 
tool, which can be used to look up information. Also, there's the web_search tool, which can perform a search.                                        
                                                                                                                                                      
First, I should check if the wiki tool can provide the capital. The wiki tool's query would be "capital of Finland". If that returns the correct      
information, I can use that. If not, I can use web_search. But since the user is expecting a straightforward answer, maybe the wiki tool will suffice.
                                                                                                                                                      
I'll start by using the wiki tool with the query "capital of Finland". If the result is something like "The capital of Finland is Helsinki.", then I  
can extract that and give the answer. If not, I'll need to perform a web search. But given that the user is asking for a known fact, the wiki tool    
should work.                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                      
So the code would be something like:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                      
pope_age_wiki = wiki(query="capital of Finland")                                                                                                      
print("Capital of Finland:", pope_age_wiki)                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                      
Then, if the output is correct, I can final_answer the result. If not, proceed with web_search. But since the user's question is straightforward, I'll
go with the wiki tool first.                                                                                                                          
</think>                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Thought: I will use the `wiki` tool to find the capital of Finland.

Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Finland. Earlier, I tried using the `wiki` tool but got an error because the tool wasn't allowed. Now I   
need to figure out another way to get the answer without using the `wiki` function.                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                      
Since the `wiki` tool is forbidden, I should use a different method. Maybe the web search tool? Let me check the allowed tools again. The user        
mentioned that the allowed modules include `web_search` and `visit_webpage`. So I can use `web_search` to look up the capital.                        
                                                                                                                                                      
I'll perform a web search for "capital of Finland" and then extract the answer from the results. The code would be something like:                    
                                                                                                                                                      
web_search("capital of Finland") → retrieves the top result, which should be "Helsinki".                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
Then, I can print the result and final answer accordingly. Let me write the code now.
