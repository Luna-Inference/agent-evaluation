Okay, the user is asking who wrote "Frankenstein". I need to find the answer using the tools available. Let me think about the      
steps.                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                    
First, I should use a search tool to look up the author of "Frankenstein". The tools provided include web_search and visit_webpage. 
Since the question is straightforward, a web search should suffice. The query would be "who wrote Frankenstein".                    
                                                                                                                                    
I'll call the web_search function with the query. Then, I'll check the results to find the author. The result should mention the    
author, probably a famous name like Mary Shelley. Once I get the answer, I can present it as the final answer.
