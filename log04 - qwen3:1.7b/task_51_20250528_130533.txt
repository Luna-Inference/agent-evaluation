Okay, the user is asking about the Greek god of the sea. From my knowledge, the Greek gods  
often have specific domains. I remember that Poseidon is the god of the sea, underwater, and
storms. But I should verify this.                                                           
                                                                                            
Wait, the tools available include web search. So I should use the web_search function to    
check the exact answer. Let me structure the code to perform a web search for "Greek god of 
the sea" and retrieve the top result. Then, extract the answer from the search results.     
                                                                                            
I need to make sure the query is precise. Maybe using the search function with the exact    
phrase. The tool will return the top results, so I'll parse the first result to find the    
answer. Once I get the answer, I can present it as the final answer.

Okay, so the user asked, "Who is the Greek god of the sea?" Based on the web search results,
I need to determine the answer. The search results mention Poseidon as the god of the sea,  
but I should confirm this.                                                                  
                                                                                            
From the observation, the web search returned multiple sources pointing to Poseidon. The    
first result lists Poseidon as the king of the sea, and other sources like Britannica and   
Wikipedia confirm his role. The answer is clear from the search results. I should present   
this information as the final answer.
