Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Canada. I need to find that information. Let me 
think about the tools available. The user mentioned using web search and visiting webpages, 
so maybe I can use the web_search function.                                                 
                                                                                            
First, I should perform a web search for "capital of Canada". The previous examples show    
that when searching, the results are returned as strings. So I'll use the web_search tool   
with the query "capital of Canada".                                                         
                                                                                            
Once I get the search results, I need to extract the capital from the top result. The       
observation will show the search results, and I can parse them to find the capital. For     
example, if the first result is "The capital of Canada is Ottawa.", then the answer is      
Ottawa.                                                                                     
                                                                                            
I should check the search results carefully to make sure I get the correct information. If  
the search returns multiple results, I'll pick the first one that mentions the capital.     
Then, use the final_answer function to return the capital.

Thought: I will use the web search tool to find the capital of Canada and then extract the  
answer from the search results.
