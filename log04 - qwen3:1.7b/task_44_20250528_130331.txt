Okay, the user wants to know a country that starts with the letter 'Z'. Let me think about  
how to approach this.                                                                       
                                                                                            
First, I need to find a list of countries and check their names. The letter 'Z' comes after 
'Y' in the alphabet, so countries starting with 'Z' are rare. Examples include Zambia,      
Zimbabwe, and maybe some others like Zaire (which is no longer a country, but historically  
existed).                                                                                   
                                                                                            
Since the user is asking for a country, I should probably use a web search to find such a   
country. The tools available include a web search function. So I'll use the web_search tool 
with the query "country starting with Z".                                                   
                                                                                            
I'll check the results to see which country is listed. If the search returns multiple       
results, I can pick one. If not, maybe there's a specific country like Zambia.              
                                                                                            
Once I get the result, I can present it as the answer. Let me code that.                    
</think>                                                                                    
                                                                                            
Thought: I will use the web search tool to find a country starting with 'Z' and then return 
the result.                                                                                 
Code:                                                                                       
```py                                                                                       
country = web_search(query="country starting with Z")                                       
final_answer(country)                                                                       
```
