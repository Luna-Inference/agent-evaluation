Okay, the user is asking for the chemical symbol of mercury. I need to figure out what that is. From what I remember, mercury is a  
metal, and its symbol is Hg. But maybe I should verify this to be sure. Let me check if there's a tool I can use to confirm.        
                                                                                                                                    
Looking at the tools available, there's the wiki function. I can use that to look up the chemical symbols of elements. The wiki tool
would probably return the correct symbol for mercury. Alternatively, maybe the web_search tool can be used to find the answer. But  
since the user might expect a straightforward answer, using the wiki tool seems efficient.                                          
                                                                                                                                    
Wait, the user didn't specify any particular method, so the best approach is to use the wiki function with the query "chemical      
symbol for mercury". That should give the correct answer. Let me write the code to call the wiki function with that query.          
</think>

Okay, the user is asking for the chemical symbol of mercury. I remember that mercury is a metal and its symbol is Hg. But I need to 
confirm this properly. The previous attempt tried using the wiki tool, but there was an error because the tool wasn't allowed. Let  
me think of another way.                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                    
Since the user's question is straightforward, maybe I can use the built-in knowledge base. I know that mercury's symbol is indeed   
Hg. But the system requires using the provided tools. Since the wiki tool wasn't available, perhaps I can use the web_search tool to
look up the answer. Let me try that.                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                    
I'll use the web_search function with the query "chemical symbol for mercury". This should return the correct symbol. Then I can    
print the result and give the final answer.
