Okay, the user is asking who discovered the vaccine for polio. I need to figure out the answer. Let me think.                       
                                                                                                                                    
First, I remember that polio is a viral disease, and the vaccine was developed by Edward Jenner in 1798. He was a British physician 
who observed that milk from a cow that had been exposed to a virus (which he thought was from a cow's milk) protected against the   
disease. He named the virus after the cow, but the actual virus is called after the person who discovered it, which is Jenner.      
                                                                                                                                    
But wait, I should verify this. Maybe there's more to it. The question is about the vaccine, so the answer is Edward Jenner.        
However, I need to make sure there's no later discovery. I recall that the Salk vaccine was developed in the 1950s, but that's a    
different type of vaccine. The question is about the vaccine, not the specific type. So the answer is Jenner.                       
                                                                                                                                    
But maybe the user wants the exact name, like Edward Jenner. I should check if there's any other figure involved. No, Jenner is the 
key person here. So the answer is Edward Jenner.                                                                                    
</think>                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                    
Thought: I will use the tool `wiki` to find the answer about the discoverer of the polio vaccine.

Okay, the user is asking who discovered the polio vaccine. I remember that Edward Jenner is the correct answer, but the previous    
attempt tried using a forbidden tool 'wiki'. Since that's not allowed, I need to find another way to get the information.           
                                                                                                                                    
Maybe I can use a web search directly. The tool 'web_search' can be used to look up the answer. Let me try that. I'll perform a web 
search for "who discovered the polio vaccine" and then extract the answer from the results.                                         
                                                                                                                                    
I should check the web search results to confirm the answer. If the search returns the correct information, I can finalize the      
answer. If not, maybe I need to try another approach, but given the constraints, this is the best way.

Jonas Salk (October 28, 1914 - October 28, 1995) was an American medical researcher and physician. While serving as the head of the 
Virus Research Lab at the University of Pittsburgh, Salk discovered and perfected the first vaccine found to be safe and effective 
in preventing polio or infantile paralysis, one of the most-feared and crippling diseases of the early 20th century.

timeline](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/history-disease-outbreaks-vaccine-timeline/polio)
The polio vaccine developed by Dr. Salk and colleagues is licensed in the U.S. Before the polio vaccine, the disease had been a 
major cause of disability in children. About 16,000 cases of polio (paralytic poliomyelitis) occurred each year in the U.S. in the 
20th century compared with none in 2023.

Dr. Jonas Salk is credited with developing the first polio vaccine, which was approved for use in 1955. While AJHS does not possess 
the papers of the noted virologist, that honor goes to the University of California San Diego, we do house in our collections two 
letters that shed light on Dr. Salk's work and determination at a critical point in his career.

Salk's vaccine. The final answer should be Jonas Salk. Let me confirm the most prominent figure here. The results clearly state that
Salk developed the first safe and effective vaccine. Even though Sabin made another type, the question is about the vaccine
