<think>                                                                                                                             
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Hungary. Let me think about how to approach this.                                       
                                                                                                                                    
First, I know that the capital of Hungary is Budapest. But maybe I should verify this using a reliable source. Since the tools      
available include web search and wiki, I can use those. Let me check the wiki tool first.                                           
                                                                                                                                    
I'll use the wiki function with the query "capital of Hungary" to get the information. If the wiki returns the correct answer, I can
use that. If not, maybe a web search would help. But given that Budapest is a well-known capital, the wiki should have the correct  
answer. Let me proceed with the wiki tool.                                                                                          
</think>                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                    
Thought: I will use the `wiki` tool to find the capital of Hungary.

```py

Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Hungary. I tried using the wiki tool earlier, but there was an error because the tool   
wasn't allowed. Let me think of another way to get the answer.                                                                      
                                                                                                                                    
Since I can't use the wiki tool, maybe I can use a web search. The web_search function is allowed. I'll search for "capital of      
Hungary" using the web_search tool. Then, I can extract the answer from the search results.                                         
                                                                                                                                    
I need to make sure the search is accurate. The capital of Hungary is Budapest, but I should confirm via the search. Let me perform 
the search and then retrieve the answer.

Okay, so the user asked for the capital of Hungary. I first tried using the wiki tool, but it wasn't allowed. Then I tried the web  
search tool. The web search results showed that Budapest is the capital. The observation from the code showed multiple sources      
confirming that Budapest is the capital of Hungary. Therefore, the answer is straightforward.

consistently mention Budapest as the capital. So the final answer is Budapest.
