<think>                                                                                                                             
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Latvia. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools available. The    
tools include web search, visiting web pages, and final answer. Since the answer is straightforward, maybe a web search would work. 
                                                                                                                                    
First, I should perform a web search for "capital of Latvia". The search tool can handle that. Then, I can extract the capital from 
the results. But wait, the user might expect a direct answer. Let me check the tools again. The web_search function returns the top 
results, so I need to parse those results to find the capital.                                                                      
                                                                                                                                    
Alternatively, maybe the wiki tool can be used. But the wiki tool's parameters are not clear. The user's previous examples used     
web_search and visited_webpage. So perhaps using web_search with the query "capital of Latvia" would give the necessary information.
                                                                                                                                    
Once I get the search results, I can look for the capital name. For example, the results might mention that the capital is Riga.    
Then, I can use the final_answer function to return that.                                                                           
                                                                                                                                    
Wait, the user's previous examples show that after performing the search, the code prints the results and then uses final_answer. So
I need to structure the code to perform the search, process the results, and then output the answer.                                
                                                                                                                                    
Let me write the code. First, perform the web search with the query "capital of Latvia". Then, extract the capital from the first   
result. Then, use final_answer with that capital.                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                    
But how to extract the capital from the search results? The web_search function returns a string, which I can split or parse. For   
example, if the result is "The capital of Latvia is Riga.", then the capital is "Riga".                                             
                                                                                                                                    
So the code would be:                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                    
Perform web search, get the result, split the string to find the capital, then final_answer.                                        
                                                                                                                                    
But the exact implementation details of the web_search function are not clear. The user's previous example shows that the web_search
returns the top results as a string. So I can assume that the first result contains the capital.                                    
                                                                                                                                    
Therefore, the code would be:                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                    
Code:                                                                                                                               
```py                                                                                                                               
capital = web_search(query="capital of Latvia")                                                                                     
final_answer(capital)                                                                                                               
```                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                    
But I need to make sure that the web_search returns the correct information. If the search result is something like "The capital of 
Latvia is Riga.", then the code would correctly return "Riga".                                                                      
                                                                                                                                    
Alternatively, if the search result is a list of URLs, I need to parse them. But the previous examples show that the web_search     
returns the top results as a string. So perhaps the first part of the string is the answer.                                         
                                                                                                                                    
Therefore, the code should work as written.                                                                                         
</think>                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                    
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the capital of Latvia and then return the result.                                   
Code:
