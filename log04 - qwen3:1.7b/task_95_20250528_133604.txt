<think>                                                                                                                             
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Argentina. I need to figure out how to get that information. Let me think about the     
tools I have available.                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                    
First, I remember that in the previous examples, when dealing with questions like "What is the population of Guangzhou?" the        
assistant used the web_search tool. So maybe I can use web_search here as well. The query would be "capital of Argentina".          
                                                                                                                                    
Wait, the tools mentioned are web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer. So the plan is to perform a web search for the capital of
Argentina, get the top result, and then extract the answer.                                                                         
                                                                                                                                    
But how to structure the code? The user's previous examples used the web_search function with a query string. So I should call      
web_search with the query "capital of Argentina". Then, the result would be the top search result.                                  
                                                                                                                                    
Once I have that result, I can parse it to find the capital. For instance, if the search result says "The capital of Argentina is   
Buenos Aires.", then the answer is Buenos Aires.                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                    
But since the tools don't have a function to parse the result, I have to assume that the web_search returns the exact answer. So I  
can just final_answer the result directly.                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                    
Wait, the previous example for the pope's age used the wiki tool and then computed the answer. Here, maybe the web_search will      
return the direct answer. So I can just call web_search with the query and then final_answer the result.                            
                                                                                                                                    
So the code would be:                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                    
web_search("capital of Argentina")                                                                                                  
final_answer(result)                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                    
But I need to make sure that the web_search returns the correct answer. If the search result is "The capital of Argentina is Buenos 
Aires.", then the answer is Buenos Aires. But since the tool's output is not specified, I have to rely on the tool's return value.  
                                                                                                                                    
Therefore, the code should be:                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                    
Code:                                                                                                                               
```py                                                                                                                               
result = web_search(query="capital of Argentina")                                                                                   
final_answer(result)
