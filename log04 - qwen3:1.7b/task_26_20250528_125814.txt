<think>                                                                                     
Okay, the user wants me to define 'photosynthesis'. I need to figure out how to approach    
this. Since I'm supposed to use the tools provided, let me check the available functions.   
                                                                                            
The tools are web_search and visit_webpage. So maybe I should use web_search to look up the 
definition of photosynthesis. Let me try that.                                              
                                                                                            
First, I'll call web_search with the query "definition of photosynthesis". Then, I'll parse 
the results to find the relevant information. The results might be in the form of a string, 
so I'll extract the part that mentions photosynthesis.                                      
                                                                                            
Wait, the user might expect a concise definition. Let me make sure the answer is accurate.  
If the web_search returns the correct definition, I can present it. If not, maybe I need to 
adjust the query, but since the tools are limited, I'll proceed with the first search.      
</think>                                                                                    
                                                                                            
Thought: I will use the `web_search` tool to find the definition of photosynthesis and then 
extract the relevant information.                                                           
Code:                                                                                       
```py                                                                                       
photosynthesis_definition = web_search(query="definition of photosynthesis")

...](https://www.britannica.com/science/photosynthesis)
Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and certain other organisms transform 
light energy into chemical energy. During photosynthesis in green plants, light energy is 
captured and used to convert water, carbon dioxide, and minerals into oxygen and energy-rich
organic compounds.
