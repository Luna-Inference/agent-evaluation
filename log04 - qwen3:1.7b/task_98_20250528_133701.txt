Okay, the user is asking who discovered America. Let me think about how to approach this.                                           
                                                                                                                                    
First, I need to find the historical answer. The question is straightforward, but I should verify the correct information. Since the
tools available include web search and wiki, I can use those to get the answer.                                                     
                                                                                                                                    
I'll start by using the web_search tool with the query "who discovered America". That should retrieve the top results. Then, I can  
check the first result to get the answer. If the search returns the correct information, I can extract the name and present it as   
the final answer.                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                    
Wait, the user might expect the answer to be Christopher Columbus, but I should make sure. Let me perform the search and then       
process the result.                                                                                                                 
</think>                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                    
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the answer to the question "who discovered America" and then extract the relevant   
information.                                                                                                                        
Code:

discovery = web_search(query="who discovered America")                                                                              
print("Discovery of America: ", discovery)
