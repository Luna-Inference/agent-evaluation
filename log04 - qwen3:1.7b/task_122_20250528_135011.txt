Okay, the user is asking who discovered radioactivity. I need to figure out the answer. I remember that radioactivity was discovered
by Henri Becquerel, but I should verify this.                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                    
First, I should use the web search tool to check the latest information. Let me perform a search for "who discovered radioactivity" 
to confirm. The results might show the correct answer. Once I get the information, I can present it as the final answer.

[Marie Curie - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Curie)
Marie Curie was a physicist and chemist who discovered polonium and radium, and coined the term radioactivity. She won two Nobel 
Prizes, one in physics and one in chemistry, and founded the Curie Institute in Paris and Warsaw.

[Henri Becquerel | French Physicist & Radioactivity Pioneer | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Henri-Becquerel)
Henri Becquerel discovered radioactivity in 1896 by observing the penetrating radiation emitted by uranium salts. He shared the 
Nobel Prize for Physics in 1903 with Pierre and Marie Curie for their studies of radioactivity.

Henri Becquerel was a French physicist who discovered radioactivity in 1896 by accident. He found that uranium emitted radiation 
even without sunlight and won the Nobel Prize in Physics with Marie and Pierre Curie.

[Marie Curie | Biography, Nobel Prize, Accomplishments, & Facts - Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Marie-Curie)
Following Henri Becquerel's discovery (1896) of a new phenomenon (which she later called "radioactivity"), Marie Curie, looking for 
a subject for a thesis, decided to find out if the property discovered in uranium was to be found in other matter. She discovered 
that this was true for thorium at the same time as G.C. Schmidt did.

The first evidence for radioactivity - images formed by Becquerel's uranium salts (Image: Wikimedia Commons) French physicist Henri 
Becquerel discovered radioactivity while working on a series of experiments on phosphorescent materials. On 26 February 1896, he 
placed uranium salts on top of a photographic plate wrapped in black paper.
