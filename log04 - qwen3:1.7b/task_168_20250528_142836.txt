Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Lithuania. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have.        
                                                                                                                                    
Hmm, the available tools are web search, visiting webpages, and final answer. So maybe I can use the web_search function to look up 
the capital of Lithuania. The query would be "capital of Lithuania". Let me check if there's a direct way to get this information.  
                                                                                                                                    
Wait, I remember that the capital of Lithuania is Vilnius. But maybe I should verify using the web search tool to make sure. Let me 
write a code snippet to perform a web search for the capital of Lithuania. Then, once I get the result, I can extract the capital   
from the search results and provide it as the final answer.                                                                         
</think>

multiple sources mentioning Vilnius as the capital. The observations from the code didn't provide a direct answer, but the search   
results clearly state that Vilnius is the capital. Since the web search returned the necessary information, I can confidently       
extract the answer from the results. The final answer should be Vilnius.
