Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Poland. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have available. 
There's the wiki tool, which can be used to look up information. Also, web search tools, but maybe the wiki is more direct.         
                                                                                                                                    
First, I should use the wiki tool with the query "capital of Poland". Let me check if that's possible. The previous examples show   
that the wiki function takes a query string. So I'll call wiki with the query "capital of Poland".                                  
                                                                                                                                    
Once I get the result from the wiki, I can parse it to find the capital. For instance, if the wiki returns something like "The      
capital of Poland is Warsaw.", then I can extract that information. Then, I can use the final_answer tool to present the result.    
                                                                                                                                    
I need to make sure that the wiki tool is correctly called. Let me write the code: pope_age_wiki = wiki(query="capital of Poland"). 
Then, print the result to check. If the result is correct, I can proceed to the final answer.                                       
                                                                                                                                    
Wait, but the user might want the answer directly. So after getting the wiki result, I'll check if the capital is mentioned and then
return it. If there's any uncertainty, maybe a web search could confirm, but given the tools, wiki should be sufficient. Let's      
proceed with the wiki call first.                                                                                                   
</think>                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                    
Thought: I will use the `wiki` tool to find the capital of Poland.

Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Poland. Previously, I tried using the wiki tool but got an error because the function   
wasn't allowed. Now I need to find another way to get the answer without using the wiki tool.                                       
                                                                                                                                    
Since the allowed tools are limited, I have to rely on other methods. Maybe the web search tool can help. Let me check the allowed  
tools again. The user mentioned that the tools include web_search. So I can use that.                                               
                                                                                                                                    
I'll use the web_search function with the query "capital of Poland" to find the answer. Then, I can parse the result to extract the 
capital city. The answer should be straightforward once the search is done.                                                         
                                                                                                                                    
I need to make sure the code is correct. The previous attempt used wiki, which wasn't allowed. Now, using web_search directly. Let  
me write the code: call web_search with the query, then check the result to find the capital. Finally, use final_answer to present  
the answer.
