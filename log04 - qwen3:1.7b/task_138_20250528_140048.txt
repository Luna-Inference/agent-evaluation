Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Finland. Let me think about how to approach this.                                       
                                                                                                                                    
First, I need to find the capital city of Finland. The capital of Finland is Helsinki. But maybe I should verify this using a tool  
to make sure. However, the available tools are web search and wiki. Let me check if the web search can directly give the answer.    
                                                                                                                                    
Wait, the user provided some tools: web_search and wiki. So I can use web_search with the query "capital of Finland" to get the     
result. Alternatively, using the wiki tool with the query "capital of Finland". Let me try the wiki first.                          
                                                                                                                                    
If the wiki returns the correct information, I can use that. If not, proceed with the web search. But since the user expects an     
accurate answer, I should prioritize the wiki tool first.                                                                           
                                                                                                                                    
Let me write the code to call the wiki tool with the query "capital of Finland".                                                    
</think>                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                    
Thought: I will use the `wiki` tool to find the capital of Finland.

Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Finland. Earlier, I tried using the wiki tool but got an error because the tool wasn't  
allowed. Now I need to figure out another way to get the answer without using the wiki function.                                    
                                                                                                                                    
Since the allowed tools are web_search and visit_webpage, maybe I can use web_search with the query "capital of Finland". Let me try
that. I'll make sure to use the correct tool and structure the code properly. Let's execute the web search to find the answer.
