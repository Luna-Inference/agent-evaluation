<think>                                                                                     
Okay, the user wants to know a mammal that can fly. Let me think about this. I remember that
there are some animals that are mammals and can fly. The most obvious one is the bat. Bats  
are definitely mammals and they have wings, right? They use echolocation to navigate and    
hunt. So, the answer should be bats. But maybe there are others? Like flying squirrels?     
Wait, flying squirrels are squirrels, not mammals? No, they are mammals because they have   
fur and give birth to live young. But do they fly? Hmm, they have a slimy coat that helps   
them glide between trees. So they can glide but not fly like birds. So the primary answer is
bats. I should confirm this with a quick search to make sure. Let me use the web search tool
to check.                                                                                   
</think>                                                                                    
                                                                                            
Thought: I will use the web search tool to confirm which mammal can fly and then provide the
answer.

[Which Mammals Can Fly? - A-Z 
Animals](https://a-z-animals.com/articles/which-mammals-can-fly/)
Some mammals such as sugar gliders and flying squirrels are capable of gliding from place to
place, thanks to a membrane called a patagium. The patagium is attached to their limbs and 
serves as a sort of parachute. Gliding can be gravitational or soaring. Mammals that glide 
do so gravitationally, which means they launch themselves at their target, and then let the 
wind help them get there.

As stated above, there are some mammals which can't technically fly, but which have an 
ability which is rare among any type of animal.Northern flying squirrels are one of them. 
They have well-developed eyes which is important as they are nocturnal animals.The ability 
to glide is thanks to a patagium which is attached to the animal's side.
