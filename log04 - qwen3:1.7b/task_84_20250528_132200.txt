<think>                                                                                                                             
Okay, the user is asking about the main ingredient in sushi. I need to figure out what that is. From what I remember, sushi is      
typically made with rice, but I should verify this.                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                    
First, I should check if there's a tool available to look up this information. The available tools are web_search and visit_webpage.
Let me use web_search with the query "main ingredient in sushi".                                                                    
                                                                                                                                    
Wait, the user might be looking for the most common ingredient, which is rice. But maybe there are other ingredients like fish,     
vegetables, or soy sauce. However, the main one is usually rice. I should confirm this with a search.                               
                                                                                                                                    
So, I'll perform a web search for the main ingredient in sushi. Then, based on the results, I can determine the answer. If the      
search returns that rice is the main ingredient, I can present that. If there's more context, like different types of sushi, I need 
to clarify. But the standard answer is rice.                                                                                        
</think>                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                    
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the main ingredient in sushi.

Okay, so the user asked, "What is the main ingredient in sushi?" Based on the web search results, I need to determine the answer.   
The search results mention that sushi rice is a main ingredient, but there are other components like nori, fish, and vinegar.

sushi.                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                    
Looking at the results, the first source says "rice vinegar is pretty easy to find and even easier to use," but another source

Sushi rice, or sushi-meshi, is the base that holds everything together. Even if other ingredients are important, the rice is        
essential. The answer should highlight rice as the main ingredient, even though there are other components. The search results also 
mention that the rice is seasoned with vinegar, sugar, and salt, which adds to its flavor.
