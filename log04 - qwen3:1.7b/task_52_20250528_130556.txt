Okay, the user is asking for the national language of Brazil. I need to figure out how to   
get this information. Let me think about the tools available.                               
                                                                                            
The available tools are web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer. So maybe I can use     
web_search to look up the national language of Brazil. Let me check the rules: I can use the
web_search function with a query. The query should be something like "national language of  
Brazil".                                                                                    
                                                                                            
I should call web_search with the query "national language of Brazil". Then, the result will
be the top search results. Once I have that information, I can use the final_answer tool to 
present the answer.                                                                         
                                                                                            
Wait, the user might expect the answer to be something like Portuguese. But I need to make  
sure. Let me execute the code to get the correct information.                               
</think>
