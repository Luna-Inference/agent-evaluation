<think>                                                                                                                             
Okay, the user is asking who discovered X-rays. I need to find the answer using the tools available. Let me think about the steps.  
                                                                                                                                    
First, I should use the web search tool to look up the discovery of X-rays. The query should be straightforward. Maybe something    
like "Who discovered X-rays?".                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                    
Wait, the tools provided include web_search and visit_webpage. So I can call web_search with the query. Then, I can parse the       
results to find the answer. But since the tools don't have a direct return format, I'll have to handle the output accordingly.      
                                                                                                                                    
Alternatively, maybe the web_search function returns the top result, which would be the answer. So I can print the result and then  
extract the name from it. Let me write the code.                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                    
Code:                                                                                                                               
```py                                                                                                                               
result = web_search(query="Who discovered X-rays?")                                                                                 
print(result)                                                                                                                       
```                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                    
But the user might expect the answer to be extracted from the result. Since the observation will show the result, I can then parse  
it. However, the code needs to end with

  print(result)

Okay, so the user asked who discovered X-rays. From the web search results, the answer is clearly Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen. The       
observation shows multiple sources mentioning him. The code was executed, and the result was the search results. Since the          
observation doesn't have a specific answer but the search results list Röntgen, I need to extract that information.                 
                                                                                                                                    
The code used web_search with the query "Who discovered X-rays?" and the output is the links and text describing Röntgen. The final 
answer should be the name of the person, which is Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen. I should confirm that the search results consistently     
mention him and then provide the answer.
