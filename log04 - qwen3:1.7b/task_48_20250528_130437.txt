Okay, the user is asking for the hardest natural substance. I need to figure out how to find
this information. Let's think about the tools available. The previous examples used web     
searches and wiki looks, so maybe I can use a web search here.                              
                                                                                            
First, I should perform a search to find the answer. The question is about the hardest      
natural substance, so I'll use the web_search function with the query "hardest natural      
substance". The result will give me the answer. Once I have the answer, I can present it    
using the final_answer tool.                                                                
                                                                                            
I need to make sure the search is accurate. The answer might be something like diamond, but 
I should verify it. Let me check the search results. If the search returns that diamond is  
the hardest, then I can confirm that. Otherwise, maybe it's something else like corundum or 
another mineral. But since the user wants the answer, I'll proceed with the first result    
from the search.                                                                            
</think>                                                                                    
                                                                                            
Thought: I will use the web search tool to find the hardest natural substance and then      
return the final answer.

hardest_substance = web_search(query="hardest natural substance")
