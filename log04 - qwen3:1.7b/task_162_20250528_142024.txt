Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Slovakia. I need to figure out how to get this information. Let me think about the tools
I have available.                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                    
The available tools are web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer. Since the user wants the capital, which is a factual question, 
I can use the web_search tool to look up the answer.                                                                                
                                                                                                                                    
First, I should perform a web search for "capital of Slovakia". The web_search function will return the top results. Then, I can    
extract the capital from the search results.                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                    
Wait, the tools don't have a specific function for extracting information from search results. So I'll have to rely on the          
web_search result directly. The search results might include a direct answer, like "Bratislava" or something similar.               
                                                                                                                                    
I'll code a web search for the capital of Slovakia. If the search returns the answer, I can use that. If not, maybe I need to visit 
the webpage and parse the content. But since the user's tools don't include a parser, I'll assume the search result contains the    
answer.                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                    
So the code would be something like:                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                    
pope_age_wiki = wiki(query="current pope age")                                                                                      
print("Pope age as per wikipedia:", pope_age_wiki)                                                                                  
pope_age_search = web_search(query="current pope age")                                                                              
print("Pope age as per google search:", pope_age_search)                                                                            
                                                                                                                                    
But for this question, it's simpler. Just use web_search with the query "capital of Slovakia".                                      
                                                                                                                                    
Wait, the user's question is straightforward. Let me check the tools again. The web_search function returns the top results, so I   
can directly use that. The answer should be the first result.                                                                       
                                                                                                                                    
So the code would be:                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                    
result = web_search(query="capital of Slovakia")                                                                                    
final_answer(result)                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                    
But I need to make sure that the web_search returns the correct answer. If the search result is "Bratislava", then that's the       
answer. Otherwise, maybe there's a need to visit a specific page. However, since the user's tools don't include a parser, I'll      
proceed with the web_search and assume the first result is correct.                                                                 
                                                                                                                                    
Therefore, the code would be:                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                    
Code:                                                                                                                               
```py                                                                                                                               
result = web_search(query="capital of Slovakia")                                                                                    
final_answer(result)
