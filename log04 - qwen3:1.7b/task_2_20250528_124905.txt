<think>                                                                                     
Okay, the user is asking who wrote "Pride and Prejudice". I need to find the author of this 
classic novel. Let me think about the tools I have. The available tools are web_search,     
visit_webpage, and final_answer.                                                            
                                                                                            
First, I should use web_search to look up the author of "Pride and Prejudice". The query    
should be straightforward. Maybe something like "who wrote Pride and Prejudice".            
                                                                                            
I'll call the web_search function with that query. Then, the results should give me the     
author's name. Once I have that, I can use the final_answer tool to present the answer.     
                                                                                            
Wait, I need to make sure the search is accurate. Sometimes, search results can be          
ambiguous, but in this case, it's a well-known book. The author is Jane Austen. But I should
verify through the search results.                                                          
                                                                                            
So the steps are: perform a web search for the author of "Pride and Prejudice", extract the 
relevant information, and then return the answer. Let me write the code for that.           
</think>                                                                                    
                                                                                            
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the author of "Pride and Prejudice" and then
return the final answer.
