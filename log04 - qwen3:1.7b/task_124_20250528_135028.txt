<think>                                                                                                                             
Okay, the user is asking for the chemical symbol of helium. Let me think about how to approach this.                                
                                                                                                                                    
First, I know that helium is a noble gas, and its symbol is He. But maybe I should verify this using a reliable source. Since the   
tools available include web search, I can use the web_search function to check the exact answer.                                    
                                                                                                                                    
So the plan is to perform a web search for "chemical symbol for helium" and retrieve the top result. Then, extract the symbol from  
the search results.                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                    
I'll write a code snippet that uses the web_search tool with the query "chemical symbol for helium". The result should give the     
correct symbol, which is He. Then I can print the answer.                                                                           
</think>                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                    
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the chemical symbol for helium.
