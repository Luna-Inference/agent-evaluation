<think>                                                                                                                             
Okay, I need to find out the main ingredient in moussaka. Let me think about how to approach this. Moussaka is a traditional Greek  
dish, so I should look for reliable sources. Maybe check a recipe or a food database.                                               
                                                                                                                                    
First, I'll use the web search tool to find information about the ingredients of moussaka. The query should be something like "main 
ingredient in moussaka". Let me perform a web search to get the top results.                                                        
                                                                                                                                    
Once I get the search results, I need to parse them to find the main ingredient. The results might list the ingredients, so I'll    
look for a section that mentions the ingredients. The main ingredient is usually the first one listed, but I should verify.         
                                                                                                                                    
If the search returns a recipe or a food article, I can extract the ingredients. If there's a list of ingredients, the main one     
would be the primary component. For example, if the search result says "moussaka is made with eggplant, potatoes, and a sauce," then
the main ingredient would be eggplant.                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                    
I should also consider if there are any common ingredients that are typically included. Sometimes, the main ingredient might be the 
primary component, like the eggplant in this case. But I need to confirm from the search results.                                   
                                                                                                                                    
Once I have the information, I can use the final_answer tool to provide the answer.                                                 
</think>
