Okay, the user is asking for the chemical symbol of tin. I need to figure out what that is. From what I remember, tin is a metal    
used in various applications. The chemical symbol for tin is Sn. But wait, maybe I should verify this to be sure. Let me check using
a reliable source.                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                    
Hmm, the tools available include web search. So I should use the web_search function to look up the chemical symbol for tin. The    
query would be "chemical symbol for tin". Let me perform that search.
