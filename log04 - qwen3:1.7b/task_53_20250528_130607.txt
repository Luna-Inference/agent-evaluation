Okay, the user is asking for the sum of the angles in a triangle. Let me think about how to 
approach this.                                                                              
                                                                                            
First, I remember from geometry that in any triangle, the sum of the interior angles is     
always 180 degrees. But maybe they want a more detailed explanation or a mathematical proof?
Wait, the question is straightforward. The answer is well-known, but perhaps I should verify
it using a tool.                                                                            
                                                                                            
Looking at the tools available, there's the 'wiki' function. I can use it to look up the    
property of triangles. Let me check the wiki for "sum of angles in a triangle". The wiki    
should return that the sum is 180 degrees. Alternatively, maybe the web search tool can     
provide the same information. But since the user might expect a direct answer, using the    
wiki tool would be efficient.                                                               
                                                                                            
So, the steps would be: use the wiki tool with the query "sum of angles in a triangle",     
retrieve the information, and then present the answer. Since the answer is a simple fact,   
the code would be straightforward.                                                          
</think>                                                                                    
                                                                                            
Thought: I will use the `wiki` tool to confirm the sum of the angles in a triangle.         
Code:                                                                                       
```py                                                                                       
triangle_angles_sum = wiki(query="sum of angles in a triangle")                             
final_answer(f"The sum of the angles in a triangle is {triangle_angles_sum} degrees.")      
```

Okay, the user is asking for the sum of the angles in a triangle. From my knowledge, this is
a fundamental geometric fact. The sum is always 180 degrees. But since the previous attempt 
tried using a forbidden tool, I need to find another way to confirm this without relying on 
external functions.                                                                         
                                                                                            
Since the tools available are limited to the ones specified, like web search, visiting      
webpages, and final answer, I can explain the answer directly without executing any code.   
The user probably expects a straightforward answer based on general knowledge. The error    
occurred because using the wiki tool was not allowed, so I'll just state the answer         
explicitly.

Thought: I will provide the answer directly based on general geometric knowledge since the  
previous tool attempt was unsuccessful.                                                     
Code:                                                                                       
```py                                                                                       
final_answer("The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.")                         
```

Out - Final answer: The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.
