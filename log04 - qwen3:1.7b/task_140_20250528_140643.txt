Okay, the user is asking who discovered insulin. I need to find the answer using the tools available. Let me think about the steps. 
                                                                                                                                    
First, I should check if there's a tool that can search for historical discoveries. The tools provided include web_search and       
visit_webpage. Maybe a web search would be effective here. The query should be "who discovered insulin".                            
                                                                                                                                    
I'll use the web_search function with that query. Then, I'll look at the results to find the author. The results might list the     
discoverer. Once I have the information, I can present it as the final answer.
