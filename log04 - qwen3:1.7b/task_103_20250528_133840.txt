Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Turkey. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have. The       
available tools are web_search and visit_webpage, which can retrieve information from the internet. Since the question is           
straightforward, I can use a web search to find the answer.                                                                         
                                                                                                                                    
First, I'll use the web_search function with the query "capital of Turkey". The result should give the answer directly. Once I get  
the top result, I can extract the capital from there. Let me write the code to perform the search and then process the response.
