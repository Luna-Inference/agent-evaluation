<think>                                                                                     
Okay, the user is asking for the chemical symbol of gold. I need to figure out what that is.
From what I remember, gold is a metal, and its symbol is Au. But maybe I should verify this 
using a reliable source.                                                                    
                                                                                            
Wait, the tools available include web search and wiki. So perhaps I can use the web_search  
function to look up the chemical symbols. Let me think. The user might want the correct     
symbol, so a web search would be appropriate here.                                          
                                                                                            
I should construct a query like "chemical symbol for gold" and use the web_search tool.     
Then, the result should give the correct answer. Once I get the result, I can extract the   
symbol and return it.                                                                       
</think>                                                                                    
                                                                                            
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the chemical symbol for gold.               
Code:                                                                                       
```py                                                                                       
gold_symbol = web_search(query="chemical symbol for gold")                                  
final_answer(gold_symbol)                                                                   
```
