<think>                                                                                                                             
Okay, the user is asking who wrote "War and Peace." I need to figure out how to find this information. Let me think about the tools 
available.                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                    
The available tools are web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer. Since the user is asking for a straightforward fact, maybe a   
web search would work. But I should check if there's a more direct way. However, the tools don't include a specific database query  
tool, so web_search is the best option here.                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                    
I should use the web_search function with the query "who wrote War and Peace." That should return the top results. Then, I can parse
the first result to find the author. The answer would be the author's name from the search result.                                  
                                                                                                                                    
Wait, the user might expect a direct answer. Let me make sure the search returns the correct information. If the search result says 
the author is Leo Tolstoy, then that's the answer. But I need to confirm the search result. So, the code would be:                  
                                                                                                                                    
Call web_search with the query, then check the first result to extract the author's name. Then use final_answer to present the      
answer.                                                                                                                             
</think>                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                    
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the author of "War and Peace" and then extract the information from the search      
result.
