Okay, the user is asking who discovered penicillin. I need to find the answer using the tools available. Let me think about the     
steps.                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                    
First, I should use the web search tool to look up the history of penicillin discovery. The query should be "who discovered         
penicillin". The tool might return a result mentioning Alexander Fleming. But I need to confirm that. Maybe there's a need to check 
multiple sources. However, the tools here are limited to the functions provided. So I'll use the web_search function with the query.
Then, extract the relevant information from the results. Since the answer is straightforward, once the search returns the correct   
information, I can finalize the answer.
