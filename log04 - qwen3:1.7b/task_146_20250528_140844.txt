Okay, the user is asking who discovered the law of universal gravitation. I need to figure out the answer. From what I remember,    
Isaac Newton is the famous one associated with this law. But maybe I should verify it.                                              
                                                                                                                                    
First, I should check if there's any other possible discoverer. Sometimes history can be tricky. The law was published in 1687 in   
Newton's "Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica." So the answer is likely Newton. But to be sure, maybe I can use a search    
tool to confirm.                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                    
Wait, the tools available include web search. So I can use the web_search function with the query "who discovered the law of        
universal gravitation." Let me do that. If the search returns Newton, then that's the answer. If there's a different result, I need 
to adjust. But given the historical context, Newton is the correct answer. Let me proceed with the code.

[Newton's law of universal gravitation - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_law_of_universal_gravitation)
Before Newton's law of gravity, there were many theories explaining gravity. Philosophers made observations about things falling 
down − and developed theories why they do - as early as Aristotle who thought that rocks fall to the ground because seeking the 
ground was an essential part of their nature. [6]Around 1600, the scientific method began to take root.
