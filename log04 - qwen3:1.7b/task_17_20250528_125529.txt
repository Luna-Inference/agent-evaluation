<think>                                                                                     
Okay, the user is asking for the tallest mountain in the world. I need to figure out how to 
get that information. Let me think about the tools available.                               
                                                                                            
The tools mentioned are web_search and visit_webpage, which can be used to look up          
information. Also, there's the final_answer tool to present the result.                     
                                                                                            
First, I should use the web_search function with the query "tallest mountain in the world"  
to find the top result. The top result might be a website that lists the tallest mountains. 
Then, I can extract the relevant information from that result.                              
                                                                                            
Wait, the user might expect a specific answer, like Mount Everest. But I need to confirm the
latest data. Let me check the web search results. If the search returns that Mount Everest  
is the tallest, then I can use final_answer to state that. If there's a different result, I 
might need to check another source. But since the user's task is to answer based on the     
tools available, I'll proceed with the first search result.                                 
                                                                                            
So, the code would be to perform a web search for the query, then print the result, and     
finally answer with the found information. Let me structure the code step by step.          
</think>                                                                                    
                                                                                            
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the tallest mountain in the world and then  
return the final answer.                                                                    
Code:                                                                                       
```py                                                                                       
tallest_mountain = web_search(query="tallest mountain in the world")                        
final_answer(tallest_mountain)                                                              
```
