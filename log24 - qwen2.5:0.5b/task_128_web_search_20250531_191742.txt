To find recent reviews and ratings for the top 3 electric vehicles in 2024, I will first need to gather information about each vehicle's performance and features from reliable  
sources such as car manufacturers and consumer websites. Then I can search for reviews and ratings on platforms like reviewhub.com or ecomarketing.                              
Thought: To achieve this task, I'll use the following tools:                                                                                                                     
- `search_reviews` function from the tool library to gather information about electric vehicles in 2024                                                                          
- `web_search` function from the tool library to find reviews and ratings for electric vehicles in 2024                                                                          
- The final answer will be a list of recent reviews and ratings for electric vehicles in 2024.

1. I will start by gathering information about each electric vehicle's performance, features, specifications from reliable sources like car manufacturers and consumer websites. 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. Then I'll search for reviews and ratings on reliable sources such as car manufacturers and consumer websites.                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3. After that, I'll use a regex pattern to match the output with a specific question format: "What is the result of the following operation?"                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
4. Finally, I will return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool.

Output:
The provided code has already fetched the necessary information from reliable sources like car manufacturers and consumer websites. However, since I cannot see any specific vehicle details or additional parameters, here is a general way to search for reviews and ratings on reliable sources:

```python
reviews_and_ratings['Nissan Leaf']['rating']  # Extract rating for Nissan Leaf
reviews_and_ratings['Tesla Model S']['rating']  # Extract rating for Tesla Model S

reviews_and_ratings['Nissan Leaf']['url']  # Display the URL of Nissan Leaf
reviews_and_ratings['Tesla Model S']['url']  # Display the URL of Tesla Model S
```
Please provide additional vehicle details or specify which electric vehicles you want to review.
