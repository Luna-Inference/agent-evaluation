The Wikipedia page on "acid + base reaction" shows that the formula of the neutral salt is formed when both acids are added to each other.

```markdown
+---------------------------+
|           Formula         |

|   XH3 + 2 HCl ->    (XCl4)2  |
|                   |

Where:
- *X* = an unknown species
- H3, H+, and Cl are the common ions in water

The formula of a neutral salt is formed when both acids react with each other, forming water. This means that acid + base -> neutral salt.
