[Renewable energy - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy)
Renewable energy (also called green energy) is energy made from renewable natural resources that are replenished on a human timescale. The most widely used renewable energy 
types are solar energy, wind power, and hydropower. Bioenergy and geothermal power are also significant in some countries.

[Renewable Energy - Department of Energy](https://www.energy.gov/topics/renewable-energy)
Renewable energy comes from naturally occurring resources that are continuously replenished. It generates over 20% of all U.S. electricity, and that percentage continues to 
grow. The United States is a resource-rich country with enough renewable energy resources to generate more than 100 times the amount of electricity Americans use each year.

[Renewable energy | Types, Advantages, & Facts | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/science/renewable-energy)
Renewable energy, usable energy derived from replenishable sources such as the Sun (solar energy), wind (wind power), rivers (hydroelectric power), hot springs (geothermal 
energy), tides (tidal power), and biomass (biofuels). Several forms have become price competitive with energy derived from fossil fuels.

[Renewable energy explained - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/renewable-sources/)
Renewable energy can play an important role in U.S. energy security and in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Using renewable energy can help to reduce energy imports and fossil
fuel use, the largest source of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions.According to projections in the Annual Energy Outlook 2023 Reference case, U.S. renewable energy consumption will 
continue to increase through 2050.

[Renewable energy - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy)
Renewable energy (also called green energy) is energy made from renewable natural resources that are replenished on a human timescale. The most widely used renewable energy 
types are solar energy, wind power, and hydropower. Bioenergy and geothermal power are also significant in some countries.

[Renewable Energy - Department of Energy](https://www.energy.gov/topics/renewable-energy)
Renewable energy comes from naturally occurring resources that are continuously replenished. It generates over 20% of all U.S. electricity, and that percentage continues to 
grow. The United States is a resource-rich country with enough renewable energy resources to generate more than 100 times the amount of electricity Americans use each year.

[Renewable energy | Types, Advantages, & Facts | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/science/renewable-energy)
Renewable energy, usable energy derived from replenishable sources such as the Sun (solar energy), wind (wind power), rivers (hydroelectric power), hot springs (geothermal 
energy), tides (tidal power), and biomass (biofuels). Several forms have become price competitive with energy derived from fossil fuels.

[Renewable energy explained - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/renewable-sources/)
Renewable energy can play an important role in U.S. energy security and in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Using renewable energy can help to reduce energy imports and fossil
fuel use, the largest source of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions.According to projections in the Annual Energy Outlook 2023 Reference case, U.S. renewable energy consumption will 
continue to increase through 2050.
