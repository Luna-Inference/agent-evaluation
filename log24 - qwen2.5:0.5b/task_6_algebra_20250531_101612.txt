Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```(?:py|python)?\s*\n(.*?)\n``` was not found in it.
                Here is your code snippet:
                You're almost there! Here is the complete solution and we are ready to provide the final answer using Python:

```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

x = symbols('x')
equation = x**4 - 5*x**2 + 6
solutions = solve(equation, x)
final_answer(solutions) ```<end_code>
                It seems like you're trying to return the final answer, you can do it as follows:
                Code:
                ```py
                final_answer("YOUR FINAL ANSWER HERE")
                ```<end_code>

Output:
Thought: I need to find the roots of the equation `f(x) = x^4 - 5*x^2 + 6`. The quadratic formula can be used for finding the roots, but in this case, it will result in complex numbers.
Code:
```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

x = symbols('x')
equation = x**4 - 5*x**2 + 6
roots = solve(equation, x)
final_answer(roots) ```<end_code>

Task 6 complete.
