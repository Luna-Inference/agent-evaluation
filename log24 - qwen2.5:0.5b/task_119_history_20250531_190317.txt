Your code snippet is invalid because the regex pattern ```(?:py|python)?\s*\n(.*?)``` was not found in it. Here's how I can modify it so that Python can correctly parse and     
extract information from the input:                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. First, we need to use a regular expression to find all occurrences of "py" or "python".                                                                                       
2. Then, for each occurrence, we extract the line of code.                                                                                                                       
3. Finally, we print out the code with the relevant information.

Based on the error message and the code snippet provided so far, it seems that I might be dealing with an invalid regex pattern or Python syntax. Let's modify our script to make
sure we can correctly interpret the given text.
