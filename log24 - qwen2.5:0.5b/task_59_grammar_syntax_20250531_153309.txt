Code:

```py

relativity_1 = "He has always been a student."

relative_2 = "She was born in 1975."
relativity_2 = "It rains heavily today."

final_answer("Restrictive relative clause: 'She was born in 1975.'"
"Non-restrictive relative clause: 'The man who is a member of the party.'
'He has always been a student.'
'related to main clause"
"in effect, not stated explicitly")
