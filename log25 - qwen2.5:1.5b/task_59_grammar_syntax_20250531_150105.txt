Thought: To understand the differences between restrictive and non-restrictive relative clauses, I need to examine two sentences that contain each type of clause. I will use a  
library called `collections` to keep track of where in the sentence each word appears.

Thought: I can now compare the two sentences' structures to identify which words are essential to understanding their meaning and which are not. This will help me explain how   
restrictive clauses differ from non-restrictive ones.

Thought: Now that I have the information from both sentences, I can explain how restrictive and non-restrictive clauses differ. A restrictive relative clause provides essential 
information about its antecedent (the noun it refers to), so a sentence must include this additional information for full understanding. On the other hand, a non-restrictive    
relative clause supplies only supplementary or optional details that do not affect comprehension of the main idea.

print(f"The book {sentence_1[restrictive_index_1[-1] + 1]} is about dinosaurs, {sentence_1[len(sentence_1) - 1]}, but the one I was reading was specifically about dinosaurs.")

Thought: To summarize, restrictive relative clauses provide essential information to fully understand their meaning while non-restrictive ones add supplementary details that do 
not change the main idea of a sentence.
