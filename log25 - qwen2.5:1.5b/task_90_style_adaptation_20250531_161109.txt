Execution logs:
Hello little one! Today, we're going to talk about something very special - the age of the pope. The pope is like the head of the Catholic Church, just like how you have a 
parent who's in charge of your household.
Imagine if someone asked you what your age was and you replied that it's 88 years old because you've been around for a long time! That's kind of what happened with Pope Francis.
He has an amazing life span.
Now, let's think about something fun. How would 88 years old compare with your age? That means you're 10 times older than a grandma is!
So, if we ask 'What's 88 raised to the power of 0.36?', it's asking how many hours that age would take up! Just like counting by ones, but even more quickly because 0.36 is 
closer to one.
The answer to the mathematical question would be about as many hours as it takes to count to infinity! That's almost impossible to imagine!
So, to sum it up: Pope Francis, who has lived for 88 years, makes him an incredible old man! And counting from one to infinity is quite a big deal!

Hello little one! Today, we're going to talk about something very special - the age of the pope. The pope is like the head of the Catholic Church, just like how you have a 
parent who's in charge of your household.
Now, let's think about something fun. How would 88 years old compare with your age? That means you're 10 times older than a grandma is!
So, if we ask 'What's 88 raised to the power of 0.36?', it's asking how many hours that age would take up! Just like counting by ones, but even more quickly because 0.36 is 
closer to one.
The answer to the mathematical question would be about as many hours as it takes to count to infinity! That's almost impossible to imagine!
So, to sum it up: Pope Francis, who has lived for 88 years, makes him an incredible old man! And counting from one to infinity is quite a big deal!
