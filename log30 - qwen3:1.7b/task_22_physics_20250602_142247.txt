Okay, the user is asking for the formula for kinetic energy. Let me think about how to approach this.                                         
                                                                                                                                              
First, I know that kinetic energy is the energy an object has due to its motion. The formula is usually written as KE = (1/2)mv², where m is  
mass and v is velocity. But I need to make sure I'm correct. Maybe I should verify the formula using a reliable source.                       
                                                                                                                                              
Since the user didn't specify any particular context, like physics notation or units, I'll assume standard SI units. The formula is indeed KE 
= (1/2)mv². But perhaps I should check if there's a different form, like in different units or with different variables. For example, in some 
contexts, they might use different symbols, but the fundamental formula remains the same.                                                     
                                                                                                                                              
I should also consider if there's a need to explain the components. The user might want to know each part of the formula. However, the        
question is just asking for the formula, not an explanation. So I just need to provide the formula itself.                                    
                                                                                                                                              
Wait, the tools available include web search and wiki. Maybe I can use the web_search tool to confirm the formula. Let me check if there's a  
standard source. For instance, searching for "kinetic energy formula" should return the standard formula. But since the user is asking for the
formula, I can directly provide it. However, if the tools are available, using them would be better. But in this case, since the user is just 
asking for the formula, maybe the assistant can answer directly without using tools. But according to the rules, the assistant should use the 
tools if possible. But in this case, the assistant might not need to use any tools because the knowledge is common.                           
                                                                                                                                              
But the assistant's tools include web_search and wiki. So perhaps the assistant should use web_search to confirm the formula. Let me think.   
The assistant can perform a web search for "kinetic energy formula" and retrieve the result. Then, present the formula as the answer.         
                                                                                                                                              
So the steps would be: use the web_search tool with the query "kinetic energy formula", get the top result, extract the formula, and then     
return it. But since the assistant can't actually perform the search here, the code would simulate that. However, in the code, the assistant  
would write the code to perform the search and then process the result.                                                                       
                                                                                                                                              
But in the previous examples, when the assistant needed to find a specific answer, they used the tools. So here, the assistant should use the 
web_search tool to find the formula. Then, in the code, after getting the result, extract the formula and return it.                          
                                                                                                                                              
So the code would be something like:                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                              
search_result = web_search("kinetic energy formula")                                                                                          
print(search_result)                                                                                                                          
final_answer(search_result)                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                              
But since the assistant can't actually perform the search here, the code would be written accordingly. However, in the actual execution, the  
code would run and return the result. The assistant's answer would then be the extracted formula.                                             
                                                                                                                                              
Alternatively, if the assistant knows the formula from their knowledge, they can directly answer. But since the task is to use the tools if   
possible, the assistant should proceed with the web search.                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                              
Therefore, the code would be:                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                              
Code:                                                                                                                                         
```py                                                                                                                                         
search_result = web_search("kinetic energy formula")                                                                                          
final_answer(search_result)                                                                                                                   
```                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                              
But the assistant needs to make sure that the search returns the correct formula. However, in the absence of actual tool execution, the       
assistant's answer would be based on their knowledge. But according to the rules, the assistant should use the tools when possible. So the    
correct approach is to use the web_search tool to find the formula and then present it.                                                       
</think>                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                              
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the formula for kinetic energy and then return the result.
