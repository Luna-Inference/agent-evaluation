<think>                                                                                                                                       
Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the sentence "The ball was thrown by Sarah" is active or passive voice. Hmm, I need to recall the  
differences between active and passive voices.                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                              
In active voice, the subject performs the action. So in this sentence, the subject is "The ball," and the verb is "was thrown," which is the  
past tense of "throw." The object here is "by Sarah," which is the agent. Wait, but in active voice, the subject is the one doing the action. 
So "The ball" is the subject, and "was thrown" is the verb. But the agent is "Sarah," which is the doer. Wait, no, in active voice, the       
subject is the one doing the action. So "The ball" is the subject, and "was thrown" is the verb. But the agent is "Sarah," which is the one   
doing the action. Wait, but in the sentence, the agent is introduced by "by Sarah," which is a prepositional phrase. So maybe this is passive 
voice because the subject is the receiver of the action, and the agent is introduced by "by Sarah." Wait, no, in passive voice, the subject is
the recipient, and the agent is introduced by "by." So in active voice, the subject is the one doing the action. So in this case, the sentence
"The ball was thrown by Sarah" is passive because the subject is "The ball," and the agent is "Sarah." Wait, but in active voice, the subject 
would be "Sarah," and the verb would be "threw." So the original sentence is passive because the subject is the recipient, and the agent is   
added later. So the answer should be passive voice.                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                              
But I need to confirm. Let me think again. Active voice: Subject + verb (present tense) + object. Passive voice: Object + verb (past tense) + 
agent. So in this case, the subject is "The ball," the verb is "was thrown," and the agent is "Sarah." So the structure is object + verb +    
agent. Therefore, it's passive. So the answer is passive.                                                                                     
</think>                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                              
Thought: I will use the tool `sentence_voice_analysis` to determine if the sentence is active or passive voice.

Okay, the user's question is about determining if the sentence "The ball was thrown by Sarah" is active or passive voice. The initial approach
used a hypothetical tool called sentence_voice_analysis, but that tool isn't allowed. So I need to find another way to answer this without    
using that function.                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                              
First, I should recall the difference between active and passive voice. In active voice, the subject performs the action, while in passive    
voice, the subject receives the action. The structure for passive voice often uses "be + past participle" followed by the object. For example,
"The ball was thrown by Sarah" is passive because "was thrown" is the past participle of "throw," and the subject "the ball" is receiving the 
action.                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                              
Since the allowed tools are limited to the ones provided (web search, visit_webpage, final_answer, etc.), I need to use those. Maybe I can use
the web_search tool to find a resource that explains the difference between active and passive voice. Alternatively, I can use the built-in   
Python functions to analyze the sentence structure.                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                              
Wait, the user's previous attempt used a non-existent tool, so I need to avoid that. Let me think of another approach. Since the sentence is  
straightforward, maybe I can check the subject and verb. In "The ball was thrown by Sarah," the subject is "the ball," and the verb is "was   
thrown." The agent (Sarah) is introduced with "by," which is a common feature in passive voice. So the sentence is passive.                   
                                                                                                                                              
But how to confirm this without using the forbidden tool? The user might expect me to answer based on my knowledge. Since the task is to      
determine the voice, and the user is testing if I can do it without the tool, I can directly answer based on my understanding.                
                                                                                                                                              
So the answer is passive voice. The code should just output that. But the user's previous attempt tried a function that wasn't allowed, so I  
need to avoid that. Therefore, the correct approach is to answer directly.                                                                    
</think>                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                              
The sentence "The ball was thrown by Sarah" is in passive voice because the subject ("the ball") receives the action ("was thrown") rather    
than performing it. This structure uses the auxiliary verb "was" (past tense of "be") and the past participle "thrown" to indicate passivity. 
                                                                                                                                              
Final Answer: Passive

Okay, the user is asking if the sentence "The ball was thrown by Sarah" is in active or passive voice. The previous attempt tried using a     
non-existent tool, which caused an error. Now, I need to find another way to answer this without relying on any external functions.           
                                                                                                                                              
First, I should recall the rules for active and passive voice. In active voice, the subject performs the action, while in passive voice, the  
subject receives the action. The structure for passive voice often uses "be + past participle" followed by the object. In the given sentence, 
the subject is "the ball," and the action is "was thrown." The "by Sarah" part indicates the agent, which is typical in passive voice.        
                                                                                                                                              
Since the user's previous attempt used a forbidden tool, I need to answer directly using Python code. The user's code might have had a regex  
issue, so I should ensure the code is valid. The correct approach is to check the subject and verb structure. The sentence meets the criteria 
for passive voice because the subject is receiving the action, and the agent is introduced with "by."                                         
                                                                                                                                              
I'll write a simple Python code snippet that checks the subject and verb, then outputs the answer. The code should avoid any regex patterns   
that caused the error. The final answer is straightforward based on the analysis.

Thought: I will directly answer based on my knowledge without using any tools. The sentence "The ball was thrown by Sarah" is in passive voice
because the subject ("the ball") receives the action ("was thrown") and the agent ("Sarah") is introduced with "by."                          
                                                                                                                                              
Code:

final_answer("Passive")
