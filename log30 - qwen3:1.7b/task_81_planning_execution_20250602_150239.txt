Okay, I need to figure out how to organize a surprise birthday party for 20 people within a $500 budget. Let's break this down. First, I      
should consider the different aspects of a party: venue, food, entertainment, decorations, and maybe activities. The budget is $500, so I have
to allocate this wisely.                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                              
Starting with the venue. A surprise party often requires a quiet, intimate setting. Maybe a backyard, a local restaurant, or a venue that can 
be transformed. Let's check the budget. If I choose a backyard, maybe rent a space or use a private room. But I need to estimate costs. Let's 
say a backyard venue costs around $200. That leaves $300 for other expenses.                                                                  
                                                                                                                                              
Next, food. For 20 people, a buffet might be too expensive. Maybe a catered meal for $150. That leaves $150 for other things. But maybe I can 
find a discount or use a food truck. Alternatively, maybe a picnic with food from a local vendor. Let's say $100 for food, leaving $200 for   
other expenses.                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                              
Entertainment is important. A DJ, live music, or a game night. A DJ might cost $100, leaving $100. Maybe a game night for $50, and a small    
live band for $50. That would use up the $100.                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                              
Decorations and activities. Maybe balloons, decorations, a cake. A simple setup could cost $50. Then, a small activity like a trivia game for 
$20. That leaves $30.                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                              
Wait, let me check the totals. If venue is $200, food $100, entertainment $100, decorations $50, activities $20, that's $470. There's $30     
left. Maybe use that for a small gift for guests or a last-minute addition.                                                                   
                                                                                                                                              
But I need to make sure all these items fit within $500. Let me adjust. Maybe the venue is $200, food $150, entertainment $150, decorations   
$50, activities $20. That's $470. The remaining $30 can be used for a surprise element, like a small gift or a last-minute activity.          
                                                                                                                                              
Alternatively, maybe the venue is cheaper. If I can find a free or low-cost venue, like a park or a local event space. But the user might not 
have that info. So I need to proceed with the best possible plan based on standard costs.                                                     
                                                                                                                                              
Another consideration: surprise elements. Maybe a secret location, a surprise cake, or a hidden activity. The budget allows for that.         
                                                                                                                                              
So the plan would be:                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                              
1. Venue: $200 (backyard or local space)                                                                                                      
2. Food: $150 (buffet or catered meal)                                                                                                        
3. Entertainment: $150 (DJ, live music, game night)                                                                                           
4. Decorations: $50 (balloons, decorations, cake)                                                                                             
5. Activities: $20 (trivia, game)                                                                                                             
6. Extra: $30 (gifts or last-minute stuff)                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                              
Total: 200+150+150+50+20=470. The remaining $30 can be used for a surprise element.                                                           
                                                                                                                                              
I need to present this step-by-step plan, ensuring all costs are within the budget and the surprise elements are included.

Thought: I will plan the party step by step, allocating the $500 budget to venue, food, entertainment, decorations, and activities, ensuring  
the surprise elements are included within the budget.
