Okay, the user wants me to parse this complex sentence and find all subordinate clauses. The sentence is: "Although he knew that the project, 
which had been delayed multiple times, would require extensive revisions, he remained optimistic about meeting the deadline."                 
                                                                                                                                              
First, I need to understand the structure of the sentence. Let's break it down. The main clause is "he remained optimistic about meeting the  
deadline." The subordinate clause is "Although he knew that the project, which had been delayed multiple times, would require extensive       
revisions."                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                              
So the subordinate clause here is introduced by "Although" and contains a relative clause "which had been delayed multiple times." The main   
clause is the rest of the sentence.                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                              
I should identify the subordinate clauses. The main clause is the second part, and the subordinate clause is the first part. The subordinate  
clause has its own subordinate clauses. The relative clause "which had been delayed multiple times" is a subordinate clause within the main   
clause.                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                              
Wait, but the user asked for all subordinate clauses. So the main clause is "he remained optimistic..." and the subordinate clause is         
"Although he knew...". Then, within that subordinate clause, there's another subordinate clause: "which had been delayed multiple times."     
                                                                                                                                              
So the answer should list both subordinate clauses. Let me make sure I'm not missing any. The sentence has two subordinate clauses: the main  
one and the relative one. The relative clause is itself a subordinate clause. So the total is two subordinate clauses.                        
</think>                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                              
Thought: I will parse the sentence to identify subordinate clauses. The sentence has two subordinate clauses: the main clause "he remained    
optimistic..." and the subordinate clause "Although he knew...". The relative clause "which had been delayed..." is another subordinate clause
within the main clause.
