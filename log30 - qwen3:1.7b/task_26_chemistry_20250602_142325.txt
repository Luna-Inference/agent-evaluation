Okay, I need to balance the chemical equation C₂H₆ + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O. Let me think about how to approach this.                                 
                                                                                                                                              
First, I remember that to balance a chemical equation, the number of atoms of each element on both sides must be equal. So, I need to make    
sure the number of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms are the same on both sides.                                                             
                                                                                                                                              
Let me start with carbon. On the left side, there are 2 carbon atoms in C₂H₆. On the right side, each CO₂ has 1 carbon, so if I have x        
molecules of CO₂, there will be x carbon atoms. To balance carbon, x should be 2. So, I'll write 2 CO₂ on the product side.                   
                                                                                                                                              
Next, hydrogen. The left side has 6 hydrogen atoms in C₂H₆. On the right side, each H₂O has 2 hydrogens. So, if I have y molecules of H₂O,    
there will be 2y hydrogen atoms. To balance hydrogen, 2y should be 6, so y is 3. Therefore, I'll have 3 H₂O on the product side.              
                                                                                                                                              
Now, the equation looks like C₂H₆ + O₂ → 2 CO₂ + 3 H₂O.                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                              
Now, let's check the oxygen atoms. On the left side, each O₂ molecule has 2 oxygen atoms. So, if there's z moles of O₂, there are 2z oxygen   
atoms. On the right side, each CO₂ has 2 oxygen atoms (2*2=4) and each H₂O has 1 oxygen atom (3*1=3). So total oxygen on the right is 2 + 3 = 
5. Therefore, 2z = 5. Wait, that's 2z = 5, which would mean z is 2.5. But oxygen should be a whole number. Hmm, maybe I need to adjust the    
coefficients.                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                              
Wait, the equation is C₂H₆ + O₂ → 2 CO₂ + 3 H₂O. Let's count the oxygen atoms again. On the left, each O₂ has 2, so total oxygen is 2z. On the
right, 2 CO₂ has 2*2=4 oxygen atoms, and 3 H₂O has 3*1=3. Total 4+3=7. So 2z = 7 → z = 3.5. That's a fraction, which is not ideal. But maybe I
can multiply all coefficients by 2 to eliminate the fraction. Let's see:                                                                      
                                                                                                                                              
If I multiply all coefficients by 2, the equation becomes 2 C₂H₆ + 7 O₂ → 4 CO₂ + 6 H₂O. Now, checking oxygen atoms: left side is 2*7=14      
oxygen atoms. Right side is 4*2 + 6*1 = 8 +6=14. That works. But wait, the original equation was C₂H₆ + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O. So, if I multiply by  
2, the balanced equation would be 2 C₂H₆ + 7 O₂ → 4 CO₂ + 6 H₂O. But maybe the simplest form is 2 C₂H₆ + 7 O₂ → 4 CO₂ + 6 H₂O. However,       
sometimes balanced equations are written with the smallest whole numbers, so maybe 2 C₂H₆ + 7 O₂ → 4 CO₂ + 6 H₂O is the correct balanced      
equation.                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                              
Alternatively, maybe there's a way to balance it without fractions. Let me check again.                                                       
                                                                                                                                              
Original equation: C₂H₆ + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O.                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                              
Let me try using coefficients. Let me denote the coefficients as a, b, c, d for the reactants and products.                                   
                                                                                                                                              
So:                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                              
a C₂H₆ + b O₂ → c CO₂ + d H₂O.                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                              
Balancing carbon: a = c.                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                              
Balancing hydrogen: 6a = 2d → 3a = d.                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                              
Balancing oxygen: 2b = 2c + d.                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                              
Substituting c = a and d = 3a into the oxygen equation:                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                              
2b = 2a + 3a → 2b = 5a → b = (5/2)a.                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                              
So, to make b a whole number, a must be even. Let's take a=2. Then b=5. So the equation becomes:                                              
                                                                                                                                              
2 C₂H₆ + 5 O₂ → 2 CO₂ + 3 H₂O.                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                              
Wait, but earlier when I tried with a=2, I had 2z=5, which would make z=2.5. But here, with a=2, b=5, the oxygen balance is 2*5 = 10 on the   
left, and 2*2 + 3*1 = 7 on the right. Wait, that doesn't add up. Wait, no, the oxygen balance equation is 2b = 2c + d. If c = a=2, d=3a=6,    
then 2b = 2*2 +6 = 10 → b=5. So left side oxygen is 2*5=10, right side is 2*2 (from CO₂) + 6 (from H₂O) = 4 +6=10. So that works. So the      
balanced equation is 2 C₂H₆ + 5 O₂ → 2 CO₂ + 6 H₂O. Wait, earlier I thought d was 3a, but if a=2, then d=3*2=6. So the equation is 2 C₂H₆ + 5 
O₂ → 2 CO₂ + 6 H₂O. So that's balanced.                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                              
But earlier when I thought of 2 C₂H₆ + 7 O₂ → 4 CO₂ + 6 H₂O, that was a mistake. The correct coefficient for O₂ is 5, not 7. So the correct   
balanced equation is 2 C₂H₆ + 5 O₂ → 2 CO₂ + 6 H₂O.                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                              
So the balanced equation is:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                              
2 C₂H₆ + 5 O₂ → 2 CO₂ + 6 H₂O.                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                              
But maybe it's simplified further by dividing all coefficients by 2, but that would give 1 C₂H₆ + 2.5 O₂ → 1 CO₂ + 3 H₂O, which isn't whole   
numbers. So the standard balanced equation is 2 C₂H₆ + 5 O₂ → 2 CO₂ + 6 H₂O.                                                                  
                                                                                                                                              
Therefore, the answer should be this equation.
