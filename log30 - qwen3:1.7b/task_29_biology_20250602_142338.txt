<think>                                                                                                                                       
Okay, the user wants an explanation of cellular respiration and its three main stages. Let me think about how to approach this.               
                                                                                                                                              
First, I need to recall the steps of cellular respiration. From what I remember, it's the process cells use to convert glucose into energy,   
which is stored in ATP. The three main stages are glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain.                              
                                                                                                                                              
But wait, the user might expect a more detailed breakdown. Let me confirm the stages. Glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm, breaking down       
glucose into pyruvate. Then the Krebs cycle takes place in the mitochondria, generating ATP, NADH, and FADH2. Finally, the electron transport 
chain in the mitochondria uses these electrons to create a lot of ATP.                                                                        
                                                                                                                                              
I need to make sure each stage is explained clearly. Also, the user might want the process steps outlined. Since the tools available are web  
search and print, maybe I can use the web_search function to get accurate information about the stages.                                       
                                                                                                                                              
I should check if the web search can retrieve detailed information on cellular respiration stages. The previous examples used search          
functions, so perhaps using web_search with the query "cellular respiration stages" would help. Then, I can process the results to extract the
three stages and their details.                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                              
Wait, the user didn't specify whether to use the tools or just provide a general answer. But since the tools are available, maybe I should use
them to get the information. However, the assistant is supposed to use the tools in a code block. So I need to write code that uses web_search
to find the information, then process it.                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                              
But the code needs to be in Python, using the provided functions. Let me structure the code: first, perform a web search for the stages, then 
parse the results to extract the three stages. Then, print the explanation.                                                                   
                                                                                                                                              
I need to make sure the code is correct. For example, the web_search function might return a list of results. The assistant should then       
extract the relevant parts. However, the code can't be too complex, as per the rules. Also, the assistant can't use any new variables except  
those defined, so I need to manage variables properly.                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                              
Putting it all together, the code would first search for the stages, then extract the information, and finally present it in the answer. The  
final answer would be the explanation with the three stages.                                                                                  
</think>                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                              
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find detailed information about cellular respiration stages and then outline the three main stages 
in the answer.

Okay, the user asked to explain cellular respiration and its three main stages. My first attempt used the web_search tool to get information, 
but there was an error because of a ratelimit. Now I need to find another way to get the necessary information without using the same tool    
again.                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                              
Since the previous search didn't work, maybe I should use a different search engine or a different approach. But the available tools are      
limited to the ones specified. The user provided tools include web_search, which might have been rate-limited. Perhaps I can use the same tool
again but with a different query. Wait, the error message said the URL was 202 Ratelimit, which might mean the search engine is limiting the  
requests. Maybe I can try a more specific query or use a different strategy.                                                                  
                                                                                                                                              
Alternatively, maybe the information is available in the previous search results. In the first attempt, the output was something like         
"Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021." But that was for a different query. Wait, the user's task is about cellular
respiration, so maybe the initial search was too broad. Let me try a more specific query, like "cellular respiration stages explanation" to   
get more relevant results.                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                              
I should adjust the query to be more precise. Let's try that. Also, ensure that the code doesn't use the same tool again. So, the next step is
to use web_search with a different query and see if that works. If it does, then proceed to outline the three stages from the results. If not,
maybe another approach is needed, but given the tools available, this is the best next step.

Okay, the user is asking about the process of cellular respiration and its three main stages. I tried using the web_search tool with different
queries but kept getting ratelimit errors. The first attempt was too broad, leading to a 202 error. Then, I tried a more specific query, but  
that also resulted in a 202. Maybe the issue is that the search engine is rate limiting due to multiple consecutive calls.                    
                                                                                                                                              
Since the user needs the information, I need to find a way to retrieve the data without hitting the rate limit. Perhaps using a different     
search strategy, like a more efficient query or a different search engine. But the available tools only include web_search, so I have to work 
with that.                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                              
Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the queries are too similar, leading to the same error. To avoid that, I can try a more unique query.
For example, using "cellular respiration stages diagram" or "cellular respiration stages summary" to get a more concise result. Let me try    
that.                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                              
Also, the user might need the three main stages explained clearly. Once I get the search results, I can parse them to extract the stages. If  
the search returns multiple results, I'll need to pick the most relevant one. Let's proceed with a slightly different query to reduce the     
likelihood of ratelimiting.                                                                                                                   
</think>                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                              
Thought: I will try a different query to avoid ratelimiting and retrieve the information. If the search returns multiple results, I'll extract
the relevant part about cellular respiration stages.

Okay, the user is asking about the process of cellular respiration and its three main stages. I tried using the web_search tool with different
queries but kept getting ratelimit errors. The initial attempts used phrases like "cellular respiration stages," "explanation," and "diagram,"
which all resulted in rate limits.                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                              
Since the rate limit is causing issues, I need a different approach. Maybe I should focus on a more specific or well-known source. The user   
might be expecting a standard explanation, so perhaps searching for a reputable educational website or a textbook explanation would work      
better. I can try a query like "cellular respiration stages diagram" again, but maybe with a different parameter, like adding a keyword       
related to the stages.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                              
Alternatively, maybe using a different search engine or a more specific term could help. But since the user's tools only allow web_search, I  
have to stick with that. Let me try a more precise query, like "cellular respiration stages in detail" to get a more comprehensive result. If 
that doesn't work, maybe I can look for a diagram or a detailed explanation from a reliable source. Once I have the information, I can outline
the three stages: glycolysis, Krebs cycle, and electron transport chain.

Okay, so the user is trying to explain cellular respiration and its three main stages. They've tried several search queries but keep getting  
ratelimit errors. The previous attempts used phrases like "cellular respiration stages explanation," "stages diagram," and "in detail," all   
leading to 202 errors.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                              
Hmm, maybe the problem is that the search engine is limiting the number of requests. To avoid that, perhaps the user needs a different        
approach. Since the web_search tool is causing issues, maybe the assistant should try a different method. But according to the tools provided,
the only available tools are web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer. The assistant can't use other methods like direct web scraping or   
API calls.                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                              
Wait, the user might need to use the web_search function with a more efficient query. Maybe using a broader term or a different phrasing. But 
the previous attempts didn't work. Alternatively, maybe the assistant should use the already retrieved information from the previous steps.   
However, in the earlier steps, the assistant tried various queries and got errors.                                                            
                                                                                                                                              
Alternatively, maybe the assistant should use the information from the previous responses. For example, in the first attempt, the assistant   
tried "cellular respiration stages" and got a result with the first page. Even though the error occurred, maybe the assistant can try to      
extract the information from the previous response. But the assistant can't store previous responses; it has to rely on the current tools.    
                                                                                                                                              
Wait, the assistant can't store previous responses because the tools are limited. So the assistant has to keep trying different queries. But  
the user is facing ratelimit issues. Maybe the assistant should use a different approach, like using the same query but with a different      
parameter, but the tools don't allow that.                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                              
Alternatively, maybe the assistant should use the built-in knowledge to explain cellular respiration without searching. But the task says to  
use the tools, so the assistant has to rely on web_search.                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                              
Given the repeated errors, perhaps the assistant should try a different query, like "cellular respiration process" or "cellular respiration   
stages diagram" again, but with a different structure. However, the assistant has to follow the tool's parameters.                            
                                                                                                                                              
Alternatively, maybe the assistant should use the visit_webpage tool to access a specific webpage that discusses cellular respiration stages. 
But the assistant hasn't visited any pages yet.                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                              
Wait, in the previous steps, the assistant tried searching and got errors, but maybe the assistant can use the information from the first     
search attempt. For example, in the first call, the assistant got a result like "Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of   
2021." But that's about population, not cellular respiration.                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                              
Wait, the user's task is about cellular respiration, so the assistant needs to find information on that. Since the web_search is failing,     
maybe the assistant should use the built-in knowledge to explain the three stages. But the tools require using web_search.                    
                                                                                                                                              
Given the constraints, the assistant has to keep trying different queries. Maybe the assistant should try "cellular respiration stages        
diagram" again, but with a different parameter. However, the assistant can't change the query parameters.                                     
                                                                                                                                              
Alternatively, the assistant could use the same query but with a different search engine, but the tools only allow web_search.                
                                                                                                                                              
Given the repeated errors, perhaps the assistant should proceed to use the information from the first search attempt, even though it's not the
correct one. But the assistant can't do that.                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                              
In conclusion, the assistant has to keep trying different queries until it finds the correct one, even if it's causing errors. The final      
answer would be the explanation based on the retrieved information, even if the search is failing. However, since the assistant can't proceed 
without the correct search results, it might have to use the built-in knowledge. But according to the tools, the assistant must use           
web_search.                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                              
Given the time constraints, the assistant will try one more query with a different phrasing, like "cellular respiration stages in simple      
terms" to avoid the ratelimit.

Thought: I will try one last query to avoid ratelimiting and retrieve the information. If the search returns results, I'll extract the        
relevant part about cellular respiration stages.

Okay, the user is asking about the process of cellular respiration and its three main stages. I've tried several searches with different      
queries but keep getting a ratelimit error. The previous attempts used phrases like "cellular respiration stages explanation," "stages        
diagram," and "in simple terms," all leading to the same error.                                                                               
                                                                                                                                              
Since the ratelimit is causing issues, I need a different approach. Maybe I should look for a more straightforward source or use a different  
search strategy. Let me think: the three main stages are glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain. Maybe I can directly  
search for information about these stages instead of the entire process.                                                                      
                                                                                                                                              
I'll try a query that specifically mentions the three stages. Let's use "cellular respiration three stages" to get a more targeted result.    
This should reduce the likelihood of hitting the ratelimit. If the search returns results, I can extract the information about the stages and 
present it in the answer.

Okay, so the user is trying to explain cellular respiration and its three main stages. They've tried several approaches using the web_search  
tool but kept getting ratelimit errors. The problem is that each time they use web_search, it's returning a 202 Ratelimit, which means they're
being blocked from searching again.                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                              
Since the user is facing this issue, they need to find another way to get the information without using the web_search tool repeatedly. Maybe 
they can look for existing knowledge or resources that already explain cellular respiration in detail. The three main stages are usually      
glycolysis, the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle), and the electron transport chain.                                                            
                                                                                                                                              
Wait, the user might not have access to external resources, so they need to rely on their existing knowledge. But the tools available are     
limited to the functions provided, like web_search and others. Since the web_search is failing due to ratelimit, maybe the assistant should   
try a different approach.                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                              
Alternatively, the assistant could use the built-in knowledge to outline the three stages without searching. The three stages are: 1.         
Glycolysis (in cytoplasm, breaks down glucose into pyruvate), 2. Krebs Cycle (in mitochondria, produces ATP and reduce agents), and 3.        
Electron Transport Chain (in mitochondria, generates a lot of ATP).                                                                           
                                                                                                                                              
Since the user's previous attempts failed due to rate limits, the assistant should now use its own knowledge to answer the question directly. 
The final answer would be a clear explanation of the three stages, even without searching.                                                    
                                                                                                                                              
So, the assistant should proceed to outline the three stages in the answer, using the information it already has, avoiding the web_search tool
due to the rate limit issues.

Thought: I will use my existing knowledge to explain cellular respiration and its three main stages without relying on web searches due to    
rate limit issues. The three stages are glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and the electron transport chain.

Cellular respiration is the process by which cells convert glucose and oxygen into energy (ATP) and carbon dioxide. It consists of three main 
stages:                                                                                                                                       
1. **Glycolysis**: Occurs in the cytoplasm, breaking down glucose into pyruvate, producing 2 ATP and 2 NADH.                                  
2. **Citric Acid Cycle (Krebs Cycle)**: Takes place in the mitochondria, breaking down acetyl-CoA to produce ATP, NADH, and FADH2, along with 
carbon dioxide.                                                                                                                               
3. **Electron Transport Chain**: Happens in the mitochondria, using the electrons from NADH and FADH2 to generate a proton gradient, which    
drives ATP synthesis.
