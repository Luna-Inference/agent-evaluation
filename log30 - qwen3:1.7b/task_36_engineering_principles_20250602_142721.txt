Okay, I need to analyze the stability of a feedback control system with the transfer function G(s) = K/(s² + 3s + 2). Let's think about how to
approach this.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                              
First, I remember that for a system to be stable, all the poles must have negative real parts. The transfer function is a rational function,  
so the stability depends on the roots of the denominator, which is s² + 3s + 2. The denominator factors into (s + 1)(s + 2), so the poles are 
at -1 and -2. Wait, but the denominator is s² + 3s + 2, so the poles are at s = -1 and s = -2. Both are on the negative real axis, so the     
system would be stable for any K? But wait, the numerator is K, so the system's stability is determined by the denominator's poles. However,  
the denominator's poles are at -1 and -2, which are all in the left half of the complex plane. So regardless of the value of K, the system is 
stable? Or is there something else?                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                              
Wait, the system is a second-order system with poles at -1 and -2. The denominator is s² + 3s + 2, which is always positive for real s. So the
system is stable for any K. But maybe I should check using the Routh-Hurwitz criterion.                                                       
                                                                                                                                              
The Routh-Hurwitz criterion states that all poles must have negative real parts. For the denominator s² + 3s + 2, the poles are at -1 and -2. 
Both are negative, so the system is stable. However, if there were any poles with non-negative real parts, the system would be unstable. But  
in this case, all poles are in the left half-plane. So regardless of the value of K, the system is stable?                                    
                                                                                                                                              
Wait, but the transfer function is G(s) = K/(s² + 3s + 2). The denominator is s² + 3s + 2, which has roots at -1 and -2. So the system's      
stability is determined by the denominator's poles. Since they are all in the left half-plane, the system is stable. However, if the numerator
has a term that could make the system unstable, but in this case, the numerator is K, which is a constant. So the system's stability is       
determined by the denominator's poles. Therefore, the system is stable for any K.                                                             
                                                                                                                                              
So the answer should be that the system is stable for any K, as the poles are all in the left half-plane. But maybe I should confirm using the
Routh-Hurwitz criterion.                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                              
The Routh array for the denominator s² + 3s + 2 would be:                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                              
Row 1: 1 3                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                              
Row 2: 2 0                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                              
The Routh array for the denominator is:                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                              
For the denominator s² + 3s + 2, the coefficients are 1, 3, 2. The Routh array would be:                                                      
                                                                                                                                              
Row 1: 1 3                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                              
Row 2: 2 0                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                              
The first column is 1, 2. Since both are positive, all the roots are in the left half-plane. Therefore, the system is stable.                 
                                                                                                                                              
So the final answer is that the system is stable for any K.

Thought: The system's stability is determined by the poles of the transfer function. The denominator is s² + 3s + 2, which factors into (s +  
1)(s + 2), both poles at -1 and -2, which are in the left half-plane. Thus, the system is stable for any K.

Okay, the user wants to analyze the stability of a feedback control system with the transfer function G(s) = K/(s² + 3s + 2). The previous    
attempt had an error because the code tried to convert the string '3s' to a float, which caused a ValueError.                                 
                                                                                                                                              
First, I need to figure out why that happened. The denominator is 's² + 3s + 2', so when splitting into coefficients, the terms are 's²',     
'3s', and '2'. The code was splitting on '+' and then taking the coefficients from roots[1:], which would be '3s' and '2'. The problem is that
'3s' is a string with a 's' term, so trying to parse it as a float fails.                                                                     
                                                                                                                                              
So the solution is to handle the coefficients properly. Instead of splitting the string directly, maybe extract the numerical coefficients    
from the string. For example, the coefficients are 3 (for the s term) and 2 (constant term).                                                  
                                                                                                                                              
I should modify the code to parse the coefficients correctly. Maybe use regular expressions to find all the numerical coefficients in the     
denominator. The denominator is s² + 3s + 2, so the coefficients are 1 (for s²), 3 (for s), and 2 (constant). But when splitting, the code was
taking roots[1:], which would be '3s' and '2'. So the code needs to extract the numerical values from these terms.                            
                                                                                                                                              
Another approach is to use the re module to find all numbers in the string. For example, using re.findall(r'-?\d+\.?\d*|\.?\d+') to find all  
numerical coefficients. Then, convert them to floats.                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                              
So the steps would be:                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                              
1. Extract the coefficients from the denominator string.                                                                                      
2. Convert them to floats, handling any terms like '3s' or '2'.                                                                               
3. Check if all poles are in the left half-plane (i.e., real and negative).                                                                   
                                                                                                                                              
Alternatively, since the denominator is s² + 3s + 2, the poles are at -1 and -2, which are both in the left half-plane, so the system is      
stable for any K. But the user might want to confirm this with the code.                                                                      
                                                                                                                                              
The previous code tried to split the string and take coefficients, which failed because of the '3s' term. So the correct approach is to parse 
the coefficients properly. Let's adjust the code to use regular expressions to extract the coefficients.                                      
</think>                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                              
Thought: The previous code failed due to improper parsing of the denominator string. I will use regular expressions to extract coefficients   
and compute the poles correctly.
