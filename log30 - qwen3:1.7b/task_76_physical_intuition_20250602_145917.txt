Okay, the user wants to know why a figure skater spins faster when they pull their arms in. Let me think about the physics behind this.       
                                                                                                                                              
I remember that angular momentum is conserved in a closed system. When the skater pulls their arms in, their moment of inertia decreases.     
Since angular momentum (L) is equal to moment of inertia (I) times angular velocity (ω), L = Iω. If I decreases, ω must increase to keep L    
constant. So the skater spins faster because their speed increases to conserve angular momentum.                                              
                                                                                                                                              
But how to explain this in code? Wait, the user didn't ask for a calculation. They just need an explanation. So maybe I don't need to use any 
tools here. Just provide the reasoning.                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                              
Wait, the previous examples used tools like wiki, web_search, etc. But this is a physics explanation. Since there's no tool for physics       
explanations, I should just write the answer directly. The user might expect a simple explanation based on conservation of angular momentum.  
So the answer is that when the skater pulls their arms in, their moment of inertia decreases, so their angular velocity increases to keep the 
total angular momentum constant.                                                                                                              
</think>                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                              
Thought: The phenomenon is explained by the conservation of angular momentum. When the skater pulls their arms in, their moment of inertia    
decreases, so their angular velocity increases to maintain constant angular momentum. This is a classic example of rotational dynamics.       
                                                                                                                                              
Code:                                                                                                                                         
```py                                                                                                                                         
final_answer("The skater spins faster because pulling their arms in decreases their moment of inertia, causing their angular velocity to      
increase to conserve angular momentum (L = Iω).")                                                                                             
```
