<think>                                                                                                                                       
Okay, the user is asking for the chemical formula of water. Let me think about how to approach this.                                          
                                                                                                                                              
First, I know that water is a compound consisting of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. The formula is H2O. But I need to verify this.   
Since the user might want a reliable source, I should use the web search tool to check the correct formula.                                   
                                                                                                                                              
So, I'll use the web_search function with the query "chemical formula for water". The results should confirm that the formula is indeed H2O.  
Once I get the information, I can directly answer the user with the correct formula.
