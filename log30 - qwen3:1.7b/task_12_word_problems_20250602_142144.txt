<think>                                                                                                                                       
Okay, let's see. The problem is about two pipes filling a pool together in 4 hours. The first pipe takes 6 hours longer than the second one. I
need to find how long each pipe takes individually.                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                              
Hmm, so let's think. Let's denote the time taken by the second pipe as x hours. Then the first pipe would take x + 6 hours.                   
                                                                                                                                              
When they work together, their rates add up. The rate of a pipe is 1 pool per hour. So the second pipe's rate is 1/x, and the first is        
1/(x+6). Together, their rates add up to 1/4 pools per hour. So the equation would be 1/x + 1/(x+6) = 1/4.                                    
                                                                                                                                              
Now I need to solve this equation for x. Let's do that. To solve 1/x + 1/(x+6) = 1/4, find a common denominator. The common denominator is    
x(x+6). So:                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                              
(x+6 + x) / [x(x+6)] = 1/4                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                              
Which simplifies to (2x + 6) / [x(x+6)] = 1/4.                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                              
Cross-multiplying gives 4(2x + 6) = x(x + 6). Expanding both sides:                                                                           
                                                                                                                                              
8x + 24 = x² + 6x.                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                              
Bring all terms to one side:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                              
x² + 6x - 8x -24 = 0 → x² -2x -24 = 0.                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                              
Now solve the quadratic equation. Using the quadratic formula: x = [2 ± sqrt(4 + 96)] / 2 = [2 ± sqrt(100)] / 2 = [2 ± 10]/2. So the positive 
solution is (12)/2 = 6. So x is 6.                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                              
Therefore, the second pipe takes 6 hours, and the first takes 6 + 6 = 12 hours.                                                               
                                                                                                                                              
Let me check if that makes sense. If the second pipe takes 6 hours, the first takes 12. Together, their rates are 1/6 + 1/12 = 2/12 + 1/12 =  
3/12 = 1/4. Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be 6 hours for the second pipe and 12 hours for the first.
