<think>                                                                                                                                       
Okay, let's see. The problem is to find the velocity of a 2kg object just before it hits the ground after being dropped from 20 meters. Hmm,  
so I need to calculate the speed when it's falling.                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                              
First, I remember that when an object is dropped, it's under gravity, so the acceleration is due to gravity. The formula for velocity in free 
fall is v = sqrt(2gh), where g is the acceleration due to gravity and h is the height. But wait, I need to make sure about the units. The     
height is given in meters, and g is usually 9.8 m/s².                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                              
So plugging in the numbers: h is 20m, g is 9.8. Then velocity would be sqrt(2 * 9.8 * 20). Let me compute that.                               
                                                                                                                                              
Wait, but the mass of the object is 2kg. Oh, the mass isn't needed here because the velocity depends only on the height and the acceleration  
due to gravity. The mass cancels out in the formula. So I don't need to consider the mass.                                                    
                                                                                                                                              
So the calculation is sqrt(2 * 9.8 * 20). Let me compute that. 2*9.8 is 19.6, multiplied by 20 is 392. Square root of 392. Let me approximate 
that. The square of 19 is 361, 20 squared is 400. So sqrt(392) is about 19.8 m/s.                                                             
                                                                                                                                              
But I need to be precise. Let me calculate it more accurately. 19.8 squared is 392.04, which is very close to 392. So the velocity is         
approximately 19.8 m/s.                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                              
So the code should compute this. Let me write a Python code to calculate it. The formula is sqrt(2 * 9.8 * 20). Let me use the math.sqrt      
function.                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                              
Wait, but I need to make sure that the code is correct. Let me check the steps again. The formula is correct, and the calculation is          
straightforward. So the code would be:                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                              
import math                                                                                                                                   
velocity = math.sqrt(2 * 9.8 * 20)                                                                                                            
print(velocity)                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                              
But the problem says to put the final answer in a box. So the code would compute that value and then output it. The final answer should be the
numerical value.                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                              
I think that's all. The mass isn't needed here, so the code is simple. Let me write the code and then output the result.                      
</think>                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                              
Thought: I will use the formula for velocity in free fall to calculate the speed of the object. The mass is not needed since it cancels out in
the formula.
