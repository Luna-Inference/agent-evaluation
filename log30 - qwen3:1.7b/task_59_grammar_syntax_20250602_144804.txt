Okay, the user wants to know the difference between restrictive and non-restrictive relative clauses using examples. Let me think about how to
approach this.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                              
First, I need to recall the definitions. Restrictive clauses provide essential information and are usually enclosed in commas. They modify a  
specific noun, so the clause is necessary to identify the noun. For example, "The book that I bought is interesting." Here, "that I bought"   
tells us which book.                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                              
Non-restrictive clauses provide additional information and are usually set off by commas. They modify a noun but don't specify it. Like, "The 
book, which I bought, is interesting." Here, "which I bought" adds context but doesn't specify which book.                                    
                                                                                                                                              
I should create examples for both types. Maybe use sentences with both types and explain the difference. Also, mention that restrictive       
clauses are necessary, while non-restrictive are optional.                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                              
I need to make sure the examples are clear. Maybe use the sentences I mentioned earlier. Then, explain that in restrictive clauses, the comma 
is used after the relative pronoun, and in non-restrictive, a comma is before the relative pronoun. Also, note that non-restrictive clauses   
can be removed without changing the meaning, while restrictive ones can't.                                                                    
                                                                                                                                              
Wait, the user might want to see how to identify each type. So, in the code, I can generate the examples and then explain the differences. Let
me check if the tools are available. The tools are web_search, visit_webpage, final_answer, etc. But since the task is to explain, maybe I    
don't need to use any tools here. The user just needs the explanation.                                                                        
                                                                                                                                              
So, the plan is: write the explanation in the thought process, then provide the examples in code, and then the final answer. But since the    
code can't have print statements, maybe use the final_answer function to present the explanation.                                             
                                                                                                                                              
Wait, the user's task is to "Explain the difference..." so the answer should be in the final_answer. But how to structure it. Let me think.   
                                                                                                                                              
The code would generate the examples and then the explanation. But the code can't have print statements, so maybe use the final_answer to     
output the explanation. But the code needs to end with

                ```py
                final_answer("YOUR FINAL ANSWER HERE")
                ```<end_code>

Okay, let's tackle this task. The user wants to explain the difference between restrictive and non-restrictive relative clauses using         
examples.                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                              
First, I need to recall the definitions. Restrictive clauses are essential and inside the comma, like "the book that I bought."               
Non-restrictive are optional and outside the comma, like "the book, which I bought."                                                          
                                                                                                                                              
I should create clear examples for each. Maybe use sentences with both types. Then explain the differences in the clauses, the placement of   
commas, and whether they're necessary.                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                              
Since the user mentioned using tools like web_search or visit_webpage, but the task is to explain, perhaps I don't need to use them here. The 
answer should be in the final_answer function.                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                              
So, the code would generate the examples and then the explanation. But the code can't have print statements, so I need to structure it        
properly. Let me write the code with the final_answer function, explaining the differences in the thought process.                            
</think>                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                              
Thought: I will explain the difference between restrictive and non-restrictive relative clauses using examples and then provide the final     
answer.
