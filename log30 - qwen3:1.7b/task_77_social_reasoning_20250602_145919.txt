Okay, the user is asking why someone might avoid eye contact during a conversation. I need to figure out the best way to answer this. Let me  
think about the tools available.                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                              
The tools mentioned are web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer. Since the question is about reasons for avoiding eye contact, a web      
search would be helpful. Maybe I can use the web_search tool to find relevant information.                                                    
                                                                                                                                              
I should start by performing a web search for "why might someone avoid eye contact during a conversation". Then, based on the results, I can  
compile the reasons. The answer needs to be accurate and based on the search results.                                                         
                                                                                                                                              
Wait, the user's task is to answer the question, so I need to make sure the answer is derived from the search results. Let me structure the   
code to perform the search and then extract the relevant information.                                                                         
                                                                                                                                              
I'll use the web_search function with the query "why might someone avoid eye contact during a conversation". Then, I'll process the results to
gather the reasons. Finally, I'll use the final_answer tool to present the answer.

<think>                                                                                                                                       
Okay, the user is asking why someone might avoid eye contact during a conversation. The previous attempt used web_search with the query "why  
might someone avoid eye contact during a conversation" but faced an timeout error. Now, I need to figure out a different approach.            
                                                                                                                                              
First, I should check if the search query is correct. Maybe the query is too broad or specific. Let me try a more targeted approach. Perhaps  
using a different keyword or phrase. For example, "common reasons to avoid eye contact" or "social cues of avoiding eye contact".             
                                                                                                                                              
Also, considering that the previous search might have been too generic, maybe breaking down the question into parts. Like, looking for common 
reasons, cultural differences, psychological reasons, etc. Alternatively, using a different search engine or method, but since the user's tool
is limited to web_search, I need to stick to that.                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                              
Another idea: use the same search but with a different phrasing. Maybe "reasons for avoiding eye contact in conversations" or "why people     
avoid eye contact". Also, check if the search results are returning any data. If the previous attempt didn't work, maybe the issue is with the
URL or the way the search is being conducted.                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                              
Since the user's tool is web_search, perhaps trying a different query structure. Let me try a more specific query. For example, "common       
reasons to avoid eye contact in social situations" to target the reasons more precisely. Also, ensure that the code is correctly formatted and
that the search is being executed properly.                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                              
I should also check if there are any other tools available. But according to the rules, the only tools available are web_search,              
visit_webpage, and final_answer. So, I have to proceed with that.                                                                             
                                                                                                                                              
So, the next step is to adjust the search query to "common reasons to avoid eye contact in social situations" and run the code again. If that 
doesn't work, maybe try another variation. But given the constraints, this is the best approach.

Okay, the user is asking why someone might avoid eye contact during a conversation. I tried using the web_search tool with different queries  
but kept getting timeout errors. The first attempt was "why might someone avoid eye contact during a conversation," which didn't work. Then I 
tried "common reasons to avoid eye contact in social situations," which also timed out.                                                       
                                                                                                                                              
Since the search is failing, maybe I need a different approach. Maybe using a different search engine or a different query. Alternatively,    
perhaps the issue is with the way the query is structured. Let me think about possible reasons someone might avoid eye contact. Common reasons
include shyness, nervousness, lack of confidence, cultural norms, or even a desire to avoid appearing too direct.                             
                                                                                                                                              
Wait, maybe the search results are not returning because the query is too broad or specific. Let me try a more targeted query. Maybe something
like "common reasons for avoiding eye contact in social situations" to narrow it down. Alternatively, using a different search engine or      
checking if the search is blocked. But since the tool is limited, I have to stick with web_search.                                            
                                                                                                                                              
Another idea: maybe the user's internet connection is unstable, but the tool is designed to handle that. Since the previous attempts timed    
out, perhaps the next step is to try a different query. Let me try "reasons to avoid eye contact in conversations" to see if that works. If   
that fails again, maybe the problem is with the tool's ability to handle certain queries. But according to the rules, I have to keep trying   
different approaches.                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                              
So, I'll adjust the query to "reasons to avoid eye contact in conversations" and retry. If that doesn't work, maybe the answer is based on    
common knowledge, but since the user wants the tool to be used, I need to proceed with the best possible query.

<think>                                                                                                                                       
Okay, the user is asking why someone might avoid eye contact during a conversation. I tried using the web_search tool with different queries, 
but each time there was an timeout error. The previous attempts used queries like "why might someone avoid eye contact during a conversation",
"common reasons to avoid eye contact in social situations", and "reasons to avoid eye contact in conversations". All of them resulted in      
timeout errors.                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                              
Since the search is timing out, maybe the issue is with the search engine or the specific URL being used. Maybe I should try a different      
approach. Instead of using web_search, perhaps I can use the built-in knowledge base or another method. But according to the tools provided,  
the only available tools are web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer. Since web_search is failing, maybe I need to use visit_webpage to   
check the content of a specific page. However, the user hasn't provided a specific URL, so I need to find a reliable source.                  
                                                                                                                                              
Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the search queries are too broad or too specific. Let me try a more general query. For example,      
"common reasons to avoid eye contact" or "social etiquette about eye contact". Also, maybe using a different search engine or a more reliable 
URL. But since the tools are limited, I have to stick with web_search.                                                                        
                                                                                                                                              
Wait, the user might be expecting a list of reasons, so maybe the answer can be derived from common social psychology reasons. Common reasons 
include shyness, nervousness, lack of confidence, cultural differences, or even a desire to avoid seeming too direct. Another possibility is  
that the person is trying to appear more approachable or is avoiding a specific situation. Also, in some cultures, eye contact is considered  
disrespectful, so people might avoid it to show respect.                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                              
Since the search is failing, maybe the answer can be provided based on common knowledge rather than searching. However, the user's            
instructions say to use the tools available. Since the web_search is not working, perhaps the next step is to use the built-in knowledge to   
answer the question. But the tools don't include a knowledge base, so I have to rely on the search results. Since the previous attempts       
failed, maybe the answer is that the reasons include shyness, nervousness, cultural norms, or lack of confidence. I should compile these      
reasons into a final answer.

Thought: Since web_search is failing due to timeouts, I'll use common knowledge to answer based on typical reasons for avoiding eye contact.  
Common reasons include shyness, nervousness, cultural norms, or lack of confidence.
