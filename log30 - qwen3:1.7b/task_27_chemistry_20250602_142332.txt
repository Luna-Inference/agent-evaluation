Okay, the user wants an explanation of the SN2 mechanism and the stereochemistry of the product. Let me start by recalling what SN2 is. SN2   
stands for Substitution Nuclear Double displacement. It's a type of substitution reaction where the nucleophile attacks the electrophilic     
carbon atom from the opposite side of the leaving group. The reaction is bimolecular, meaning it involves two reactants.                      
                                                                                                                                              
The key points are: the nucleophile attacks the carbon atom that's bonded to the leaving group, leading to inversion of configuration. This is
called a "backside displacement." The reaction proceeds through a transition state where the nucleophile is in a partially bonded state with  
the carbon atom. The mechanism is typically observed in primary substrates because the backside attack is possible.                           
                                                                                                                                              
For stereochemistry, the product will have the opposite configuration (inversion) compared to the reactant. For example, if the substrate is a
chiral center, the product will have the opposite stereochemistry. If the substrate is not chiral, the product will be racemic, meaning equal 
amounts of both enantiomers.                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                              
Now, to predict the stereochemistry, I need to consider the starting material's configuration. If the starting material is a chiral center,   
the product will have the opposite configuration. If it's not chiral, the product will be racemic.                                            
                                                                                                                                              
I should outline the steps: explain the mechanism, mention the inversion of configuration, and discuss how the stereochemistry depends on the 
substrate's chirality. Also, note that SN2 reactions typically occur in primary substrates due to the ability of the nucleophile to approach  
the carbon from the back side.                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                              
I need to make sure the explanation is clear and covers the key aspects. Let me check if there are any exceptions or special cases, but       
generally, SN2 is about inversion and primary substrates.                                                                                     
</think>                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                              
Thought: I will explain the SN2 mechanism and predict the stereochemistry of the product by analyzing the reaction conditions and substrate
