Okay, I need to prove that the sum of two even numbers is always even. Let me think about how to approach this.                               
                                                                                                                                              
First, I remember that an even number is any integer that's divisible by 2. So, if I have two even numbers, say a and b, they can be written  
as a = 2m and b = 2n, where m and n are integers. Adding them together gives a + b = 2m + 2n = 2(m + n). Since m + n is an integer, this      
product is clearly divisible by 2, which means the sum is even.                                                                               
                                                                                                                                              
So the proof would involve expressing the even numbers in terms of 2 times integers and showing that their sum is also divisible by 2. That   
should demonstrate that the sum is always even.                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                              
I need to write a Python code snippet that formalizes this proof. Maybe using variables to represent the even numbers and then showing the    
steps. But since the user wants a proof, maybe just stating the mathematical reasoning is enough. However, the task says to "prove" it, so    
perhaps the code should demonstrate the steps.                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                              
Wait, the user might expect a code that does the mathematical proof, not just a print statement. But how to represent that in code? Maybe     
using variables and then showing the steps.                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                              
Alternatively, since the problem is purely mathematical, the code could just print the proof steps. Let me check the tools available. The     
available tools are web_search, visit_webpage, final_answer, and others. But the user wants a proof, which is more of a logical argument      
rather than a search or web page visit.                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                              
So perhaps the code can just print the mathematical reasoning. For example:                                                                   
                                                                                                                                              
print("Let a and b be two even numbers. Then a = 2m and b = 2n for some integers m and n. The sum a + b = 2m + 2n = 2(m + n). Since m + n is  
an integer, the sum is even.")                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                              
But the user might want to use the tools. However, the tools like web_search aren't applicable here. The final_answer can be used to output   
the proof.                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                              
So the code would be:                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                              
print("Let a and b be two even numbers. Then a = 2m and b = 2n for some integers m and n. The sum a + b = 2m + 2n = 2(m + n). Since m + n is  
an integer, the sum is even.")                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                              
Then, the final answer would be this printed statement. But the user's task is to "prove" it, so the code should present the proof in a way   
that shows the steps.                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                              
Alternatively, maybe using variables and then showing the calculation. But since the code is in Python, perhaps the code can compute the sum  
of two even numbers and show that it's even. But that's not the proof, it's an example.                                                       
                                                                                                                                              
Wait, the user's task is to prove it, not to compute. So the code should be a logical proof. Therefore, the code would be the mathematical    
steps as explained.

Okay, I need to prove that the sum of two even numbers is always even. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that an even number is any integer that's divisible by 2. So, if I have two even numbers, say a and b, they can be written 
as a = 2m and b = 2n, where m and n are integers. Adding them together gives a + b = 2m + 2n = 2(m + n). Since m + n is an integer, this 
product is clearly divisible by 2, which means the sum is even. 

So the proof would involve expressing the even numbers in terms of 2 times integers and showing that their sum is also divisible by 2. That 
should demonstrate that the sum is always even.

I need to write a Python code snippet that formalizes this proof. Maybe using variables to represent the even numbers and then showing the 
steps. But since the user wants a proof, maybe just stating the mathematical reasoning is enough. However, the task says to "prove" it, so 
perhaps the code should demonstrate the steps.

But the user might want to use the tools. However, the tools like web_search aren't applicable here. The final_answer can be used to output 
the proof.

So the code would be:

print("Let a and b be two even numbers. Then a = 2m and b = 2n for some integers m and n. The sum a + b = 2m + 2n = 2(m + n). Since m + n is

Okay, I need to prove that the sum of two even numbers is always even. Let's break it down.                                                   
                                                                                                                                              
First, recall that an even number can be expressed as 2 times an integer. So if I have two even numbers, say a and b, they can be written as a
= 2m and b = 2n, where m and n are integers. Adding them together gives a + b = 2m + 2n. Factor out the 2, which gives 2(m + n). Since m + n  
is an integer (because m and n are integers), the sum is 2 times an integer, which is even. Therefore, the sum of any two even numbers is     
always even.                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                              
To present this in code, I can use variables to represent the even numbers and show the steps. However, since the user wants a proof, the code
should demonstrate the mathematical reasoning. The tools available include final_answer, which can be used to output the proof.               
                                                                                                                                              
So the code would be:                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                              
Print the mathematical steps to show that the sum is even. The final answer would be the printed proof.

Thought: I will write a Python code snippet to demonstrate the mathematical proof that the sum of two even numbers is always even by          
expressing them as 2m and 2n, then showing the sum is 2(m + n), which is even.

Okay, so the user wants to prove that the sum of two even numbers is always even. The previous attempt used Python code to print the proof    
steps, but the observation shows that the code executed without any output. That's probably because the code was executed in an environment   
where the output wasn't captured, or maybe the code was not properly formatted.                                                               
                                                                                                                                              
Wait, the code printed the proof steps, but the observation says "Last output from code snippet: None". That might mean that the code was     
executed but the output wasn't displayed, or maybe the code wasn't properly formatted. Alternatively, maybe the code was run in a context

But the user's task is to prove the statement, which is a mathematical proof. The code provided in the previous attempt was supposed to       
demonstrate the steps, but maybe the code wasn't correctly formatted or the output wasn't captured. However, the code itself is correct in    
terms of logic. The proof is correct: if a and b are even, then their sum is even.                                                            
                                                                                                                                              
Since the code ran and the output was none, perhaps the user needs to ensure that the code is properly formatted and that the output is       
captured. Alternatively, maybe the code should be structured differently. For example, using variables and then showing the steps in a more   
explicit way.                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                              
Alternatively, maybe the code should be written in a way that the proof is explicitly shown, and the final answer is the conclusion. The      
previous code printed the proof steps, but maybe the output wasn't captured. However, the user's task is to prove it, so the code's output is 
sufficient even if it's not shown. The final answer would be the statement that the sum is even.                                              
                                                                                                                                              
So, the correct approach is to present the proof in the code, and the final answer would be the conclusion. The code's execution logs show the
proof steps, so even if the output was none, the code itself is correct. Therefore, the final answer is that the sum of two even numbers is   
always even.

The sum of two even numbers is always even because any even number can be expressed as $2m$ where $m$ is an integer. Adding two such numbers  
gives $2m + 2n = 2(m + n)$, which is divisible by 2. This demonstrates that the result is even.
