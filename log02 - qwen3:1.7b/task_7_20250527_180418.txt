<think>                                                                           
Okay, the user is asking for the chemical symbol of gold. I need to figure out    
what that is. From what I remember, gold is a metal used in jewelry and coins. The
symbol for gold is Au. But maybe I should verify this using a reliable source.    
                                                                                  
Wait, the tools available include web search. So I should use the web_search      
function to look up the chemical symbol for gold. Let me check the search results.
If the search returns "Au" as the symbol, then that's the answer. If not, maybe   
there's a different approach. But given that Au is a standard symbol, I think     
that's correct. Let me perform the search.                                        
</think>                                                                          
                                                                                  
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the chemical symbol for gold.     
Code:                                                                             
```py                                                                             
gold_symbol = web_search(query="chemical symbol for gold")                        
final_answer(gold_symbol)
