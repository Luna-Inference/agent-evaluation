<think>                                                                                        
Okay, the user wants a one-sentence summary of Einstein's theory of relativity. Let me think   
about what key points I need to include.                                                       
                                                                                               
The theory of relativity has two main parts: special relativity and general relativity. Special
relativity deals with objects moving at constant speeds, especially near the speed of light,   
and introduces concepts like time dilation and length contraction. General relativity extends  
this by incorporating gravity, describing it as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and  
energy.                                                                                        
                                                                                               
So, combining these, the summary should mention both theories, the key ideas, and the main     
consequence. Maybe something like: "Einstein's theory of relativity consists of two            
parts—special relativity, which describes the behavior of objects moving at constant speeds,   
and general relativity, which explains gravity as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and
energy."                                                                                       
                                                                                               
I need to check if that's accurate and concise. Yes, it covers both theories, the main         
concepts, and the key consequence. Alright, time to write the code to present this summary.    
</think>                                                                                       
                                                                                               
Thought: I will use the `wiki` tool to get a concise summary of Einstein's theory of relativity
and then present it in one sentence.                                                           
Code:                                                                                          
```py                                                                                          
theory_summary = wiki(query="theory of relativity summary")                                    
final_answer(f"Einstein's theory of relativity consists of two parts—special relativity, which 
describes the behavior of objects moving at constant speeds, and general relativity, which     
explains gravity as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy.")                    
```

<think>                                                                                        
Okay, the user asked to summarize Einstein's theory of relativity in one sentence. The previous
attempt used a function called 'wiki' which wasn't allowed. I need to find another way to get  
the information without using that tool.                                                       
                                                                                               
Since the 'wiki' function is forbidden, I should rely on existing knowledge. I remember that   
Einstein's theory of relativity has two parts: special relativity and general relativity.      
Special relativity deals with objects moving at constant speeds, and general relativity        
explains gravity as spacetime curvature.                                                       
                                                                                               
I can directly formulate the summary without using any external tools. The user wants it in one
sentence, so I'll combine the key points into a concise statement. Let me check if there's any 
other information needed, but the task seems straightforward. The final answer should be a     
single sentence explaining both theories.

Thought: I will use my knowledge to provide a concise summary of Einstein's theory of          
relativity without relying on external tools. The theory consists of two parts: special        
relativity (constant-speed motion) and general relativity (spacetime curvature due to          
mass/energy).

spacetime curvature.
