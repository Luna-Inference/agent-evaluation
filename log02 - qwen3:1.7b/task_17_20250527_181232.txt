<think>                                                                           
Okay, the user is asking for the tallest mountain in the world. I need to find    
that information. Let me think about the tools I have.                            
                                                                                  
The available tools are web search and visiting web pages. So I should use the    
web_search function. The query should be straightforward: "tallest mountain in the
world".                                                                           
                                                                                  
I'll call the web_search function with that query. Then, I'll process the results 
to extract the answer. Since the results might be multiple entries, I'll check the
first one and extract the mountain name and height.                               
                                                                                  
Wait, the user wants the answer in one go. So after getting the search results, I 
need to parse them. The first result might mention the Everest with its height.   
Let me make sure the search returns the correct information.                      
                                                                                  
Once I have the height, I can present it as the final answer. Let me write the    
code to perform the search and then extract the relevant information.             
</think>                                                                          
                                                                                  
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the tallest mountain in the world 
and then extract the answer from the results.                                     
Code:                                                                             
```py                                                                             
tallest_mountain_search = web_search(query="tallest mountain in the world")       
print("Search results:", tallest_mountain_search)                                 
final_answer("The tallest mountain in the world is Mount Everest, which has an    
elevation of 8848 meters.")                                                       
```
