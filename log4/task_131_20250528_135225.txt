Okay, the user is asking who wrote "Crime and Punishment." I need to figure out the answer. I remember that Crime and Punishment is 
a famous novel by Fyodor Dostoevsky. But maybe I should verify this using the tools provided.                                       
                                                                                                                                    
First, I'll use the web search tool to check the author of the book. The query would be "Crime and Punishment author." Let me       
perform the search. If the result confirms it, I can be sure. If not, maybe there's a different author, but I think Dostoevsky is   
the correct answer here. Since the tools are available, I'll proceed with the search.
