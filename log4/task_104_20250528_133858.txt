Okay, the user is asking for the largest lake in Africa. Let me think about how to approach this.                                   
                                                                                                                                    
First, I need to find the information about lakes in Africa. The tools available include web search and visiting webpages. So maybe 
I should use the web_search function to look up the largest lake.                                                                   
                                                                                                                                    
Wait, the user mentioned using the tools provided. The tools are web_search and visit_webpage, as well as final_answer. So I can    
perform a web search for "largest lake in Africa" and get the results. Then, I can parse the results to find the answer.            
                                                                                                                                    
But how to handle the search results? The observation would show the top results. For example, the largest lake is Lake Victoria,   
but I need to confirm that. However, the exact answer might be in the search results. So I'll perform the search, then check the    
first result to find the answer.                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                    
Alternatively, maybe the web_search function returns the answer directly. Let me structure the code: call web_search with the query,
then process the result to extract the largest lake.                                                                                
                                                                                                                                    
I should make sure to use the correct parameters. The query is "largest lake in Africa". The code would be something like:          
                                                                                                                                    
web_search("largest lake in Africa")                                                                                                
Then, in the observation, the result would be the top answer. Finally, use final_answer to present the answer.                      
                                                                                                                                    
But I need to check if the web_search returns the answer directly. If not, maybe I need to parse the HTML content. However, the     
tools don't include HTML parsing, so perhaps the web_search returns the answer as a string. Assuming that the first result is the   
answer, I can take that string and use final_answer.                                                                                
                                                                                                                                    
So the steps are: perform the search, get the result, extract the answer, and return it.

Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the largest lake in Africa and then extract the answer from the results.

largest_lake = web_search(query="largest lake in Africa")                                                                           
final_answer(largest_lake)
