<think>                                                                                                                             
Okay, the user is asking who the author of 'To Kill a Mockingbird' is. I need to figure out how to find this information. Let me    
think about the tools available.                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                    
The available tools are web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer. The web_search function can be used to look up the book's      
author. Since the user is asking for a straightforward answer, I should use web_search with the query "author of To Kill a          
Mockingbird".                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                    
I should call web_search with the exact query to get the top results. Then, I can extract the author's name from the search results.
If the search returns the information, I can print it and use the final_answer tool to provide the answer.                          
                                                                                                                                    
Wait, the user might want the answer directly. So, I'll perform the search, get the result, and then output the author's name. Let  
me write the code for that.                                                                                                         
</think>                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                    
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the author of "To Kill a Mockingbird" and then return the final answer.             
Code:
