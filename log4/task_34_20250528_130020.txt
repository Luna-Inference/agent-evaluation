<think>                                                                                     
Okay, the user is asking for the chemical formula of water. I need to figure out the correct
formula. From what I remember, water is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.  
So the formula should be H2O. But wait, maybe I should verify this.                         
                                                                                            
Hmm, the tools available include web search and wiki. Maybe I can use the web_search        
function to check the current knowledge. Let me try that. The query would be "chemical      
formula for water". Let me run the code to get the result.                                  
</think>                                                                                    
                                                                                            
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the chemical formula for water.             
Code:                                                                                       
```py                                                                                       
water_formula = web_search(query="chemical formula for water")                              
final_answer(water_formula)
