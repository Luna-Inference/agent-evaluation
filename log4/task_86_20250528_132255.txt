<think>                                                                                                                             
Okay, the user is asking who wrote "The Odyssey". I need to find the answer using the tools provided. Let me think about the steps. 
                                                                                                                                    
First, I should check if there's a tool available to look up information about literary works. The tools mentioned include web      
search, which might be useful here. The user might want the answer directly, so using the web search tool with the query "Who wrote 
The Odyssey?" makes sense.                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                    
I'll start by performing a web search for the answer. The tool 'web_search' takes a query string. So I'll call web_search with the  
query "Who wrote The Odyssey?".                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                    
Once I get the results, I can parse them to find the author. The results might list the author as Homer. Since the user wants the   
answer, I'll then use the final_answer tool to present the result.                                                                  
</think>                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                    
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the author of "The Odyssey" and then return the final answer.                       
Code:
