Okay, the user is asking about the Roman god of war. I need to figure out the answer. From what I remember, in Roman mythology,     
Jupiter is the king of the gods, but there's a god specifically associated with war. Let me think... Oh right, Mars is the Roman god
of war. He's often depicted with a spear and a helmet. But I should verify this to be sure.                                         
                                                                                                                                    
Wait, the user might want a direct answer. Since I can use the web search tool, I should check a reliable source. Let me use the    
web_search function with the query "Roman god of war". That should give the correct information. Once I get the result, I can       
extract the answer and present it.                                                                                                  
</think>
