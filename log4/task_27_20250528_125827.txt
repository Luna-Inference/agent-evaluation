Okay, the user is asking for the largest planet in our solar system. Let me think about how 
to approach this.                                                                           
                                                                                            
First, I remember that the solar system has eight planets, and Jupiter is the largest. But  
maybe I should verify this using the available tools. The tools provided include web search 
and wiki. So I can use the web_search function to check recent information.                 
                                                                                            
I'll start by performing a web search for "largest planet in our solar system". The result  
should give me the answer. Then, I can use the final_answer tool to present the result.

Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the largest planet in our solar system.
