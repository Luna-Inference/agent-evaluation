<think>                                                                                                                             
Okay, the user is asking who discovered electricity. I need to figure out how to find the answer. Let's think about the tools       
available. The tools mentioned are web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer. So maybe I should use web_search to look up the     
history of electricity discovery.                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                    
First, I should perform a web search for "who discovered electricity". The result might give me the answer. But I need to make sure 
the search is accurate. Maybe the answer is a well-known figure like Benjamin Franklin. But I should check the sources.             
                                                                                                                                    
Wait, the user might expect the answer to be Benjamin Franklin, but I should verify through the web search. Let me write a code     
snippet to do a web search with the query "who discovered electricity". Then, based on the results, I can extract the answer and    
present it.                                                                                                                         
</think>                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                    
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the answer to "who discovered electricity" and then extract the result.             
Code:                                                                                                                               
```py
