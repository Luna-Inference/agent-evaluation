<think>                                                                                                                             
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Greece. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have.           
                                                                                                                                    
Hmm, the available tools are web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer. Since the question is straightforward, maybe a web search 
would work. I can use the web_search function with the query "capital of Greece". Let me check if there's a need to visit a specific
webpage. But the user didn't mention any particular source, so a general search should suffice.                                     
                                                                                                                                    
I should call web_search with the query. Then, once I get the results, I can extract the capital from the top result. But wait, the 
tools don't have a function to parse the results. So maybe the web_search returns the top result as a string. I can then use the    
final_answer to present the answer based on that.                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                    
Alternatively, maybe the web_search returns the capital directly. Let me proceed by performing the search and then output the       
answer.                                                                                                                             
</think>                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                    
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the capital of Greece and then return the result.
