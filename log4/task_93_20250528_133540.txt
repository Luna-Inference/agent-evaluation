<think>                                                                                                                             
Okay, the user is asking who the author of 'Moby Dick' is. I need to figure out how to find that information. Let me think about the
tools available.                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                    
First, I remember that the user has access to a few tools: web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer. The web_search function can 
be used to look up information. Since the question is straightforward, I can use web_search with the query "author of Moby Dick".   
                                                                                                                                    
I should check if there's any need to visit a specific webpage. But since the user didn't mention any particular source, a general  
web search should suffice. The search results will probably give the answer directly. Once I get the result from the search, I can  
then use the final_answer tool to present the answer.                                                                               
                                                                                                                                    
Wait, the tools are notional, so I can just call web_search with the right parameters. The query should be "author of Moby Dick".   
Let me write the code accordingly.                                                                                                  
</think>                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                    
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the author of "Moby Dick".
