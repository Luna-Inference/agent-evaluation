<think>                                                                                                                             
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Sweden. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have.           
                                                                                                                                    
First, I can use the web search tool to look up the capital of Sweden. The web_search function would be appropriate here. The query 
should be "capital of Sweden". Let me check if there's any need for translation, but the question is in English, so no translation  
needed.                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                    
I'll call the web_search function with the query. Then, once I get the results, I can extract the capital from the top result. The  
results might be in a format like a list of sentences. So I'll look for the sentence that mentions the capital. Once I have that, I 
can use the final_answer tool to present the answer.                                                                                
                                                                                                                                    
Wait, the user might expect a direct answer. Let me make sure the search returns the correct information. If the search returns     
something like "Stockholm is the capital of Sweden.", then I can take that and put it in the final answer.                          
                                                                                                                                    
So the steps are: perform a web search for "capital of Sweden", extract the relevant sentence, and then return the answer.
