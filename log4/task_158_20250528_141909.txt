<think>                                                                                                                             
Okay, the user is asking who discovered the structure of DNA. I need to figure out the answer. Let me think.                        
                                                                                                                                    
I remember from biology class that DNA's structure was discovered by James Watson and Francis Crick. But maybe I should verify this.
Let me check the tools available. There's a wiki tool, so I can use that to look up the answer. Also, web search might help confirm.
                                                                                                                                    
First, I'll use the wiki tool with the query "who discovered the structure of DNA". That should give me the correct information. If 
the wiki returns the answer, I can then present it. If not, maybe a web search would help. But since the user allowed using the     
wiki, let's start with that.                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                    
So the code would be something like:                                                                                                
pope_age_wiki = wiki(query="who discovered the structure of DNA")                                                                   
print("Answer: ", pope_age_wiki)                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                    
Wait, but the user's tools might have different functions. The wiki function returns a string, and I need to process that. If the   
answer is straightforward, I can just print it. If there's a need for further steps, like a web search, but since the task is       
simple, maybe the wiki already has the answer. Let me proceed with the wiki call.                                                   
</think>                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                    
Thought: I will use the `wiki` tool to find the answer about who discovered the structure of DNA.                                   
Code:

dna_structure_discoverer = wiki(query="who discovered the structure of DNA")

```

Okay, the user is asking who discovered the structure of DNA. I tried using the wiki tool earlier, but there was an error because   
the tool wasn't allowed. Let me think of another approach.                                                                          
                                                                                                                                    
Since the wiki tool isn't available, maybe I can use a web search instead. The web_search function can be used to look up the       
answer. Let me check the parameters. The query should be "who discovered the structure of DNA".                                     
                                                                                                                                    
I'll modify the code to use web_search instead of wiki. The code will be:                                                           
web_search_result = web_search(query="who discovered the structure of DNA")                                                         
final_answer(f"The structure of DNA was discovered by {web_search_result}")                                                         
                                                                                                                                    
This should retrieve the answer from a web search. I need to make sure the code is correct and doesn't have any errors. Let me      
execute this.
