Okay, the user is asking for the main ingredient in couscous. I need to figure out how to find this information. Couscous is a      
staple in North African cuisine, so maybe I can search for the ingredients list of couscous.                                        
                                                                                                                                    
First, I should use the web_search tool to look up the ingredients. The query should be something like "main ingredient in          
couscous". Let me check the tools available. The web_search function takes a query string and returns the top results.              
                                                                                                                                    
I'll run the search with the query "main ingredient in couscous". Then, I need to parse the results to find the answer. The results 
might be in a format like a list of sentences or a paragraph. The main ingredient is likely mentioned in the first few results.     
                                                                                                                                    
Once I get the search results, I can extract the relevant information. If the search returns a list, I'll look for the part that    
mentions the main ingredient. The answer should be something like "semolina of wheat" or "wheat flour".                             
                                                                                                                                    
I should make sure to use the correct tool and parameters. The web_search function is the right one here. Let me execute the code to
perform the search and then process the results.

Okay, so the user asked, "What is the main ingredient in couscous?" Let me think about how to approach this.                        
                                                                                                                                    
First, I remember that couscous is a staple in North African cuisine. From the web search results, I saw mentions of semolina flour 
and durum wheat. The search results clearly state that couscous is made from semolina of durum wheat. The other ingredients like    
water are mentioned but the main one is semolina.                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                    
Wait, the observation from the code showed that the search results confirmed that the main ingredient is semolina flour. The answer 
should be semolina of durum wheat. I need to make sure there's no confusion with other ingredients. The answer is straightforward   
based on the search results.

The main ingredient in couscous is semolina flour, which is made from durum wheat. This flour is moistened with water and processed 
into the characteristic granules used in couscous dishes.                                                                           
                                                                                                                                    
Final Answer: semolina of durum wheat

tool with the right query and then print the result. Let me check the tools again. The web_search function takes a query string, so
