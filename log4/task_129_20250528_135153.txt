Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Belgium. Let me think about how to approach this.                                       
                                                                                                                                    
First, I know that the capital of Belgium is Brussels. But maybe I should verify this using a reliable source. Since the tools      
available include web search and wiki, I can use those to confirm.                                                                  
                                                                                                                                    
I'll start by using the web_search tool with the query "capital of Belgium" to get the latest information. Then, I can check the    
results to make sure. If the search returns the correct information, I can directly answer the user. If not, maybe I need to search 
again or use another method. But given that Brussels is a well-known fact, the web search should return it. Let me proceed with the 
code.                                                                                                                               
</think>                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                    
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the capital of Belgium.
