Okay, the user is asking about the main language spoken in Egypt. Let me think about how to approach this.                          
                                                                                                                                    
First, I need to find out what languages are spoken there. The main ones are Arabic and Egyptian Arabic. But maybe there's more to  
it. I should check if there are other languages like Turkish or Hindi, but I remember that Egypt is a predominantly Arabic country. 
                                                                                                                                    
Wait, the user might want the most common language. So, I should search for recent data. Let me use the web search tool to find the 
current main language. Let me check the search results.                                                                             
                                                                                                                                    
I'll perform a web search for "main language in Egypt" to get the latest information. Then, based on the results, I can determine   
the answer.                                                                                                                         
</think>                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                    
Thought: I will use the web search tool to find the main language spoken in Egypt and then return the final answer based on the     
search results.
