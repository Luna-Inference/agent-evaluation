Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Serbia. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have.           
                                                                                                                                    
First, I can use the web search tool to look up the capital of Serbia. The web_search function would be appropriate here. The query 
should be "capital of Serbia". Let me check if there's any need for additional steps.                                               
                                                                                                                                    
Since the user wants the answer, I'll perform a web search for the capital of Serbia. Once I get the results, I can extract the     
capital from the top search result. Then, I'll use the final_answer tool to provide the answer.                                     
                                                                                                                                    
I should make sure the search is accurate. If the web search returns the correct information, like Belgrade, then that's the answer.
If not, maybe I need to try another search, but for now, let's proceed with the first search.
