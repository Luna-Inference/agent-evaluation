<think>                                                                                     
Okay, the user wants a synonym for 'happy'. Let me think about the tools I have. The        
available tools are web_search, visit_webpage, final_answer, and others. Since they're      
asking for a synonym, I need to find a word that means 'happy' in the same context.         
                                                                                            
First, I should use the web_search tool with the query "synonym for happy". That should     
return a list of synonyms. Then, I can extract the first result and use final_answer to     
present it. Let me check if there are any other tools needed, but since the user didn't     
specify a particular context, just a general synonym, the web_search should suffice. I'll   
make sure to format the code correctly, using the web_search function with the right        
parameters. The code will search for synonyms, print the result, and then return the answer.

Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find a synonym for 'happy' and then return the
