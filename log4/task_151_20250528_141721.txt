<think>                                                                                                                             
Okay, the user is asking for the main ingredient in goulash. I need to figure out what the answer is. Goulash is a traditional dish 
from Hungary, right? I remember that it's usually made with beef or veal, some vegetables, and a tomato-based sauce. But maybe      
there's a specific main ingredient they're looking for.                                                                             
                                                                                                                                    
Hmm, I should check if there's a reliable source or a way to confirm. Since I can use web search, maybe I can perform a search to   
find the main ingredients. Let me use the web_search tool with the query "main ingredient in goulash". That should give me the top  
results.                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                    
Once I get the results, I can look for the part that mentions the main ingredient. The answer might be something like beef or pork. 
But I need to make sure I'm getting the correct information. If the search returns multiple sources, I should check the most        
reputable ones.                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                    
Wait, the user might expect the answer to be beef, but maybe there's a variation. However, the main ingredient is typically beef. So
after searching, if the results mention beef as the main ingredient, that's the answer. If not, maybe it's pork. But I should rely  
on the search results to confirm.                                                                                                   
</think>

ingredients like onions, paprika, and tomatoes are also important, but the primary ingredient is the beef. The American version     
might use ground turkey or pork, but the traditional version is beef. The answer should be beef, but I need to confirm from the     
search results. The search results from AllRecipes and The Pioneer Woman mention ground beef as the main ingredient. The other
