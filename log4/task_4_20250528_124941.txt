<think>                                                                                     
Okay, the user wants a summary of Einstein's theory of relativity in one sentence. Let me   
think about how to approach this.                                                           
                                                                                            
First, I need to recall the key points of the theory. The theory of relativity has two      
parts: special and general. Special relativity deals with objects moving at constant speeds,
especially near the speed of light, and introduces concepts like time dilation and length   
contraction. General relativity extends this by including gravity, describing it as the     
curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy.                                           
                                                                                            
So, combining these, the theory of relativity states that the laws of physics are the same  
for all non-accelerating observers, and that the speed of light is constant in all reference
frames. General relativity explains gravity as the curvature of spacetime, which is         
influenced by mass and energy.                                                              
                                                                                            
I need to phrase this in one sentence. Maybe something like: "The theory of relativity      
posits that the laws of physics are invariant in all inertial frames and that gravity is the
curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy."                                          
                                                                                            
Wait, let me check if that's accurate. Special relativity's key points are time dilation,   
length contraction, and the invariance of the speed of light. General relativity's key      
points are spacetime curvature and the equivalence principle. So combining these, the       
summary should mention both special and general relativity, or at least the main ideas.     
                                                                                            
Alternatively, maybe "Einstein's theory of relativity combines special relativity, which    
deals with objects moving at constant speeds, and general relativity, which describes       
gravity as the curvature of spacetime." But the user wants it in one sentence, so perhaps a 
more concise version.                                                                       
                                                                                            
Another approach: "The theory of relativity describes the behavior of objects in motion and 
the nature of gravity, with special relativity focusing on inertial frames and general      
relativity explaining gravitational effects through spacetime curvature."                   
                                                                                            
Hmm, maybe the first version is better. Let me make sure it's accurate and concise.         
</think>                                                                                    
                                                                                            
Thought: I will summarize the theory of relativity by combining its key principles from both
special and general relativity.

summary = "Einstein's theory of relativity combines special relativity, which deals with    
objects moving at constant speeds, and general relativity, which describes gravity as the   
curvature of spacetime."
