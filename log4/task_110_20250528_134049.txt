Okay, the user is asking who the author of 'The Divine Comedy' is. I need to figure out how to find this information. Let me think  
about the tools I have.                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                    
First, I remember that the user has access to a search function. The previous examples used web searches, so maybe I can use that   
here. The task is straightforward: find the author of The Divine Comedy.                                                            
                                                                                                                                    
I should use the web_search tool with the query "author of The Divine Comedy". Let me check if there's any specific context needed. 
The user might expect a simple answer, but perhaps I need to verify the source.                                                     
                                                                                                                                    
Wait, The Divine Comedy is a famous work by Dante Alighieri. But maybe the search tool can confirm this. Let me perform the search  
and get the result. If the search returns the correct information, I can extract the author's name.                                 
                                                                                                                                    
I'll write a code snippet to perform the web search and then output the result. If the search returns the author's name, I can use  
that as the final answer. If not, maybe I need to try another approach, but given the tools available, this should work.
