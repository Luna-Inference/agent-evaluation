<think>                                                                                     
Okay, the user is asking who wrote the book "1984". I need to figure out how to find this   
information. Let me think about the tools available.                                        
                                                                                            
First, I remember that in the previous examples, the assistant used tools like web_search   
and wiki. So maybe I can use web_search here. The query would be "who wrote 1984". Let me   
check if there's a direct tool for that.                                                    
                                                                                            
Wait, the user's tools include web_search and visit_webpage. So I can use web_search with   
the query "who wrote 1984". The function returns the top results. Then, I can parse the     
result to find the author.                                                                  
                                                                                            
Alternatively, maybe the wiki tool could work, but I'm not sure if there's a specific wiki  
page for this. Since the user's previous examples used web_search, perhaps that's the way to
go.                                                                                         
                                                                                            
So the plan is: use web_search with the query "who wrote 1984", get the results, and then   
extract the author from the first result. Then, return that as the final answer.            
</think>                                                                                    
                                                                                            
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the author of "1984" and then extract the   
information from the results.
