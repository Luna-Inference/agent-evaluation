<think>                                                                                                                             
Okay, the user is asking about the process of cell division. I need to figure out what the correct term is. From what I remember,   
cell division has two main types: mitosis and meiosis. Mitosis is for growing and repairing cells, while meiosis is for producing   
gametes like eggs and sperm. But the question is general, so maybe they want the common term.                                       
                                                                                                                                    
Wait, the question is "What is the process of cell division called?" So the answer is typically "cell division" itself, but maybe   
they want the specific terms. However, in most cases, the answer is simply "cell division," but sometimes it's referred to as       
mitosis or meiosis. But since the question is general, the answer should be "cell division."                                        
                                                                                                                                    
But let me make sure. Maybe the user expects the two processes. But the question is phrased as "the process," so it's probably      
referring to the general term. So the answer is "cell division." But I should verify using a tool if possible. However, the         
available tools are web_search and wiki. Let me use web_search to confirm.                                                          
                                                                                                                                    
So the code would be to perform a web search for "process of cell division called" and get the top result. Then extract the answer  
from there. But since the user might expect a direct answer, maybe the tool will return the correct term. Let me proceed.

Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the general term for the process of cell division.                                  
Code:

[Cell division - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_division)
Cell division is the process by which a parent cell divides into two daughter cells. [1] Cell division usually occurs as part of a 
larger cell cycle in which the cell grows and replicates its chromosome (s) before dividing.

[Cell Division - Mitosis and Meiosis | Ask A Biologist](https://askabiologist.asu.edu/cell-division)
A single cell divides to make two cells and these two cells then divide to make four cells, and so on. We call this process "cell 
division" and "cell reproduction," because new cells are formed when old cells divide.

[Cell Division - Definition, Stages and Types | Biology Dictionary](https://biologydictionary.net/cell-division/)
Cell division is the process cells go through to divide. There are several types of cell division, depending upon what type of 
organism is dividing. Organisms have evolved over time to have different and more complex forms of cell division.

[The Stages of Mitosis and Cell Division - ThoughtCo](https://www.thoughtco.com/stages-of-mitosis-373534)
Mitosis is the phase of the cell cycle in which chromosomes in the nucleus are evenly divided between two cells. When the cell 
division process is complete, two daughter cells with identical genetic material are produced. Understanding the steps of mitosis is
crucial in comprehending how organisms grow, develop, and repair tissues. It plays a fundamental role in various biological 
processes ...

[How do cells divide?: MedlinePlus Genetics](https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/understanding/howgeneswork/cellsdivide/)
Meiosis is the type of cell division that creates egg and sperm cells. Mitosis is a fundamental process for life. During mitosis, a 
cell duplicates all of its contents, including its chromosomes, and splits to form two identical daughter cells. Because this 
process is so critical, the steps of mitosis are carefully controlled by certain genes.

[Cell Division - Definition, Types, Mitosis, Meiosis, Cell 
cycle](https://biologynotesonline.com/cell-division-definition-types-mitosis-meiosis-cell-cycle/)
What is Cell Division? Cell division is a fundamental process through which organisms generate new cells. This process is crucial 
for growth, development, repair, and reproduction. Different types of cell division occur depending on the organism involved. 
Prokaryotes, such as bacteria, divide through a relatively simple process called binary fission, while eukaryotic organisms, which 
include ...

[Cell Division: Mitosis & Meiosis, Different Phases of Cell Cycle](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cell-division/)
Cell division is the process by which a parent cell divides into two daughter cells. It occurs through two distinct processes, 
mitosis, and meiosis, each having its role in the life cycles of organisms. Mitosis is the division of a cell that produces two 
identical daughter cells, essential for growth and tissue maintenance.

[Cell Division - Definition, Types, Steps, and Diagram](https://www.sciencefacts.net/cell-division.html)
Cell division is a process in which a parent cell divides to form two or more daughter cells. It is usually a part of the cell cycle
that helps to repair or replace dead or damaged cells in all living organisms. In higher animals, it also helps organisms to grow 
and survive. Astonishingly, nearly two trillion cells divide the human body daily!

[Types of Cell Division - BYJU'S](https://byjus.com/biology/cell-division/)
Types of Cell Division There are two distinct types of cell division out of which the first one is vegetative division, wherein each
daughter cell duplicates the parent cell called mitosis. The second one is meiosis, which divides into four haploid daughter cells. 
Mitosis: The process cells use to make exact replicas of themselves. Mitosis is observed in almost all the body's cells ...

[Cell division - Definition and Examples - Biology Online](https://www.biologyonline.com/dictionary/cell-division)
Cell division is a biological process by which a parent cell duplicates its cell contents and divides to give rise to two or more 
daughter cells. It is an irreplaceable biological process in all living organisms; being the "means of growth, repair, and 
reproduction in multicellular organisms" and "the sole source of reproduction in unicellular organisms".
