Okay, the user is asking who painted 'Starry Night'. I need to figure out the answer. Let me
think about the tools I have. The available tools are web_search, visit_webpage, and        
final_answer.                                                                               
                                                                                            
First, I should use web_search to look up the information. The query should be "Who painted 
Starry Night?". Since the user might want the most accurate answer, I'll perform a web      
search to get the top results.                                                              
                                                                                            
I'll call the web_search function with the query. Then, I'll check the results to find the  
artist. The results might include links to art databases or museums. Once I get the answer, 
I can use the final_answer tool to provide the answer to the user.                          
                                                                                            
Wait, the tools don't include a direct image search, but the web_search can handle          
text-based queries. So, the steps are: perform a web search for the question, extract the   
artist's name from the results, and then return that name.                                  
</think>                                                                                    
                                                                                            
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the artist of "Starry Night" and then return
the final answer.
