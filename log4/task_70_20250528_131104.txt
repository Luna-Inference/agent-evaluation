<think>                                                                                     
Okay, the user is asking for the tallest building in the world. I need to figure out how to 
get that information. Let me think about the tools available.                               
                                                                                            
Hmm, the previous examples used web searches and tools like wiki and search. In this case,  
the user might need a web search to find the latest data. The tools provided include        
web_search and visit_webpage. So I should use the web_search function with the query        
"tallest building world".                                                                   
                                                                                            
Wait, the user might want the most recent data, so I should make sure the search is         
up-to-date. The previous example used a search with a specific query, so I'll follow that   
approach. Let me structure the code to perform the search and then retrieve the result.     
                                                                                            
I need to call the web_search function with the query "tallest building world". Then, the   
result will be the top answer. Once I have that, I can present it as the final answer. Let  
me check if there are any other steps needed, like verifying the source or handling multiple
results. But since the user just wants the tallest building, the first result should        
suffice.                                                                                    
                                                                                            
So the code will be: call web_search with the query, then print the result and return it as 
the final answer.                                                                           
</think>                                                                                    
                                                                                            
Thought: I will use the `web_search` tool to find the tallest building in the world and then
return the result.                                                                          
Code:                                                                                       
```py                                                                                       
tallest_building = web_search(query="tallest building world")                               
final_answer(tallest_building)                                                              
```
