Okay, the user is asking who wrote 'Les Misérables'. I need to find the author of this classic novel. Let me think about the tools I
have.                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                    
First, I can use the web search tool to look up the book's author. The query should be straightforward. I'll perform a web search   
for "Les Misérables author" to get the answer. Once I get the result, I can extract the author's name from the top search result.   
                                                                                                                                    
Wait, the tools available are web_search and visit_webpage. So I'll call web_search with the query "Les Misérables author". The     
result will be the top result, which should mention the author. Then I can parse that result to get the name.                       
                                                                                                                                    
I should check if there are any other tools needed. Since the user didn't specify any particular method, just a simple search should
suffice. Let me execute the code to perform the search and then retrieve the answer.
