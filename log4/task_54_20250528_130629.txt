<think>                                                                                     
Okay, the user is asking for a famous composer from the Classical period. Let me think about
the key figures from that time.                                                             
                                                                                            
The Classical period in music history is generally considered to be from the 1750s to the   
1820s. During this time, composers like Mozart, Beethoven, and Haydn are prominent. Mozart  
is often cited as a key figure, but maybe the user wants someone more well-known. Beethoven 
is also a major name, though he's sometimes considered the transition from Classical to     
Romantic. Haydn is definitely a classic example.                                            
                                                                                            
Wait, the question is just to name a famous composer, not necessarily the most iconic. So   
maybe Haydn is the best answer here. But I should verify if there's a more common choice.   
Alternatively, Mozart is another obvious answer. Let me check if there's any specific       
context the user might be referring to. Since the task is straightforward, providing either 
would be acceptable. But to be safe, maybe go with Haydn as he's often listed as a classic  
Classical composer.                                                                         
</think>                                                                                    
                                                                                            
Thought: I will use the tool `wiki` to find a famous composer from the Classical period.    
Code:                                                                                       
```py                                                                                       
classical_composer = wiki(query="famous composer from the Classical period")                
final_answer(classical_composer)                                                            
```

Okay, the user asked for a famous composer from the Classical period. My first attempt used 
the wiki tool, but it didn't work because the tool wasn't allowed. I need to find another   
way without using external tools.                                                           
                                                                                            
Since the wiki tool isn't available, I should rely on my knowledge. The Classical period    
includes composers like Mozart, Beethoven, and Haydn. Mozart is often highlighted as a key  
figure. Alternatively, Haydn is a classic example. Since the question is straightforward,   
picking one would be best. I'll go with Haydn as he's a well-known Classical composer.

Thought: I will provide the answer based on my knowledge without using external tools.

```py
