<think>                                                                                                                             
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Romania. Let me think about how to approach this.                                       
                                                                                                                                    
First, I know that the capital of Romania is Bucharest. But since the user might want a reliable source, maybe I should verify it   
using a tool. The available tools include web search and wiki. Let me use the web search function to confirm.                       
                                                                                                                                    
So I'll perform a web search for "capital of Romania" to get the accurate information. Then, I can retrieve the result and present  
it as the final answer.                                                                                                             
</think>                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                    
Thought: I will use the web search tool to find the capital of Romania.
