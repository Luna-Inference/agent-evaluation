<think>                                                                                     
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of South Korea. I need to find that information.   
Let me think about the tools I have available.                                              
                                                                                            
First, I can use the web search tool to look up the capital. The web_search function takes a
query, so I'll set the query to "capital of South Korea". Then, I can retrieve the results  
and extract the capital from the first result.                                              
                                                                                            
Wait, the tools mentioned include web_search and visit_webpage. So I'll perform a web search
with the query. The observation will give me the top result. From there, I can parse the    
result to find the capital.                                                                 
                                                                                            
Alternatively, maybe the wiki tool can be used, but since the user didn't specify a         
particular source, web_search is more appropriate. Let me proceed with that.                
                                                                                            
I'll write code to perform the web search, then parse the first result to get the capital.  
If the result is a string like "The capital of South Korea is Seoul.", I can take the part  
after "is" and trim any extra text.                                                         
                                                                                            
Once I have the capital, I can use the final_answer function to return it.                  
</think>                                                                                    
                                                                                            
Thought: I will use the web search tool to find the capital of South Korea and then extract 
the answer from the first result.
