<think>                                                                                                                             
Okay, the user is asking who the founder of Microsoft is. I need to figure out how to find this information. Let me think about the 
tools I have available.                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                    
The available tools are web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer. So I can use web_search to look up the answer. The question is 
straightforward, so I'll perform a web search for "founder of Microsoft".                                                           
                                                                                                                                    
I should make sure to use the correct parameters. The web_search function takes a query string. So I'll call web_search with the    
query "founder of Microsoft". Then, I'll process the results to get the answer.                                                     
                                                                                                                                    
Once I get the search results, I can extract the founder's name from the top result. The results might be in a format like a list of
sentences. I'll check the first result and look for the part that mentions the founder.                                             
                                                                                                                                    
If the search returns the correct information, I can then use the final_answer tool to present the answer. If there's no result, I  
might need to adjust the search query, but since the question is straightforward, it's likely that the search will find the answer.

Okay, the user is asking about the founder of Microsoft. Earlier, I tried using the wiki tool but got an error because 'wiki' isn't 
allowed. The allowed tools are web_search and visit_webpage. So I need to adjust my approach.                                       
                                                                                                                                    
I should use web_search directly instead of trying to use wiki. Let me try searching for "founder of Microsoft" using the web_search
function. Then, extract the answer from the search results. Since the web_search returns the top results, I'll check the first      
result to find the founder's name. Finally, use the final_answer tool to present the answer.
