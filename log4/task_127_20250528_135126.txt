<think>                                                                                                                             
Okay, the user is asking for the main ingredient in risotto. I need to figure out how to find this information. Let's think about   
the tools available. The user mentioned using Python functions, so maybe I can use web search or some kind of data retrieval.       
                                                                                                                                    
First, I should check if there's a tool to search for recipes or food ingredients. The available tools are web_search and           
visit_webpage. So I can use web_search with the query "main ingredient in risotto".                                                 
                                                                                                                                    
Wait, the user's previous examples used the web_search function. So I'll proceed by performing a web search for that exact question.
The answer will be the top result from the search. Then, I can extract the main ingredient from that result.                        
                                                                                                                                    
I need to make sure the code is correct. The code should call web_search with the query, then process the result. Since the         
observation will show the search results, I can parse the first result to find the main ingredient.                                 
                                                                                                                                    
Let me write the code: call web_search with "main ingredient in risotto", then check the first result. If the result contains the   
answer, I can print it and finally answer the user.                                                                                 
</think>                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                    
Thought: I will use the `web_search` tool to find the main ingredient in risotto and then extract the answer from the search        
results.
