Okay, the user is asking who invented the telephone. I need to find the answer using the    
tools available. Let me think about the steps.                                              
                                                                                            
First, I should use the web search tool to look up the invention of the telephone. The tools
include web_search and visit_webpage. Since the question is straightforward, a web search   
should give the answer. I'll perform a search for "who invented the telephone" and get the  
top results. Then, I can extract the information from the search results.                   
                                                                                            
Wait, the user might expect the answer to be Alexander Graham Bell. But I need to confirm   
via the search. So I'll use the web_search function with the query "who invented the        
telephone" and then process the results to find the inventor.                               
                                                                                            
I should check the first few results to see if they mention Bell. If the search returns     
multiple sources, I'll pick the most relevant one. Once I have the answer, I can use the    
final_answer tool to present it.                                                            
</think>                                                                                    
                                                                                            
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the inventor of the telephone and then      
extract the answer from the results.
