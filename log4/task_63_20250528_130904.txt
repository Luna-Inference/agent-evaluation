<think>                                                                                     
Okay, the user is asking for a continent that lies entirely in the Southern Hemisphere. Let 
me think about the continents and their locations.                                          
                                                                                            
I remember that the Southern Hemisphere includes all the continents south of the equator.   
The main continents are Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Europe, and Australia.  
Wait, but Australia is considered part of Oceania, which is a region, not a continent. So   
the continents are Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Europe, and Australia. But   
the question is about a continent entirely in the Southern Hemisphere.                      
                                                                                            
Looking at the continents, South America is almost entirely in the Southern Hemisphere. Most
of it is in the Southern Hemisphere, with a small part in the Northern Hemisphere.          
Similarly, Africa is mostly in the Southern Hemisphere, but there's a small part in the     
Northern. Europe is mostly in the Northern Hemisphere. Asia is mostly in the Northern       
Hemisphere, with a small part in the Southern.                                              
                                                                                            
So the continent that lies entirely in the Southern Hemisphere would be South America. But  
wait, I need to confirm. Let me check if there's any part of South America that's in the    
Northern Hemisphere. The southern part of South America is in the Southern Hemisphere, but  
the northern part is in the Northern Hemisphere. So maybe the answer is South America.      
                                                                                            
Alternatively, maybe the question is looking for a continent that is almost entirely in the 
Southern Hemisphere. But the exact answer might be South America. I think that's the one. So
the answer should be South America.                                                         
</think>                                                                                    
                                                                                            
Thought: I need to identify a continent entirely in the Southern Hemisphere. The continents 
are divided by the equator, with South America mostly in the Southern Hemisphere.
