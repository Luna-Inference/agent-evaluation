Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Estonia. Let me think about how to approach this.                                       
                                                                                                                                    
First, I know that the capital of a country is the city that serves as the political center. Estonia is a country in Europe, so its 
capital should be a well-known city. From my previous knowledge, I recall that Tallinn is the capital of Estonia. But to be sure, I 
should verify this using a reliable source.                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                    
Since the tools available include web search and visiting webpages, I can use the web_search function to look up the capital of     
Estonia. The query should be straightforward: "capital of Estonia".                                                                 
                                                                                                                                    
I'll perform a web search to find the information. Once I get the results, I can extract the capital from the top search results. If
the search returns the correct information, I can then present that as the answer.                                                  
                                                                                                                                    
Another way to confirm is to use the wiki tool, but since the user hasn't specified any particular tool, I'll stick with web_search.
Let's proceed with that.                                                                                                            
</think>                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                    
Thought: I will use the web search tool to find the capital of Estonia.
