Okay, the user is asking for the tallest animal in the world. I need to figure out how to find that using the tools provided. Let me
think about the tools available.                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                    
The tools are web_search and visit_webpage, which can be used to look up information. Also, there's the final_answer function to    
present the result. Since the question is about a well-known fact, maybe a web search would directly give the answer.               
                                                                                                                                    
I should start by performing a web search for "tallest animal in the world". The search results might include information from      
reputable sources like Wikipedia or scientific articles. Once I get the results, I can extract the answer.                          
                                                                                                                                    
Wait, the user's previous examples used the web_search function, so I'll use that. Let me structure the code to call web_search with
the query "tallest animal in the world". Then, the result will be the top answer, which I can print and then use final_answer to    
present the answer.                                                                                                                 
</think>                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                    
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the tallest animal in the world and then return the final answer.                   
Code:
