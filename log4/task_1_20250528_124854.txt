<think>                                                                                     
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of France. I need to find that out. Let me think   
about the tools I have.                                                                     
                                                                                            
Hmm, the available tools are web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer. Since the question
is straightforward, maybe a web search would work. I can use the web_search function with   
the query "capital of France".                                                              
                                                                                            
Wait, but the user might expect an exact answer. Let me check if there's a need to visit a  
specific webpage. But the problem isn't specific enough to require visiting a particular    
site. So a simple web search should suffice.                                                
                                                                                            
I'll call web_search with the query "capital of France" to get the top results. Then, I can 
extract the capital from the first result and return it using final_answer.                 
</think>                                                                                    
                                                                                            
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the capital of France and then return the   
result.

```py                                                                                       
capital_of_france = web_search(query="capital of France")
