<think>                                                                                                                             
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Russia. I need to find that out. Let me think about the tools I have.                   
                                                                                                                                    
Hmm, the available tools are web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer. Since the question is straightforward, maybe a web search 
would work. I can use the web_search function with the query "capital of Russia".                                                   
                                                                                                                                    
Wait, but the user might want the most recent information. Let me check the results. If the web search returns the capital, then I  
can directly use that in the final answer. If not, maybe I need to visit a specific webpage. But since the question is simple, the  
first search should suffice.                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                    
So I'll perform the web search, get the result, and then output the capital. Let me write the code for that.                        
</think>                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                    
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the capital of Russia.
