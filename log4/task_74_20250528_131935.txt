Okay, the user is asking for the largest island in the world. I need to figure out how to find that using the tools available.      
                                                                                                                                    
First, I remember that the tools include web search and visiting webpages. So maybe I can use the web_search function to look up    
information about the largest islands. The user might expect the answer to be something like Greenland, but I need to confirm.      
                                                                                                                                    
I should start by performing a web search for "largest island in the world". The results might list various islands, and I need to  
determine which one is the largest. The tools don't have a specific function for this, so I'll have to use the web_search to get the
top results.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                    
Once I have the search results, I can analyze them to find the island with the largest area. The answer might be Greenland, but I   
need to make sure. The web_search could return information like "Greenland is the largest island in the world, covering about 2.1   
million square kilometers."                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                    
I should then use the final_answer function to present the result. But wait, the user's question is straightforward, so maybe the   
web_search will directly give the answer. Let me structure the code to perform the search and then output the answer.               
</think>
