<think>                                                                                                                             
Okay, the user is asking for the main ingredient in pad thai. I need to figure out how to find this information. Let's think about  
the tools available. The user mentioned using Python functions, so maybe I can use web search or a database query.                  
                                                                                                                                    
First, I should check if there's a tool to search for food recipes or ingredients. The available tools are web_search and           
visit_webpage. So I'll use web_search with the query "main ingredient in pad thai".                                                 
                                                                                                                                    
Wait, the user's previous examples used web_search and visited webpages. So I'll perform a web search for the main ingredient of pad
thai. The result might be a list of ingredients, and I need to extract the main one.                                                
                                                                                                                                    
I'll write a code snippet that does a web search for "main ingredient in pad thai" and then parse the results. But since the tools  
don't have a way to parse the web results, I'll just print the first result. Then, based on the observation, I can determine the    
main ingredient.                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                    
Alternatively, maybe the web_search returns the answer directly. Let's proceed with the code.                                       
</think>                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                    
Thought: I will use the `web_search` tool to find the main ingredient of pad thai and then extract the answer from the search       
results.                                                                                                                            
Code:
