<think>                                                                                                                             
Okay, the user is asking who discovered the theory of evolution. I need to figure out how to find the answer. Let me think about the
tools available.                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                    
Hmm, the tools mentioned are web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer. So maybe I should use web_search to look up the answer.   
The question is straightforward, but I need to make sure I get the correct information.                                             
                                                                                                                                    
Wait, the theory of evolution was developed by many people. Darwin is the main figure, but maybe there were others. However, the    
question is asking who discovered it, so the answer is usually Darwin. But I should verify this through a search.                   
                                                                                                                                    
I'll use the web_search tool with the query "who discovered the theory of evolution". Then, I can check the results to confirm. If  
the search returns that Darwin is the main contributor, then that's the answer. If there are other contributors, I need to mention  
them. But the standard answer is Darwin.                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                    
So the code would be to perform the web search and then extract the answer from the results. Then, use final_answer to present the  
answer.                                                                                                                             
</think>                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                    
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the answer to the question "Who discovered the theory of evolution" and then extract
the result.
