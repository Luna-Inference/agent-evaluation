Okay, the user is asking who painted 'The Scream'. I need to figure out the answer. Let me think about the tools I have. The        
available tools are web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer.                                                                    
                                                                                                                                    
First, I should use web_search to look up information about 'The Scream' painting. The query should be straightforward. Maybe       
something like "Who painted The Scream?".                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                    
Wait, I remember that 'The Scream' is a well-known artwork by Edvard Munch. But to be sure, I should verify this through a web      
search. Let me call the web_search function with the query "Who painted The Scream?".                                               
                                                                                                                                    
Once I get the results, I can check the top results to confirm the artist. If the search returns the correct information, I can then
use the final_answer tool to present the answer. If there's ambiguity, maybe the search results will clarify. But based on my       
knowledge, the answer is Edvard Munch. However, to ensure accuracy, I should perform the search first.

Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the artist of 'The Scream'.
