<think>                                                                                                                             
Okay, the user is asking for the chemical formula of table salt. Let me think. Table salt is commonly known as sodium chloride. So  
the formula should be NaCl. But wait, I should verify this to make sure. Maybe I can use the web search tool to check the correct   
formula.                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                    
So the steps would be: first, perform a web search to find the correct chemical formula for sodium chloride. Then, extract the      
information from the search results and confirm the formula. Since the user wants the answer, once I find the correct formula, I can
present it as the final answer.                                                                                                     
</think>                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                    
Thought: I will use the web search tool to find the chemical formula for table salt.
