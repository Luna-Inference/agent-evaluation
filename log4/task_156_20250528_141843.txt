Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Croatia. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have.          
                                                                                                                                    
First, I can use the web search tool to look up the capital of Croatia. The web_search function can be used here. The query would be
"capital of Croatia". Let me check if there's a specific tool for this. The available tools include web_search, which is a          
duckduckgo search. So I'll perform a web search with that query.                                                                    
                                                                                                                                    
Once I get the results, I need to extract the capital from the top search results. The observation will show the search results, and
I can parse them to find the answer. Since the user expects a direct answer, I'll process the results and return the capital.
