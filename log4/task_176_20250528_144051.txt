Okay, the user is asking who discovered the planet Neptune. Let me think about how to approach this.                                
                                                                                                                                    
First, I need to find the historical information about Neptune's discovery. Since I can use web search tools, I should perform a    
search to get the relevant information. The tools available include web_search and visit_webpage. Let me use the web_search function
with the query "who discovered Neptune".                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                    
Once I get the results, I need to extract the answer. The observation will provide the top results. Looking at the results, the     
first one mentions that Neptune was discovered by Johann Gottfried Galle on September 23, 1846. That's the key information. I should
confirm the date and the person involved. Since the user just wants the name, I can directly use that information.                  
                                                                                                                                    
I should make sure there's no confusion with other planets. For example, Neptune was discovered after many other planets, but the   
main discoverer is Galle. The answer should be Johann Gottfried Galle.
