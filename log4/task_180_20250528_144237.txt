Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Malta. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have available.  
The tools include web search, visiting webpages, and final answer. Since Malta is a small country, its capital is likely well-known,
but maybe I should verify using a web search to be sure.                                                                            
                                                                                                                                    
First, I'll use the web_search tool with the query "capital of Malta". That should return the top results. Then, I can parse the    
first result to extract the capital. If the search returns a direct answer, I can use that. If not, I might need to visit the       
webpage and read the content. But since the user expects a straightforward answer, maybe the web search will provide it directly.   
                                                                                                                                    
Once I have the capital, I'll use the final_answer tool to present it. Let me write the code to perform the web search and then     
process the result.
