Okay, the user wants me to explain quantum entanglement simply. Let me think about how to   
approach this.                                                                              
                                                                                            
First, I need to recall what quantum entanglement is. From what I remember, entanglement is 
a phenomenon where particles become connected, so the state of one affects the other        
instantly, no matter the distance. But I should make sure to explain it in a way that's easy
to understand, maybe using an analogy.                                                      
                                                                                            
I should start by mentioning that entangled particles, like photons, are linked. When       
they're entangled, measuring one's property (like spin or polarization) instantly determines
the other's property. But this seems counterintuitive because it's faster than light, which 
Einstein called "spooky action at a distance." However, I need to clarify that this doesn't 
violate relativity because no information is actually transmitted faster than light.        
                                                                                            
Maybe use a simple example, like two coins that are flipped, and their outcomes are linked. 
But I should avoid technical terms. Also, mention that entanglement is a key part of quantum
mechanics and has applications like quantum computing and cryptography.                     
                                                                                            
I should check if there's any common misconception to address. For instance, some people    
think it's about telepathy, but that's not correct. The key point is the instantaneous      
correlation between particles, not actual communication.                                    
                                                                                            
Now, I need to structure the explanation step by step. Start with the basic concept, explain
the entanglement, the measurement effect, and the implications. Keep it concise but         
thorough.                                                                                   
                                                                                            
I should also make sure the explanation is not too technical. Avoid jargon unless necessary.
Maybe use a metaphor, like two dice that are always opposite each other, but that might not 
be accurate. Alternatively, compare it to a pair of linked dice that always show opposite   
sides when rolled.                                                                          
                                                                                            
Wait, the user wants it simple, so maybe use a more abstract analogy. Like two coins that   
are always linked, so if one is heads, the other is tails, regardless of where they are. But
that's not exactly accurate, since quantum entanglement is about the state being correlated,
not necessarily opposite.                                                                   
                                                                                            
Alternatively, think of it as two particles that are connected in a way that their          
properties are linked, even if they're far apart. So measuring one's property instantly     
determines the other's, but this doesn't allow for faster-than-light communication.         
                                                                                            
I need to make sure the explanation is correct and clear. Let me outline the key points:    
                                                                                            
1. Entangled particles are linked, so their properties are correlated.                      
2. Measuring one's property instantly determines the other's, even if they're far apart.    
3. This seems to contradict relativity, but no information is actually transmitted faster   
than light.                                                                                 
4. Applications in quantum technology.                                                      
                                                                                            
Now, write the code to generate this explanation. But since the user didn't ask for code,   
maybe just provide the explanation directly. Wait, the task is to explain it simply, so the 
answer is the explanation. But the assistant is supposed to use code blobs. However, in the 
previous examples, the assistant used code to perform searches or calls to tools. But here, 
the task is to explain, which doesn't require code. But according to the rules, the         
assistant must use code blobs. Wait, the user's task is to "Explain quantum entanglement    
simply." The assistant is supposed to generate the explanation, but the rules say to use    
code blobs. However, in the previous examples, when the task was to answer a question with  
code, the assistant used code. But here, the task is to explain, which is a text-based      
answer. However, the assistant must use code blobs. But how?                                
                                                                                            
Wait, the assistant is supposed to use the tools provided. The tools are web_search,        
visit_webpage, final_answer. But the user's task is to explain, which is a text answer. So  
perhaps the assistant can use the final_answer tool to output the explanation. But the      
assistant's previous examples show that when the task is to answer a question, the assistant
uses code. But here, the task is to explain, so the assistant can just provide the          
explanation in the final_answer.                                                            
                                                                                            
But according to the rules, the assistant must use code blobs. However, in this case, the   
explanation is straightforward text. So maybe the assistant can just write the explanation  
in the final_answer. But the assistant's code must be in Python. So perhaps the assistant   
can use the final_answer tool to output the explanation.                                    
                                                                                            
So the code would be:                                                                       
                                                                                            
final_answer("Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where two particles become linked in such

properties of the entangled particles are found to be correlated, even if they are separated

applications in quantum computing and cryptography.")                                       
                                                                                            
But the assistant needs to make sure that the explanation is correct. Let me check the key  
points again.                                                                               
                                                                                            
Yes, the explanation covers the essence: entangled particles are linked, measurement affects
both, faster-than-light communication is not possible, and applications. So the code would  
be as above, and the final answer would be that explanation.
