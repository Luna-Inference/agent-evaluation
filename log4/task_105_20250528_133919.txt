Okay, the user is asking about the Greek goddess of wisdom. Let me think. From what I remember, in Greek mythology, the goddess of  
wisdom is Athena. She's known for her intellect and strategic thinking. But I should verify this.                                   
                                                                                                                                    
I need to check if there's any other goddess associated with wisdom. Sometimes there are multiple deities, but Athena is the most   
prominent. Maybe I should use a tool to confirm. The available tools are web_search and visit_webpage. Let me use web_search with   
the query "Greek goddess of wisdom" to get accurate information.                                                                    
                                                                                                                                    
Wait, the user might expect a direct answer, but I should make sure. The search should return the correct information. Once I get   
the result, I can extract the answer and present it.                                                                                
</think>                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                    
Thought: I will use the web search tool to find the Greek goddess of wisdom.
