<think>                                                                                                                             
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Bulgaria. I need to find that out. Let me think about the tools I have.                 
                                                                                                                                    
Hmm, the available tools are web search, visiting webpages, and final answer. So maybe I can use the web search tool to look up the 
capital of Bulgaria. The question is straightforward.                                                                               
                                                                                                                                    
I should construct a query for the web search. The query would be something like "capital of Bulgaria". Let me check if there's a   
specific tool for this. The web_search function takes a query string. So I'll call web_search with "capital of Bulgaria".           
                                                                                                                                    
Once I get the results, I need to parse them to find the capital. The observation from the search might return a list of results.   
The first result might mention the capital. For example, if the search returns something like "The capital of Bulgaria is Sofia."   
Then I can extract that information.                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                    
After getting the answer from the search, I can use the final_answer tool to present the result. So the steps are: perform the web  
search, retrieve the capital from the results, and then output it.                                                                  
</think>                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                    
Thought: I will use the web search tool to find the capital of Bulgaria.
