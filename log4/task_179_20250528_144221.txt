Okay, the user is asking who wrote "The Picture of Dorian Gray." Let me think about how to approach this.                           
                                                                                                                                    
First, I need to find the author of this famous novel. The title reminds me of Oscar Wilde's work. But maybe I should verify this.  
The novel is known for its themes of moral decay and the protagonist's obsession with his appearance. Oscar Wilde is the most       
recognized author of this book. However, to be thorough, I should check if there's any other possible author or if there's any      
confusion with another work.                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                    
Since the user is asking for the author, I can use a web search to confirm. The tool 'web_search' can be used with the query "Who   
wrote The Picture of Dorian Gray?" The search should return the correct author. Alternatively, if the web search returns the same   
result as my initial knowledge, I can confirm it. But since the tools are available, I should proceed with the search to ensure     
accuracy.                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                    
I need to structure the code to perform the web search and then extract the answer. The code will use the 'web_search' function with
the appropriate query. Once the search results are obtained, the answer can be printed or processed further. Since the user expects 
a direct answer, the final answer will be the result of the web search.                                                             
</think>                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                    
Thought: I will use the `web_search` tool to find the author of "The Picture of Dorian Gray."
