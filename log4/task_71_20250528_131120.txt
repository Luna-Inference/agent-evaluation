Okay, the user is asking who discovered gravity. I need to figure out the answer. Let me    
think.                                                                                      
                                                                                            
First, I remember that Isaac Newton is often credited with discovering gravity. But wait,   
there's also Galileo Galilei. Galileo did experiments with falling objects and came up with 
the concept of acceleration due to gravity. But did he discover it? Hmm, maybe Newton built 
on Galileo's work. So the question is, who is considered the discoverer?                    
                                                                                            
I should check the tools available. The tools here are web_search and visit_webpage. So I   
can use web_search to look up the answer. Let me use the web_search function with the query 
"Who discovered gravity?".                                                                  
                                                                                            
Wait, the user might expect Newton, but maybe the answer is Galileo. Let me make sure. The  
web search will give the correct information. Let me perform the search.

Okay, so the user asked, "Who discovered gravity?" Based on the web search results, I need  
to determine the correct answer. The search results mention Isaac Newton and Galileo        
Galilei. Galileo did experiments with falling objects, but did he discover gravity? Newton  
built on Galileo's work. However, the search results also note that Newton is commonly      
credited with discovering gravity. The answer might be Newton, but I should check the       
sources.                                                                                    
                                                                                            
Looking at the observation, the search results from Britannica and other sources say Isaac  
Newton discovered the law of gravity. However, Galileo's experiments with falling objects   
laid the groundwork. But the question is about who "discovered" gravity. In historical      
context, Newton is the primary figure credited with the law of universal gravitation. The   
answer is likely Isaac Newton.

The question of who discovered gravity is historically complex. While Galileo Galilei       
formulated the concept of gravitational acceleration through experiments with falling       
objects, Isaac Newton later developed the law of universal gravitation in his *Principia    
Mathematica*. Newton's work unified the concepts of terrestrial and celestial mechanics,

Final Answer: Isaac Newton

Okay, the user is asking who discovered gravity. From the web search results, it's clear that Isaac Newton is the primary figure    
credited with discovering the law of universal gravitation. However, Galileo Galilei's experiments with falling objects laid the    
groundwork. But the question is about who "discovered" gravity. In historical context, Newton's work in the *Principia Mathematica* 
unified terrestrial and celestial mechanics, making him the key figure. The search results also mention that Newton built on        
Galileo's work. The answer is likely Isaac Newton, but I need to confirm based on the search results.

Okay, the user is asking who discovered gravity. From the web search results, it's clear that Isaac Newton is the primary figure    
credited with discovering the law of universal gravitation. However, Galileo Galilei's experiments with falling objects laid the    
groundwork. But the question is about who "discovered" gravity. In historical context, Newton's work in the *Principia Mathematica* 
unified terrestrial and celestial mechanics, making him the key figure. The search results also mention that Newton built on        
Galileo's work. The answer is likely Isaac Newton, but I need to confirm based on the search results.

The code snippet was invalid due to the regex pattern issue. After correcting that, the code retrieved the search results. The 
observation shows that the search results highlight Newton's role. Therefore, the final answer is Isaac Newton.

Final Answer: Isaac Newton
                It seems like you're trying to return the final answer, you can do it as follows:
                Code:
                ```py
                final_answer("YOUR FINAL ANSWER HERE")
                ```<end_code>

Okay, the user is asking who discovered gravity. From the web search results, it's clear that Isaac Newton is the primary figure credited with discovering the law of universal gravitation. However, Galileo Galilei's experiments with falling objects laid the groundwork. But the question is about who "discovered" gravity. In historical context, Newton's work in the *Principia Mathematica* unified terrestrial and celestial mechanics, making him the key figure. The search results also mention that Newton built on Galileo's work. The answer is likely Isaac Newton, but I need to confirm based on the search results.

The code snippet was invalid due to the regex pattern issue. After correcting that, the code retrieved the search results. The observation shows that the search results highlight Newton's role. Therefore, the final answer is Isaac Newton.

The discovery of gravity is often attributed to **Isaac Newton**. He formulated the **Law of Universal Gravitation** in his 1687 work, *Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica*, which explained that every mass in the universe attracts every other mass with a force proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. This work unified terrestrial and celestial mechanics, making Newton the key figure in the scientific revolution.

While Galileo Galilei's experiments with falling objects laid the groundwork, Newton's mathematical formulation and theoretical unification of gravity and motion established it as his major contribution. 

**Answer:** Isaac Newton.
