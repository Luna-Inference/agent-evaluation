<think>                                                                                                                             
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of India. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools available. The user
mentioned using web search and visiting webpages, so maybe I can use the web_search function.                                       
                                                                                                                                    
First, I should perform a web search for the capital of India. The query would be something like "capital of India". Then, I can    
retrieve the results and extract the answer. Since the web_search function returns the top results, I'll check the first result to  
find the capital.                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                    
Wait, the tools are web_search and visit_webpage. So I'll call web_search with the query "capital of India". Then, look at the      
returned results. The first result might be a page stating that New Delhi is the capital. I'll need to parse that information.      
                                                                                                                                    
Alternatively, maybe the web_search returns a list of URLs, and I can visit the first URL to get the exact answer. But according to 
the rules, I can't use visit_webpage unless I've already used web_search. Wait, the user's previous examples show that sometimes you
use web_search and then visit_webpage. But in this case, maybe the web_search already returns the answer directly.                  
                                                                                                                                    
Let me check the possible outputs. If the web_search returns a string like "The capital of India is New Delhi.", then I can just    
take that as the answer. Otherwise, I need to visit the webpage. But since the user's example for the population of Guangzhou used  
web_search and then printed the result, maybe in this case, the web_search already gives the answer.                                
                                                                                                                                    
So the code would be: call web_search with "capital of India", then extract the answer from the result. But how to extract it? The  
web_search returns a string, so I can split it or find the part that mentions the capital.                                          
                                                                                                                                    
Alternatively, maybe the web_search returns a list of URLs, and the first URL is the one with the answer. Then, I can visit that URL
using visit_webpage and read the content. But the user's previous example for the population of Guangzhou used web_search and then  
printed the result. So perhaps in this case, the web_search returns the answer directly.                                            
                                                                                                                                    
So the code would be:                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                    
web_search("capital of India")                                                                                                      
Then, the answer is the first result. But how to get that in code? The web_search returns a string, so I can split it or find the   
part that says "capital of India is...".                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                    
Alternatively, maybe the web_search returns a list of results, and the first one is the answer. So I can take the first element and 
extract the capital.                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                    
But since the user's tools don't have a way to parse the search results, perhaps the web_search returns the answer directly. So the 
code would be:                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                    
answer = web_search("capital of India")                                                                                             
final_answer(answer)                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                    
But I need to make sure that the web_search returns the correct answer. If the search returns "New Delhi is the capital of India.", 
then the answer is New Delhi. Otherwise, maybe the search returns a different URL, but the user's previous examples show that       
sometimes you need to visit the webpage. However, in this case, since the user is asking for a straightforward question, the        
web_search should return the answer directly.                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                    
So the final code would be to call web_search with the query and then return the answer.                                            
</think>                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                    
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the capital of India and then return the answer.                                    
Code:
