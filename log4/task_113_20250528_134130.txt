<think>                                                                                                                             
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Denmark. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have. The      
available tools are web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer. Since the question is straightforward, I can use the web_search    
function with the query "capital of Denmark".                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                    
Wait, the user might want the most recent information. So I should perform a web search to get the current capital. The capital of  
Denmark is Copenhagen, but I should confirm via the search. Let me check the tools again. The web_search function takes a query     
string, so I'll use that.                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                    
I'll write a code snippet that uses web_search with the query "capital of Denmark". Then, once I get the results, I can extract the 
capital from the first result and return it using final_answer.

Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the capital of Denmark.
