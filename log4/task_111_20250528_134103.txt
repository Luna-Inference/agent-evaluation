<think>                                                                                                                             
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Norway. I need to find that information. Let me think about the tools I have available. 
The tools include web search, visiting webpages, and final answer. Since the capital of Norway is a well-known fact, maybe I can use
the web search tool to look it up.                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                    
First, I should perform a web search for "capital of Norway". The web_search function can be used here. The query would be          
straightforward. Once I get the results, I can extract the capital from the top search results.                                     
                                                                                                                                    
Wait, the user might expect a direct answer. But since the tools don't have a specific country capital database, I need to rely on  
the web search. Let me check the tools again. The web_search function returns the top results, so I'll parse that.                  
                                                                                                                                    
I'll write a code snippet that uses web_search with the query "capital of Norway". Then, I'll print the result to see what's        
returned. If the result contains the capital, I can final_answer it. If not, maybe I need to try another approach, but for now,     
let's proceed with the first step.                                                                                                  
</think>
