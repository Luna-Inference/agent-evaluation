Okay, the user is asking about the main ingredient in borscht. I need to figure out how to find this information. Borscht is a      
traditional Jewish soup with a tangy flavor, often made with various vegetables and spices. The main ingredients might include      
cabbage, onions, peppers, and other vegetables. But I need to confirm this.                                                         
                                                                                                                                    
First, I should search for reliable sources that list the ingredients of borscht. Since the user might expect a specific answer, but
I don't have a direct tool for that. However, the available tools include web search and visiting webpages. So I can use the        
web_search function to look up the ingredients.                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                    
I'll start by performing a web search for "main ingredient in borscht". The results might vary by region or recipe. The answer could
be cabbage, but I need to check. Also, considering that borscht can have different variations, but the most common one is cabbage.  
                                                                                                                                    
I'll write a code snippet to perform the search and then extract the main ingredient from the results. If the search returns a list 
of ingredients, I can parse it to find the main one. If the search result is a single sentence, I can take that as the answer.      
                                                                                                                                    
Another approach is to check the most common recipes or culinary sources. For example, the Wikipedia page or cooking blogs might    
list the ingredients. Since the user's question is straightforward, the code should efficiently retrieve the information.
