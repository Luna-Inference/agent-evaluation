<think>                                                                                     
Okay, the user is asking who the author of 'The Hobbit' is. I need to figure out how to find
this information. Let me think about the tools available.                                   
                                                                                            
First, I remember that the user has access to a search tool, which can be used to look up   
information. The tools mentioned include web_search and visit_webpage, which might help     
retrieve the answer. Since the question is straightforward, I can use the web_search        
function with the query "author of The Hobbit".                                             
                                                                                            
I should check if there's any need to use other tools, like a dictionary or a specific      
database. But given the available tools, web_search seems appropriate. Let me structure the 
code to perform the search and then extract the answer.                                     
                                                                                            
Wait, the user's previous examples used the web_search function directly. So the code would 
be something like:                                                                          
                                                                                            
web_search(query="author of The Hobbit")                                                    
                                                                                            
Then, the result would be the answer. Since the answer is likely to be in the search        
results, I can print it and then use final_answer to present the result. But I need to make 
sure the code is correct and follows the rules.                                             
                                                                                            
Also, I need to avoid any unnecessary steps. The task is simple, so just perform the search 
and return the answer. Let me write the code accordingly.                                   
</think>                                                                                    
                                                                                            
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the author of "The Hobbit".                 
Code:                                                                                       
```py                                                                                       
hobbit_author = web_search(query="author of The Hobbit")                                    
final_answer(hobbit_author)                                                                 
```
