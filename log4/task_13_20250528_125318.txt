<think>                                                                                     
Okay, the user is asking for the largest mammal. I need to figure out how to find that      
information. Let me think about the tools I have available.                                 
                                                                                            
First, I remember that there's a tool called `wiki` which can search for information. Maybe 
I can use that to look up the largest mammal. But wait, the user might want the most recent 
data, so I should check both Wikipedia and a web search to make sure.                       
                                                                                            
I should start by using the `wiki` tool with the query "largest mammal". That should give me
some basic information. If the result is outdated, I can then use a web search to get the   
most up-to-date answer. But according to the rules, I can't chain tool calls in the same    
code block. So I need to handle it step by step.                                            
                                                                                            
Wait, the user's task is to answer the question, so I need to make sure I get the correct   
answer. Let me first call the `wiki` function with the query. If the wiki result is not     
accurate, I can then use the `web_search` tool. But since the user's example shows that     
sometimes you need to visit multiple pages, maybe I should check both sources.              
                                                                                            
But according to the rules, I can't have multiple tool calls in the same code block. So I   
need to do them one at a time. Let me first use the `wiki` tool to get the initial answer.  
If that doesn't give the correct info, then proceed with the web search. However, the user  
might expect the answer to be from a reliable source, so maybe the wiki result is           
sufficient.                                                                                 
                                                                                            
Alternatively, maybe the `web_search` tool can provide a more accurate answer. Let me try   
the `wiki` first. If the wiki returns "Elephant" as the largest mammal, then that's the     
answer. But if it's outdated, then the web search would be needed. But since the user's     
example shows that sometimes you need to visit multiple pages, perhaps I should first check 
the wiki, then the web search.                                                              
                                                                                            
Wait, the user's task is to answer the question, so I need to make sure the answer is       
correct. Let me proceed step by step. First, use the `wiki` tool with the query "largest    
mammal". Then, if the result is not accurate, use the `web_search` tool. But according to   
the rules, I can't chain the tool calls in the same code block. So I need to do them in     
separate steps.                                                                             
                                                                                            
So the plan is: first, use the `wiki` tool to get the answer. If that's not sufficient, then
use the `web_search` tool. But since the user's example shows that sometimes you need to    
visit multiple pages, maybe the answer is already in the wiki result. Let me check the wiki 
first.                                                                                      
</think>                                                                                    
                                                                                            
Thought: I will use the `wiki` tool to find the largest mammal and then confirm with a web  
search if needed.

largest_mammal_wiki = wiki(query="largest mammal")                                          
print("Largest mammal as per wikipedia:", largest_mammal_wiki)

<think>                                                                                     
Okay, the user is asking for the largest mammal. The previous attempt tried using the `wiki`
and `web_search` tools but encountered an error because those functions weren't allowed. The
error message says that 'wiki' is not among the explicitly allowed tools. So, I need to find
another way to get the answer without using those tools.                                    
                                                                                            
Since the allowed tools are limited to the ones listed in the rules, and the user's example 
uses `wiki` and `web_search`, but those are not allowed here, I have to think of another    
method. Maybe the answer is known and can be retrieved through a different approach, like a 
direct lookup or a known fact.                                                              
                                                                                            
I remember that the largest mammal is the blue whale. But how to confirm this without using 
the allowed tools? The user might expect the answer to be derived from a known fact. Since  
the previous attempts failed due to tool restrictions, perhaps the answer is straightforward
and can be provided directly.                                                               
                                                                                            
Alternatively, maybe the user's system allows using the `final_answer` tool directly. The   
last example showed that `final_answer` can be used to return the result. So, I can simply  
use the `final_answer` function to output the answer.                                       
                                                                                            
Therefore, the correct approach is to use the `final_answer` tool with the known answer that
the largest mammal is the blue whale.                                                       
</think>                                                                                    
                                                                                            
Thought: Since the allowed tools are limited and the `wiki` and `web_search` functions are  
not available, I will directly use the `final_answer` tool with the known fact that the     
largest mammal is the blue whale.                                                           
Code:                                                                                       
```py                                                                                       
final_answer("The largest mammal is the blue whale.")                                       
```
