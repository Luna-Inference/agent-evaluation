Okay, the user is asking for the chemical symbol of zinc. I need to figure out what that is. I remember that zinc is a metal, and   
its symbol is Zn. But maybe I should verify this using a tool to be sure. Let me check.                                             
                                                                                                                                    
First, I'll use the web search tool to look up the chemical symbol for zinc. The web search should return the correct symbol. Then, 
I can confirm it with the answer. Since the user wants the exact answer, I'll make sure to get the correct information from the     
search results.
