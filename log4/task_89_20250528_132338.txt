<think>                                                                                                                             
Okay, the user is asking about the process by which water changes from liquid to gas. I need to explain that process. From what I   
remember, when water is heated, it undergoes vaporization. The liquid state turns into gas when it's heated, and this is called     
evaporation. But maybe I should confirm this with some information.                                                                 
                                                                                                                                    
Wait, the tools available include web search and wiki. So maybe I should use the web_search function to find the exact process. Let 
me think. The user probably wants a clear explanation, so using the search tool to get the correct term, like 'phase change from    
liquid to gas' or something similar.                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                    
I should structure the answer by first stating the process, then explaining it step by step. The process is called vaporization, and
it occurs when molecules gain enough energy to break free from the liquid's surface. This is why when you boil water, it turns into 
steam. The temperature at which this happens is the boiling point, which varies with pressure.                                      
                                                                                                                                    
But to be precise, maybe I should check the exact term used in scientific contexts. So using the web_search tool with the query     
"process of water changing from liquid to gas" to get the accurate term. Then, based on the search result, explain the process.

How Does Water Condense from a Gas to a Liquid? The process by which water vapor changes from a gas to a liquid is called 
condensation. It occurs when water vapor cools down, losing energy and slowing down the movement of its molecules. As a result, the 
water molecules come together and form liquid water droplets.

Cooling Phase - Condensation (Gas to Liquid State) Condensation is the process where gas turns into a liquid. It happens when gas 
cools down enough for its molecules to slow down and bond together. This process can happen when warm, moist air hits a cooler 
surface. This makes the gas molecules lose energy and change back into liquid form.

1. **Energy Gain**: When water is heated, molecules gain kinetic energy, causing them to move faster.                               
2. **Break Free**: As molecules overcome the intermolecular forces in the liquid, they escape into the air as **water vapor** (gas).
3. **Surface Interaction**: Evaporation occurs at the surface of a liquid, where molecules reach the atmospheric saturation point.  
4. **Role in the Water Cycle**: This process drives the water cycle, with evaporation from oceans, lakes, and rivers leading to     
cloud formation and precipitation.

The water cycle is the continuous circulation of water in the Earth's atmosphere. During circulation, water changes between solid, 
liquid, and gas (water vapor) and changes location. The processes involved in the water cycle are evaporation, transpiration, 
condensation, precipitation, and runoff. Figure 11.1.1 11.1. 1: The water cycle. Evaporation is the process by which a liquid is ...

[Evaporation: the conversion of water from a liquid into a gas](http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/(Gh)/guides/mtr/hyd/evap.rxml)
Water is transferred from the surface to the atmosphere through evaporation, the process by which water changes from a liquid to a 
gas. Approximately 80% of all evaporation is from the oceans, with the remaining 20% coming from inland water and vegetation.

How Does Water Condense from a Gas to a Liquid? The process by which water vapor changes from a gas to a liquid is called 
condensation. It occurs when water vapor cools down, losing energy and slowing down the movement of its molecules. As a result, the 
water molecules come together and form liquid water droplets.

[Which process describes water changing from a liquid state to a gas?](https://brainly.com/question/1573933)
Change of State: Those energetic molecules break away from the surface of the liquid and enter the gas phase (water vapor). This 
process occurs at any temperature but is faster at higher temperatures. Condensation vs. Evaporation: It's important to note that 
condensation is the opposite process, where gas turns back into a liquid.

[States of Water: Gas, Liquid and Solid - Earth How](https://earthhow.com/states-of-water/)
Cooling Phase - Condensation (Gas to Liquid State) Condensation is the process where gas turns into a liquid. It happens when gas 
cools down enough for its molecules to slow down and bond together. This process can happen when warm, moist air hits a cooler 
surface. This makes the gas molecules lose energy and change back into liquid form.

1. **Energy Gain**: When water is heated, molecules gain kinetic energy, causing them to move faster.                               
2. **Break Free**: As molecules overcome the intermolecular forces in the liquid, they escape into the air as **water vapor** (gas).
3. **Surface Interaction**: Evaporation occurs at the surface of a liquid, where molecules reach the atmospheric saturation point.  
4. **Role in the Water Cycle**: This process drives the water cycle, with evaporation from oceans, lakes, and rivers leading to     
cloud formation and precipitation.

[How does water turn to gas? - Geographic Pedia - NCESC](https://www.ncesc.com/geographic-pedia/how-does-water-turn-to-gas/)
How Does Water Become Gas? Water becomes a gas through a process called evaporation. When water absorbs enough heat, usually from 
sunlight, the individual water molecules gain enough energy to break free from the liquid state and become water vapor. The rate of 
evaporation depends on several factors, including temperature, humidity, and air ...

Sirintra Pumsopa / Getty Images This photo displays the process of condensation of water vapor into dew drops. Condensation, the 
opposite of evaporation, is the phase change of matter from gas into liquid.

[States of Water: Gas, Liquid and Solid - Earth How](https://earthhow.com/states-of-water/)
Because water is extremely versatile, it changes phases rapidly. The states of water are gas, liquid and solid. Water cycles through
these phases in nature.

[Evaporation and the Water Cycle | U.S. Geological 
Survey](https://www.usgs.gov/special-topics/water-science-school/science/evaporation-and-water-cycle)
Evaporation is the process that changes liquid water to gaseous water (water vapor). Water moves from the Earth's surface to the 
atmosphere via evaporation.

In its gas state, water is invisible, can flow, has no fixed volume and takes the shape of the whole of its container. The process 
in which a liquid changes to a gas is called evaporation. Water can be observed changing from liquid to gas. We can change the state
of a liquid to a gas by heating.

[What are Changes of State? - BYJU'S](https://byjus.com/physics/changing-states-of-matter/)
Vaporization If the water is hot enough, it starts to boil. Bubbles of water vapor are formed in the boiling water. This happens as 
particles of liquid water gain enough energy to completely overcome the force of attraction between them and change to the gaseous 
state. The bubbles rise through the water and escape from the pot as steam. The process in which a liquid boils and changes to a gas

[| Physics Van | Illinois](https://van.physics.illinois.edu/ask/listing/1516)
When this happens, all of the molecules go flying apart and become a gas (like when you boil water to make steam). The process of 
gas molecules leaving the liquid to go into the gas is called "evaporation." The opposite process is called "condensation." Hope 
this answers your question! -Tamara (small mods by mbw)

Vaporization and Condensation When a liquid vaporizes in a closed container, gas molecules cannot escape. As these gas phase 
molecules move randomly about, they will occasionally collide with the surface of the condensed phase, and in some cases, these 
collisions will result in the molecules re-entering the condensed phase. The change from the gas phase to the liquid is called 
condensation ...

[Evaporation: the conversion of water from a liquid into a gas](http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/(Gh)/guides/mtr/hyd/evap.rxml)
Water is transferred from the surface to the atmosphere through evaporation, the process by which water changes from a liquid to a 
gas. Approximately 80% of all evaporation is from the oceans, with the remaining 20% coming from inland water and vegetation.

[How does water turn to gas? - Geographic Pedia - NCESC](https://www.ncesc.com/geographic-pedia/how-does-water-turn-to-gas/)
How Does Water Condense from a Gas to a Liquid? The process by which water vapor changes from a gas to a liquid is called 
condensation. It occurs when water vapor cools down, losing energy and slowing down the movement of its molecules. As a result, the 
water molecules come together and form liquid water droplets.

[Evaporation and the Water Cycle | U.S. Geological Survey - 
USGS.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/special-topics/water-science-school/science/evaporation-and-water-cycle)
Evaporation is the process that changes liquid water to gaseous water (water vapor). Water moves from the Earth's surface to the 
atmosphere via evaporation. Evaporation occurs when energy (heat) forces the bonds that hold water molecules together to break. When
you're boiling water on the stove, you're adding heat to liquid water.

Okay, the user is asking about the process by which water changes from liquid to gas. From the web search results, I need to make 
sure the answer is accurate. The key points from the search results mention the process is called evaporation. When water is heated,
molecules gain energy and escape into the air as vapor. The process involves molecules overcoming intermolecular forces and 
transitioning into the gas state.

I should structure the answer clearly, mentioning the term "evaporation" and explaining the steps. Also, note that this is part of 
the water cycle. The code provided earlier was invalid due to a regex error, so I need to ensure the code is correct. The user's 
previous attempt had a regex issue, so I'll avoid that by using a straightforward code snippet that prints the process name and 
explanation.

The process by which water changes from liquid to gas is called **evaporation**. Here's the explanation:

1. **Energy Gain**: When water is heated, molecules gain kinetic energy, causing them to move faster.
2. **Break Free**: As molecules overcome the intermolecular forces in the liquid, they escape into the air as **water vapor** (gas).
3. **Surface Interaction**: Evaporation occurs at the surface of a liquid, where molecules reach the atmospheric saturation point.
4. **Role in the Water Cycle**: This process drives the water cycle, with evaporation from oceans, lakes, and rivers leading to 
cloud formation and precipitation.

[Evaporation: the conversion of water from a liquid into a gas](http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/(Gh)/guides/mtr/hyd/evap.rxml)
Water is transferred from the surface to the atmosphere through evaporation, the process by which water changes from a liquid to a 
gas. Approximately 80% of all evaporation is from the oceans, with the remaining 20% coming from inland water and vegetation. Winds 
transport the evaporated water around the globe, influencing the humidity of the ...

Okay, the user is asking about the process by which water changes from liquid to gas. From the web search results, I need to make   
sure the answer is accurate. The key points from the search results mention the process is called evaporation. When water is heated,
molecules gain energy and escape into the air as vapor. The process involves molecules overcoming intermolecular forces and         
transitioning into the gas state.                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                    
I should structure the answer clearly, mentioning the term "evaporation" and explaining the steps. Also, note that this is part of  
the water cycle. The code provided earlier was invalid due to a regex error, so I need to ensure the code is correct. The user's    
previous attempt had a regex issue, so I'll avoid that by using a straightforward code snippet that prints the process name and
