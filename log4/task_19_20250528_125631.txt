Okay, the user is asking for the speed of light. I need to find out what that is. I remember
that the speed of light in a vacuum is a fundamental constant. From what I've learned       
before, it's approximately 299,792 kilometers per second. But maybe I should verify this    
using a reliable source.                                                                    
                                                                                            
Wait, the tools available include web search and wiki. So I can use the web_search function 
to look up the exact value. Let me try that. The query should be "speed of light". Let me   
execute the code to get the result.                                                         
</think>                                                                                    
                                                                                            
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the exact speed of light.                   
Code:                                                                                       
```py                                                                                       
speed_of_light = web_search(query="speed of light")

[Speed of light - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_Light)
The speed of light in vacuum, commonly denoted c, is a universal physical constant exactly 
equal to 299,792,458 metres per second (approximately 300,000 kilometres per second; 186,000
miles per second; 671 million miles per hour). It is exact because, by international 
agreement, a metre is defined as the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during 
a time interval of 1 ⁄ 299 792 ...
