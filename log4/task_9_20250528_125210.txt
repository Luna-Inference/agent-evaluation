<think>                                                                                     
Okay, the user is asking for the current distance from Earth to the Moon. I need to find    
that value. Let me think about the tools I have.                                            
                                                                                            
The available tools are web search and visiting web pages. So I should use the web_search   
function. The query should be "distance from Earth to the Moon". Let me check if there's a  
specific source, but since the user didn't specify, a general search should work.           
                                                                                            
I'll perform a web search with that query. The result will give me the latest data. Then I  
can extract the numerical value from the search results and present it as the answer.       
</think>                                                                                    
                                                                                            
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the current distance from Earth to the Moon.
Code:

[Lunar distance - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_distance)
The instantaneous Earth-Moon distance, or distance to the Moon, is the distance from the 
center of Earth to the center of the Moon.In contrast, the Lunar distance (LD or ), or 
Earth-Moon characteristic distance, is a unit of measure in astronomy.More technically, it 
is the semi-major axis of the geocentric lunar orbit.The average lunar distance is 
approximately 385,000 km (239,000 mi), or ...

Facts](https://planetfacts.org/distance-to-the-moon/)
The Moon is not always at a constant distance from the Earth. At times the Moon comes closer
to Earth and at times it is further away. The closest position of the Moon is called lunar 
perigee and the distance at that time is calculated to be 356,700 km (221,643 mi). When the 
Moon is away from Earth, it is called apogee. At apogee, the distance ...
