<think>                                                                                                                             
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Spain. I need to find that out. Let me think about the tools I have.                    
                                                                                                                                    
Hmm, the available tools are web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer. Since the user is asking for a factual answer, web_search 
would be appropriate. I can use the web_search function with the query "capital of Spain" to get the top results. Then, I can       
extract the capital from the search results and return it.                                                                          
                                                                                                                                    
Wait, but how does the web_search tool work? It takes a query and returns the top results. So I'll call web_search with the query   
"capital of Spain". Then, I need to parse the results to find the capital. But since the tool's response is a string, I'll check if 
the first result contains the capital. For example, the first result might be something like "The capital of Spain is Madrid." So I 
can split the string or find the part that mentions the capital.                                                                    
                                                                                                                                    
Alternatively, maybe the web_search returns a list of links, and I can visit the first link to get the full page. But the user's    
question is straightforward, so maybe the first search result already has the answer. Let me proceed with the web_search and then   
check the first result for the capital.                                                                                             
</think>
