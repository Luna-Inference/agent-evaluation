<think>                                                                                     
Okay, the user is asking for the symbol of potassium. I need to figure out what the correct 
symbol is. From what I remember, potassium is a chemical element. The symbols for elements  
are usually one or two letters. Let me think... I think potassium's symbol is K. But wait,  
maybe I should verify this.                                                                 
                                                                                            
Since the user is asking for a straightforward answer, maybe I can use the web search tool  
to check. Let me use the web_search function with the query "symbol for potassium". That    
should return the correct symbol. Once I get the result, I can just present it as the final 
answer.
