<think>                                                                                     
Okay, the user is asking for the capital city of Japan. I need to find that information. Let
me think about the tools I have.                                                            
                                                                                            
First, I can use the web search tool to look up the capital of Japan. The web_search        
function can be used here. The query would be "capital of Japan". Let me check if there's   
any need for translation, but the question is in English, so no need.                       
                                                                                            
I'll call the web_search function with the query. Then, once I get the results, I can       
extract the capital from the first result. The observation will show the search results, and
I can parse them to find the answer.                                                        
                                                                                            
Wait, the user might expect a direct answer. If the web search returns something like "The  
capital of Japan is Tokyo.", then I can take that as the answer. Alternatively, if there are
multiple results, I need to pick the correct one. But since the question is straightforward,
the first result should be sufficient.                                                      
                                                                                            
So the code would be: perform a web search for "capital of Japan", then extract the capital 
from the first result. Then return that as the final answer.                                
</think>                                                                                    
                                                                                            
Thought: I will use the web search tool to find the capital of Japan.                       
Code:                                                                                       
```py                                                                                       
capital_of_japan = web_search(query="capital of Japan")

```
