<think>                                                                                                                             
Okay, the user is asking who wrote "The Great Gatsby." Let me think about how to approach this.                                     
                                                                                                                                    
First, I need to find the author of the book. The book is a classic, so I remember it's written by F. Scott Fitzgerald. But maybe I 
should verify this using a tool to be sure. The available tools include web search and wiki. Let me use the web search tool to check
the top results.                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                    
I'll perform a web search for "The Great Gatsby author" to get the correct information. Then, I can extract the author's name from  
the search results. If the search returns the author's name, I can confirm it and provide the answer. If not, maybe there's a need  
to check another source, but for now, let's proceed with the first step.                                                            
</think>                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                    
Thought: I will use the web search tool to find the author of "The Great Gatsby."

any specific errors, so the answer should be straightforward.
