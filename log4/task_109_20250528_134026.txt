Okay, the user is asking about the process by which ice turns to water. I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me think.      
                                                                                                                                    
First, I remember that when ice melts, it's called melting. But maybe they want the scientific term for this process. The process is
called fusion. But wait, let me make sure. Ice is solid water, and when it melts, it becomes liquid water. So the process is fusion.
But maybe the user wants the full explanation.                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                    
I should check if there's a more detailed process involved. For example, the molecular movement. When ice is frozen, the molecules  
arrange in a crystalline structure. As heat is added, the molecules vibrate more, eventually breaking the bonds and turning into    
liquid. But the main term is fusion. So the answer is fusion. However, maybe the user wants the steps or the scientific term. The   
question is straightforward, so the answer is the process name.                                                                     
</think>                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                    
Thought: I will use the `wiki` tool to find the scientific term for the process by which ice turns to water.

Okay, the user is asking about the process by which ice turns into water. From my knowledge, this process is called fusion. But I   
need to confirm this using the tools available. However, the previous attempt tried to use the 'wiki' tool, which wasn't allowed. So
I need to find another way.                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                    
Since the 'wiki' tool isn't available, maybe I can explain the process directly. Ice turns into water through melting, which is a   
physical change. The molecules in ice move faster and break the rigid structure, turning into a liquid. The scientific term is      
fusion, but maybe the answer expects the common term. Alternatively, the process is called melting. I should check if there's a     
standard term. Since the previous attempt failed, I'll proceed with the common term and explain the process.

Thought: Since the 'wiki' tool is not available, I will explain the process directly based on my knowledge. Ice turns to water      
through melting, a physical process where molecules gain energy and break free from their crystalline structure.
