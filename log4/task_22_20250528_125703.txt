Okay, the user asked for a short poem about the ocean. Let me think about how to approach   
this.                                                                                       
                                                                                            
First, I need to create a poem. The ocean is vast, deep, and full of life. Maybe use imagery
like waves, tides, sea creatures, and the moon. I should make it rhyme, perhaps a simple    
AABB structure.                                                                             
                                                                                            
Let me start with the first line. Something like "The ocean's vast and deep, a endless      
blue." Then the second line could be about waves. "Waves crash on the shore, a mighty       
force."                                                                                     
                                                                                            
Next, maybe talk about the moon and tides. "The moon's soft light, it guides the tides, /   
And brings the stars to dance in the night."                                                
                                                                                            
Adding some elements of life, like fish and coral. "Fish swim in the dark, their tales      
untold, / Coral builds their homes in the deep cold."                                       
                                                                                            
End with a stanza about the ocean's mysteries. "In whispers, it speaks of ancient times, /  
And holds the secrets of the world's embrace."                                              
                                                                                            
I should check the rhythm and rhyme. Each couplet should have a consistent rhyme. Let me    
make sure the lines flow well and the imagery is vivid.                                     
                                                                                            
Now, I'll write the poem and ensure it's concise, keeping each line short. Avoid complex    
words to keep it accessible. Let me put it all together.                                    
</think>                                                                                    
                                                                                            
Thought: I will craft a short poem about the ocean using simple rhyming couplets and vivid  
imagery.
