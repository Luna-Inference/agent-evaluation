<think>                                                                                                                             
Okay, the user is asking who the author of 'Don Quixote' is. I need to figure out how to find this information. Let me think about  
the tools available.                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                    
First, I remember that in the previous examples, the assistant used tools like web_search and wiki. So maybe I can use those here.  
The task is straightforward: find the author of Don Quixote.                                                                        
                                                                                                                                    
I should start by using the web_search tool with the query "author of Don Quixote". That should return the top results. Then, check 
the first result to see if it gives the author's name. If the search returns the correct information, I can extract the author's    
name and present it as the final answer.                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                    
Wait, but the user might want the exact name, so I need to make sure the search result mentions the author. Let me write the code to
perform the search and then parse the result. If the search returns something like "Miguel de Cervantes author of Don Quixote", then
the answer is straightforward. If not, maybe the search needs to be more specific. But given that Don Quixote is a well-known work, 
the search should find the correct author.                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                    
So the steps are: call web_search with the query, then check the result to get the author's name. Then use final_answer to present  
it.                                                                                                                                 
</think>                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                    
Thought: I will use the web_search tool to find the author of "Don Quixote" and then extract the information from the results.      
Code:
