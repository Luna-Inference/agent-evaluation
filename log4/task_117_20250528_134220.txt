<think>                                                                                                                             
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of Portugal. I need to figure out how to get that information. Let me think about the tools
I have available.                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                    
Hmm, the available tools are web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer. Maybe a web search would work here. The question is       
straightforward, so I can use the web_search function with the query "capital of Portugal".                                         
                                                                                                                                    
Wait, I should check if there's any need to visit a specific webpage. But since the user just wants the capital, a general web      
search should suffice. Let me call the web_search function with the appropriate query.                                              
                                                                                                                                    
Once I get the results, I can parse them to find the capital. But according to the rules, I should use the tools as they are. So    
I'll execute the code to perform the search and then present the answer.
