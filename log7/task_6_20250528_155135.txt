<think>                                                                                                                    
Okay, I need to translate "Good morning" into Spanish. Let me think about the tools I have. The available tools are        
web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer. Since this is a straightforward translation, maybe I don't need to use any    
tools. I remember that "Good morning" in Spanish is "Buenos días". But wait, should I confirm using a tool? The user might 
want the correct formal translation. Alternatively, maybe use the web_search tool to verify. But the task seems simple     
enough that I can answer directly. However, the rules say I should use the tools when needed. But in this case, since it's 
a common phrase, perhaps it's safe to answer without a tool. But the instructions say to use the tools if needed. Hmm.     
Wait, the user might expect me to use the translator tool, but the available tools don't include a translator function. The
tools are web_search, visit_webpage, and final_answer. So I can't use a translator tool. Therefore, I should use web_search
to find the translation. Let me do that.                                                                                   
                                                                                                                           
So, the thought is: I will use web_search to find the translation of "Good morning" to Spanish. Then, extract the answer   
from the search results.                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                           
Then, the code would be: search_result = web_search("Good morning in Spanish"). Then print the result. Then, based on the  
observation, extract the answer and use final_answer.                                                                      
                                                                                                                           
But maybe the search results will have the answer. Let me proceed step by step.
