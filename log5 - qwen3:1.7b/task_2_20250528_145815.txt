<think>                                                                                                                    
Okay, the user is asking who wrote "Pride and Prejudice". I need to figure out how to find this information. Let me think  
about the tools available. The previous examples used web searches and wiki queries. Maybe I can use the web_search tool   
here.                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                           
First, I should perform a web search for the book "Pride and Prejudice" to find the author. The query would be something   
like "who wrote Pride and Prejudice". Then, I can check the results to get the author's name.                              
                                                                                                                           
Wait, the user mentioned using the tools provided. The web_search function takes a query string. So I'll call web_search   
with the query "who wrote Pride and Prejudice". Then, the result should give the author, probably a direct answer. Once I  
get that, I can use the final_answer tool to present the answer.                                                           
</think>
