Graphene is the hardest man-made material, 200 times more powerful than steel. Diamonds are the strongest material we can find in nature, measuring between 70 and 150 GPa on the Vickers Hardness Test. Kevlar is a material that was often used to replace classic steel rims in race-cars because it weighs much less, and it is far more sturdy.
