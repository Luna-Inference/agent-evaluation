Boiling Point of Water. At sea level, water boils at 212 degrees Fahrenheit(212°F) or 100 degrees Celsius (100°C). Water's boiling point changes as altitude is increased or decreased. For example, at 1,000 feet below sea level, water boils at 213.9°F (101.1°C). At 1,000 feet above sea level, water's boiling point is 210.1°F (98.9°C ...

[At What Temperature Does Water Boil - Status Hub](https://status.asucd.ucdavis.edu/at-what-temperature-does-water-boil)
Key Points. The standard boiling point of water at 1 atm is 100 degrees Celsius (°C) or 212 degrees Fahrenheit (°F). Boiling point elevation occurs when solutes are added to water, increasing its boiling point. At higher altitudes, the boiling point of water decreases due to lower atmospheric pressure.

[How hot is boiling water? - The Environmental Literacy Council](https://enviroliteracy.org/how-hot-is-boiling-water/)
While 212°F (100°C) is the widely accepted boiling point of water, several factors can influence this temperature: Atmospheric Pressure: Pressure and boiling point are intertwined. The higher the altitude, the lower the atmospheric pressure, and the lower the boiling point. ... Can water exist at 200 degrees Celsius? Yes, but only as steam ...
