[Pythagoras Theorem - Formula, Proof, Examples - Cuemath](https://www.cuemath.com/geometry/pythagoras-theorem/)
The Pythagorean theorem formula states that in a right triangle ABC, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two legs. If AB and AC are the sides and BC is the hypotenuse of the triangle, then: BC 2 = AB 2 + AC 2 . In this case, AB is the base, AC is the altitude or the height, and BC is the hypotenuse.
