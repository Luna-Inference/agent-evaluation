Okay, I need to summarize the theory of relativity in one sentence. Let me think about how to approach this.               
                                                                                                                           
First, I should recall what the theory of relativity entails. There are two parts: special relativity and general          
relativity. Special relativity deals with objects moving at constant speeds, especially those approaching the speed of     
light, and introduces concepts like time dilation and length contraction. General relativity is about gravity, describing  
it as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy.                                                                
                                                                                                                           
But the user wants a one-sentence summary. So I need to be concise. Maybe start by mentioning Einstein's theory, then touch
on both aspects. Words like "framework" or "theory" could be useful. Also, mention that it's about the relationship between
space and time, and how gravity affects them.                                                                              
                                                                                                                           
Wait, should I mention both special and general relativity? Maybe, but in one sentence. Perhaps phrase it as "The theory of
relativity, developed by Albert Einstein, describes how gravity is the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy,   
and how objects move along geodesic paths in this curved spacetime, with special relativity addressing the physics of      
objects moving at constant velocities and general relativity extending this to accelerated frames and gravity."            
                                                                                                                           
But that's a bit long. Let me shorten it. Combine the key points: spacetime curvature due to mass, gravity as a result, and
maybe the effects on time and space. Maybe something like: "The theory of relativity, formulated by Albert Einstein, posits
that gravity arises from the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy, and that time and space are interwoven into 
a single continuum affected by motion and gravity."                                                                        
                                                                                                                           
Yes, that's concise and covers both aspects. Let me check if that's accurate. It mentions Einstein, the two main components
(spacetime curvature and the interwoven nature of time and space), and the effects of motion and gravity. That seems right.
I think that's a solid one-sentence summary.                                                                               
</think>                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                           
Thought: I need to create a concise summary of the theory of relativity. Since this is a well-known theory, I can rely on  
my existing knowledge without needing to search for information.

```py                                                                                                                      
summary = "The theory of relativity, formulated by Albert Einstein, posits that gravity arises from the curvature of       
spacetime caused by mass and energy, and that time and space are interwoven into a single continuum affected by motion and 
gravity."
