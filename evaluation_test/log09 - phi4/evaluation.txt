DETAILED EVALUATIONS FOR log09 - phi4
================================================================================

Evaluation 1/5: Explain quantum entanglement simply.
------------------------------------------------------------
Task: Explain quantum entanglement simply.
Answer: No answer found

Correctness: error
Misunderstanding count: 0
Category: unknown
Self-confidence: unknown

Step count: 2
Failure count: 0
Total tokens: 0 (Input: 0, Output: 0)
Total time: 142.25 seconds

Explanation: Error during evaluation: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Evaluation 2/5: What is the largest continent?
------------------------------------------------------------
Task: What is the largest continent?
Answer: Asia

Correctness: yes
Misunderstanding count: 0
Category: general knowledge
Self-confidence: high

Step count: 2
Failure count: 0
Total tokens: 0 (Input: 0, Output: 0)
Total time: 63.23 seconds

Explanation: The final answer 'Asia' is correct. The agent took two steps to reach the answer, performed a tool call without misusing it, and showed high self-confidence since this is common knowledge.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Evaluation 3/5: Name a continent that lies entirely in the Southern Hemisphere.
------------------------------------------------------------
Task: Name a continent that lies entirely in the Southern Hemisphere.
Answer: Antarctica

Correctness: yes
Misunderstanding count: 0
Category: general knowledge
Self-confidence: high

Step count: 1
Failure count: 0
Total tokens: 0 (Input: 0, Output: 0)
Total time: 27.52 seconds

Explanation: The agent correctly identified Antarctica as the continent located entirely in the Southern Hemisphere in one step, with no failures or misuse of tools.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Evaluation 4/5: What is the largest bone in the human body?
------------------------------------------------------------
Task: What is the largest bone in the human body?
Answer: femur

Correctness: yes
Misunderstanding count: 0
Category: general knowledge
Self-confidence: high

Step count: 2
Failure count: 0
Total tokens: 0 (Input: 0, Output: 0)
Total time: 120.48 seconds

Explanation: The agent correctly identified the femur as the largest bone with no tool misuse. The process involved two steps (one web search and one final answer), with no code execution failures.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Evaluation 5/5: List the first 5 prime numbers.
------------------------------------------------------------
Task: List the first 5 prime numbers.
Answer: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]

Correctness: yes
Misunderstanding count: 0
Category: math
Self-confidence: high

Step count: 1
Failure count: 0
Total tokens: 0 (Input: 0, Output: 0)
Total time: 40.93 seconds

Explanation: The final answer correctly lists the first five prime numbers ([2, 3, 5, 7, 11]). The process involved only one clear step with no code execution failures or tool misuse, and the problem is basic math/common knowledge.
