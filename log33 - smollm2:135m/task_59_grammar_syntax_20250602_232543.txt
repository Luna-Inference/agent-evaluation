Here are three examples with informative explanations for both restrictive and non-restrictive relative clauses:                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1.  **Restrictive clause:**                                                                                                                                                      
The sentence "This book is on the shelf" is a restrictive clause because it implies that this specific sentence needs to be examined in order to understand what's next (the     
other two sentences). Without this clause, the reader would not know that another reading of the next sentence takes place.                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2.  **Non-restrictive clause:**                                                                                                                                                  
The sentence "This book is on the shelf" is a non-restrictive clause because it does not imply that the book needs to be examined in order for us (the other two sentences) to   
understand what's next. Without this clause, we would still know that another reading of the next sentence takes place, but wouldn't have any information about what happens     
after that first reading.                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3.  **Example with non-restrictive clauses:**                                                                                                                                    
In the following example, a non-restrictive clause (in parentheses) is used to provide additional context:                                                                       
"The hotel room was in good condition."                                                                                                                                          
Here, "good condition" provides more information about what's next than "this book", which requires a specific sentence for us to understand. This demonstrates how restrictive  
clauses can help clarify relationships between clauses.

            Here are three examples with informative explanations for both restrictive and non-restrictive relative clauses:

1.  **Restrictive clause:**
The sentence "This book is on the shelf" is a restrictive clause because it implies that this specific sentence needs to be examined in order to understand what's next (the 
other two sentences). Without this clause, the reader would not know that another reading of the next sentence takes place.

2.  **Non-restrictive clause:**
The sentence "This book is on the shelf" is a non-restrictive clause because it does not imply that the book needs to be examined in order for us (the other two sentences) to 
understand what's next. Without this clause, we would still know that another reading of the next sentence takes place, but wouldn't have any information about what happens 
after that first reading.

3.  **Example with non-restrictive clauses:**
In the following example, a non-restrictive clause (in parentheses) is used to provide additional context:
"The hotel room was in good condition."
Here, "good condition" provides more information about what's next than "this book", which requires a specific sentence for us to understand. This demonstrates how restrictive 
clauses can help clarify relationships between clauses.

Here are three examples with informative explanations for both restrictive and non-restrictive relative clauses:                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1.  **Restrictive clause:**                                                                                                                                                      
The sentence "This book is on the shelf" is a restrictive clause because it implies that this specific sentence needs to be examined in order to understand what's next (the     
other two sentences). Without this clause, the reader would not know that another reading of the next sentence takes place.                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2.  **Non-restrictive clause:**                                                                                                                                                  
The sentence "This book is on the shelf" is a non-restrictive clause because it does not imply that the book needs to be examined in order for us (the other two sentences) to   
understand what's next. Without this clause, we would still know that another reading of the next sentence takes place, but wouldn't have any information about what happens     
after that first reading.                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3.  **Example with non-restrictive clauses:**                                                                                                                                    
In the following example, a non-restrictive clause (in parentheses) is used to provide additional context:                                                                       
"The hotel room was in good condition."                                                                                                                                          
Here, "good condition" provides more information about what's next than "this book", which requires a specific sentence for us to understand. This demonstrates how restrictive  
clauses can help clarify relationships between clauses.                                                                                                                          
            Make sure to include code with the correct pattern, for instance:

after that first reading.                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3.  **Example with non-restrictive clauses:**                                                                                                                                    
In the following example, a non-restrictive clause (in parentheses) is used to provide additional context:                                                                       
"The hotel room was in good condition."                                                                                                                                          
Here, "good condition" provides more information about what's next than "this book", which requires a specific sentence for us to understand. This demonstrates how restrictive  
clauses can help clarify relationships between clauses.                                                                                                                          
            Make sure to include code with the correct pattern, for instance:

            Here are three examples with informative explanations for both restrictive and non-restrictive relative clauses:

1.  **Restrictive clause:**
The sentence "This book is on the shelf" is a restrictive clause because it implies that this specific sentence needs to be examined in order to understand what's next (the 
other two sentences). Without this clause, the reader would not know that another reading of the next sentence takes place.

2.  **Non-restrictive clause:**
The sentence "This book is on the shelf" is a non-restrictive clause because it does not imply that the book needs to be examined in order for us (the other two sentences) to

after that first reading.

3.  **Example with non-restrictive clauses:**

"The hotel room was in good condition."
Here, "good condition" provides more information about what's next than "this book", which requires a specific sentence for us to understand. This demonstrates how restrictive 
clauses can help clarify relationships between clauses.

            Here are three examples with informative explanations for both restrictive and non-restrictive relative clauses:

1.  **Restrictive clause:**
The sentence "This book is on the shelf" is a restrictive clause because it implies that this specific sentence needs to be examined in order to understand what's next (the 
other two sentences). Without this clause, the reader would not know that another reading of the next sentence takes place.

2.  **Non-restrictive clause:**
The sentence "This book is on the shelf" is a non-restrictive clause because it does not imply that the book needs to be examined in order for us (the other two sentences) to 
understand what's next. Without this clause, we would still know that another reading of the next sentence takes place, but wouldn't have any information about what happens 
after that first reading.

3.  **Example with non-restrictive clauses:**
In the following example, a non-restrictive clause (in parentheses) is used to provide additional context:
"The hotel room was in good condition."
Here, "good condition" provides more information about what's next than "this book", which requires a specific sentence for us to understand. This demonstrates how restrictive 
clauses can help clarify relationships between clauses.

            Here are three examples with informative explanations for both restrictive and non-restrictive relative clauses:

1.  **Restrictive clause:**
The sentence "This book is on the shelf" is a restrictive clause because it implies that this specific sentence needs to be examined in order to understand what's next (the 
other two sentences). Without this clause, the reader would not know that another reading of the next sentence takes place.

2.  **Non-restrictive clause:**
The sentence "This book is on the shelf" is a non-restrictive clause because it does not imply that the book needs to be examined in order for us (the other two sentences) to 
understand what's next. Without this clause, we would still know that another reading of the next sentence takes place, but wouldn't have any information about what happens 
after that first reading.

3.  **Example with non-restrictive clauses:**
In the following example, a non-restrictive clause (in parentheses) is used to provide additional context:
"The hotel room was in good condition."
Here, "good condition" provides more information about what's next than "this book", which requires a specific sentence for us to understand. This demonstrates how restrictive 
clauses can help clarify relationships between clauses.

1.  **Restrictive clause:**                                                                                                                                                      
The sentence "This book is on the shelf" is a restrictive clause because it implies that this specific sentence needs to be examined in order to understand what's next (the     
other two sentences). Without this clause, the reader would not know that another reading of the next sentence takes place.                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2.  **Non-restrictive clause:**                                                                                                                                                  
The sentence "This book is on the shelf" is a non-restrictive clause because it does not imply that the book needs to be examined in order for us (the other two sentences) to   
understand what's next. Without this clause, we would still have some information about the next reader of the next sentence, but wouldn't know how much more is required before 
moving on from this specific sentence.                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3.  **Example with non-restrictive clauses:**                                                                                                                                    
In the following example, a non-restrictive clause (in parentheses) is used to provide additional context:                                                                       
"The hotel room was in good condition."                                                                                                                                          
Here, "good condition" provides more information about what's next than "this book", which requires a specific sentence for us to understand. This demonstrates how restrictive  
clauses can help clarify relationships between clauses.                                                                                                                          
            Make sure to include code with the correct pattern, for instance:

            ```py

moving on from this specific sentence.                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3.  **Example with non-restrictive clauses:**                                                                                                                                    
In the following example, a non-restrictive clause (in parentheses) is used to provide additional context:                                                                       
"The hotel room was in good condition."                                                                                                                                          
Here, "good condition" provides more information about what's next than "this book", which requires a specific sentence for us to understand. This demonstrates how restrictive  
clauses can help clarify relationships between clauses.                                                                                                                          
            Make sure to include code with the correct pattern, for instance:

            Here are three examples with informative explanations for both restrictive and non-restrictive relative clauses:

1.  **Restrictive clause:**
The sentence "This book is on the shelf" is a restrictive clause because it implies that this specific sentence needs to be examined in order to understand what's next (the 
other two sentences). Without this clause, the reader would not know that another reading of the next sentence takes place.

2.  **Non-restrictive clause:**

"The hotel room was in good condition."
Here, "good condition" provides more information about what's next than "this book", which requires a specific sentence for us to understand. This demonstrates how restrictive 
clauses can help clarify relationships between clauses.

            Here are three examples with informative explanations for both restrictive and non-restrictive relative clauses:

1.  **Restrictive clause:**
The sentence "This book is on the shelf" is a restrictive clause because it implies that this specific sentence needs to be examined in order to understand what's next (the 
other two sentences). Without this clause, the reader would not know that another reading of the next sentence takes place.

2.  **Non-restrictive clause:**
The sentence "This book is on the shelf" is a non-restrictive clause because it does not imply that the book needs to be examined in order for us (the other two sentences) to 
understand what's next. Without this clause, we would still have some information about the next reader of the next sentence, but wouldn't know how much more is required before 
moving on from this specific sentence.

3.  **Example with non-restrictive clauses:**
In the following example, a non-restrictive clause (in parentheses) is used to provide additional context:
"The hotel room was in good condition."
Here, "good condition" provides more information about what's next than "this book", which requires a specific sentence for us to understand. This demonstrates how restrictive 
clauses can help clarify relationships between clauses.
            Make sure to include code with the correct pattern, for instance:
            Thoughts: Your thoughts
            Code:
            ```py
            # Your python code here
            ```<end_code>
            Make sure to include code with the correct pattern, for instance:
            Thoughts: Your thoughts
            Code:
            ```py

            ```<end_code>

Reached max steps.
[Step 21: Duration 10.57 seconds| Input tokens: 138,703 | Output tokens: 6,281]

Output:
1. Restrictive clause: In this example, restrictive clause is used because it implies that the sentence "This book is on the shelf" requires a specific sentence for us to understand what's next (the other two sentences) in order to be considered complete and therefore not too restrictive for an outside reader.

2. Non-restrictive clause: In this example, non-restrictive clause is used because it does not imply that the book needs to be examined in order for us (the other two sentences) to understand what's next. The sentence "This book is on the shelf" is considered restrictive and therefore free of restrictions and allows a certain amount of scope and freedom from constraints.

3. Example with non-restrictive clauses: In this example, a non-restrictive clause (in parentheses) is used to provide additional context: in this sentence "This book is on the shelf", we do not need to ask for clarification about whether or not the book is available at the hotel room but rather what specific reason was provided that allowed us to conclude it's suitable for use there.

Task 59 complete.
