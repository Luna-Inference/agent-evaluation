To solve this system of linear equations, we first need to identify all possible pairs of values for x that satisfy both equations.                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
From equation 3x + 2y = 12, we can find two distinct solutions if x is not equal to zero: x = -6 and x = 4. Similarly, from equation x - y = 1, we have two distinct solutions   
only if x = 0 or x = -0 (since a linear combination of these points implies that the coefficient of y must be non-zero).                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Therefore, there are three possible values for x: (-6,-2) and (4,1), but not both. However, since we need to solve this system with only one variable from equation 3x + 2y = 12,
all other combinations of values will also result in a solution pair where the coefficient of y is zero or non-zero.                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So, the correct solution set for the given system is (4,1) and (-6,-2). We can verify that these are indeed distinct by plugging them into either equation 3x + 2y = 12 or x - y 
= 1 to check if there's a contradiction.

To solve the system of linear equations using only one variable from equation 3x + 2y = 12 and x - y = 1, we will use substitution or elimination method with integer            
coefficients for both variables (a and b).                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
In this case, since we want to solve the system with only one variable from equation 3x + 2y = 12 but a coefficient of zero for x, we can multiply both sides by 4. This results

Now, let's solve for y:                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
70 - 39 = 12

We are left with a solution pair where the coefficient of y is zero or non-zero. In this case, since x must be real (both positive and negative), we can find these solutions    
using the equation x = -6 + y for all values of y except z when it equals 0:

We have found a pair of equations with two distinct solutions.                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So, the correct solution set is (4,1) and (-6,-2). We can verify that these are indeed distinct by plugging them into either equation 3x + 2y = 12 or x - y = 1 to check if      
there's a contradiction.

70 + 58 - 3y = 12

70 - 39 = 12
-39 = 12

We are left with a solution pair where the coefficient of y is zero or non-zero. In this case, since x must be real (both positive and negative), we can find these solutions 
using the equation x = -6 + y for all values of y except z when it equals 0:

4 = -39
z ≠ 0
We have found a pair of equations with two distinct solutions.

We also need to find two equations with one variable x and solve for y.                                                                                                          
Now we have:

So, the correct solution set is (4,-2) and (-6,2). We can verify that these are indeed distinct by plugging them into either equation 3x + 2y = 12 or x - y = 1 to check if      
there's a contradiction.

In this case, since we want to solve the system with only one variable from equation 3x + 2y = 12 but a coefficient of zero for x, we can multiply both sides by 4. This results 
in:

3(4 - y) + 2(-6 + y) = 12
70 + 58 - 3y = 12
-39 - 3y = 12
We also need to find two equations with one variable x and solve for y.
Now we have:

70 = -40
z ≠ 0
So, the correct solution set is (4,-2) and (-6,2). We can verify that these are indeed distinct by plugging them into either equation 3x + 2y = 12 or x - y = 1 to check if 
there's a contradiction.

To solve the system of linear equations using only one variable from equation 3x + 2y = 12 and x - y = 1 with integer coefficients for both variables (a and b), we will use     
substitution or elimination method with integer coefficients for both variables (a and b).                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
In this case, since we want to solve the system with only one variable from equation 3x + 2y = 12 but a coefficient of zero for x, we can multiply both sides by 4. This results 
in:                                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3(4 - y) + 2(-6 + y) = 12                                                                                                                                                        
70 + 58 - 3y = 12                                                                                                                                                                
-39 - 3y = 12                                                                                                                                                                    
We also need to find two equations with one variable x and solve for y.                                                                                                          
Now we have:                                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
70 = -40                                                                                                                                                                         
z ≠ 0                                                                                                                                                                            
So, the correct solution set is (4,-2) and (-6,2). We can verify that these are indeed distinct by plugging them into either equation 3x + 2y = 12 or x - y = 1 to check if      
there's a contradiction.

In this case, since we want to solve the system with only one variable from equation 3x + 2y = 12 but a coefficient of zero for x, we can multiply both sides by 4. This results 
in:

3(4 - y) + 2(-6 + y) = 12
