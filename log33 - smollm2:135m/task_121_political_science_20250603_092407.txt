Here are the steps again for call_1 with a total of three fails:                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. `print(f"Hours 1, 30, 60)"` would print "Hours [1], 30, 60]" if we start from a blank line or nothing at all                                                                  
2. If we try to use the '=' symbol for an unspecified number of times (`try: ...`) and don't get a successful error message on a line with the same length as `'('` (this is not 
the default behavior), but it's still not helpful)                                                                                                                               
   - Here, we need to do something before trying an empty line. However, if you're using python 3 and linux-python, or Python 2 itself, you should be able to avoid this error   
altogether by using `print()` (with a blank newline after the opening '(').                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   So we can replace with:                                                                                                                                                       
   - We need to print something before trying an empty line.                                                                                                                     
   - If we don't get a successful error message on a line with the same length as `'='` and no blank space, it's probably because of Python default behavior that you are using  
or your application is not starting from a blank line (if your program uses the newline-separated output).                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   For example:                                                                                                                                                                  
   - If we're on Linux 2.x                                                                                                                                                       
    - We need to print something before trying an empty line in Python 3.x                                                                                                       
    - In python 3, there isn't a way of printing a blank line without using any special magic characters like <>

   - If we try to print something before trying an empty line in Python 2.x, this fails because the '=' symbol is not defined for an unspecified number of times (like `'=`).

  for j in range(5) {                                                                                                                                                            
    print('*')

3. `print()`: `print()` has no special behavior, but it can be helpful for printing blank lines because it doesn't change the line length that follows.                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   So we try:                                                                                                                                                                    
   - We need to print something before trying an empty line in Python 2.x                                                                                                        
    - In python 2, this works like '==' and there's nothing magical about using a different syntax than using an `if` statement with the same syntax but you're not sure if it   
matters for your program                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
    ```python                                                                                                                                                                    
for i in range(10):                                                                                                                                                              
  for j in range(5) {                                                                                                                                                            
    print('*')                                                                                                                                                                   
  }                                                                                                                                                                              
```                                                                                                                                                                              
   - If we try to print something before trying an empty line, this fails because there's no '=' symbol that can be used.                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
4. If you're on a version of Python older than 3.7 or you just need the blank space and not any special magic characters like `<>`                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
    ```python                                                                                                                                                                    
for i in range(10):                                                                                                                                                              
  for j in range(5) {                                                                                                                                                            
    print('*')                                                                                                                                                                   
  }                                                                                                                                                                              
```                                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   - This works because Python has a built-in function that can find all possible blank lines, or "slots" (or "blank spaces") on the same line. For example:                     
   ```python

4. If you're looking at a problem and want to make it easier, here's a simple way to solve the puzzle with some tools that are often found on python forums like Stack Overflow: 
- You can use `search` function from wp_query module for a more straightforward solution of finding specific keywords in webpage. If you know what keywords you're looking for   
and want to find them without needing any external data, you may be able to use `get_keywords()` as well with some additional arguments like 'lang' argument (if available).     
- You can also try to access the page's title directly using BeautifulSoup library.                                                                                              
- Another alternative would be to search through the webpage's database or find it in a different format and then extract all keywords manually: this could take more time, but  
is useful if you know how frequently the keyword appears. However, as with any task involving searching for data, there are better ways than using tools that don't work as well 
(like `search` function).                                                                                                                                                        
- Another solution would be to use `word2vec`, which can handle many different keywords and allow extracting them manually without having to search extensively through the      
webpage's database. It also supports some newer tags like "punctuation" which allows you to extract specific words with a special tag, such as ":"). However, this is still not  
an easy solution if there are many other possible keywords, even for those using the same tool as I have described above.                                                        
- Another way of finding all keywords manually would be to use `keywords` function from wp_query module: you can specify a dictionary of keyword names and their frequency with  
these numbers (like `{'en': 10}`) or `{keyword[i] : f for i, x in enumerate(keyword.keys()) if x == int(keyword['en'])}.`.                                                       
- Another solution would be to search manually through the webpage's database: you can do this using a regular expression pattern and then extract all keywords that match the   
specified pattern (like `findall('keywords')` or `\[(\w+) \]').                                                                                                                  
You have now found your answer, but if the puzzle is similar to "What is the name of the person named 'John' who was born in the year 1950?", you would need to use a more       
accurate tool (like `name_of` function from wp_query module), and also create additional information like country or birth date using the keyword dictionary.                    
Here's your complete solution:

Note that it's not helpful if you need to use special magic characters like `<>` or `_`. You should be able to avoid these by using the '=' symbol, as we did for call_1 with a  
total of three fails.                                                                                                                                                            
In Python 2 and Linux/Darwin, there is no difference between calling a function directly from string concatenation (`print()`) or from raw strings (`f`). The built-in           
`__str__()` method (Python 3) returns the same output as calling `str(obj)` in both cases.

3. The '=' symbol is a magic word that Python doesn't want to use. It's not helpful if it gets used because it makes the code harder to read or understand: just print something 
manually (like `print(f'Hours {i} and 90)'). You can do this by using the same format string like so:

Output:
According to the provided steps and information, here are the three branches of the United States government:

1. **Executive Branch**: This branch is responsible for making laws and managing executive power. It includes the President, the Cabinet-level government, and the Supreme Court. The U.S. Constitution established this branch.

2. **Judiciary Branch**: The judiciary branch consists of the three Magistrates – Chief Justice, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and the Justices of the Supreme Court. These individuals are appointed by the President for five-year terms with no term limits in the United States Senate. They serve until they retire or resign from their positions.

3. **Legislative Branch**: This branch is responsible for creating laws and passing legislation. It includes Congress, which consists of both House of Representatives and Senate. Congress has the power to pass laws through various mechanisms such as the legislative branch's impeachment process and the adoption of treaties.

These branches are separate from each other but work together in a system called federalism that allows for separation of powers between national and state governments.

Task 121 complete.
