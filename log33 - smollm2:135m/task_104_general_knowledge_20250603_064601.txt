Based on global data from the United Nations' World Population Prospects 2019 (WPP), here are the top-three countries with the largest populations according to total, human     
population, and percentage of people under the age of 30:                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. India - With a population of approximately 1.46 billion people                                                                                                                
2. China - With a population of about 1.59 billion people (according to latest data from the United Nations Population Fund)                                                     
3. Russia - With a population of around 148 million people, but according to latest data from the United States Census Bureau's official U.S. population estimates and other     
sources, Russia is not actually the largest country in terms of total population or human population. However, it has the highest percentage of people under the age of 30 (as   
measured by the World Bank, with a 15% decline between 2014 and 2019) among all countries listed as having the most people aged 16 years or older worldwide from 2014 to 2018.   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So, in summary, China is the largest country by population according to total (approximately 1.5 billion), while Russia has a lower percentage of people under the age of 30 and 
is not listed among countries with the highest percentages of people aged 16 years or older worldwide from 2014-2018, but it still has a large number of population.
