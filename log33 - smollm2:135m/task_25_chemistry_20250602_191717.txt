Chemical Formula for Water: H2O                                                                                                                                                  
This is a common compound and one often confused with another simple molecule, water (H2O). Here's the chemical formula:                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. The 2 elements: H, O, and two other elements, typically denoted by 'Atomic Number' or 'Unevenness', which are called 'Hydroxides'.                                            
The Hydroxide is the bond that forms between the hydrogen atoms of a molecule.                                                                                                   
2. The 4 Elements: All known chemical compounds have one more element than they can hold as bonds (the number '4'). This means that all water molecules will form covalent bonds 
with oxygen, which makes it an example of a compound called H2O or HOH for short (Water of Organization).

Output:
The chemical formula for water is H2O. This is because each molecule of water consists of two hydrogen atoms (H) and one oxygen atom (O). The number of hydrogen atoms in a molecule determines the chemical properties of that particular compound, such as its boiling point, melting point, and reactivity.

Task 25 complete.
