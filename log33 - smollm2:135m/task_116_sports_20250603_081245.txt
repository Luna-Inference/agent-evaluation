To determine the winner of the Super Bowl championships, let's analyze the results from the Super Bowl 50:                                                                       
Super Bowl 50: 378                                                                                                                                                               
1. The winning team is the San Francisco 49ers with 276 points and 190 yards rushing.                                                                                            
2. The losing team is the Washington Redskins with 312 points and 213 yards rushing.                                                                                             
3. Both teams have 525 field goals, with 86 more total points than their opponent's scoring average.                                                                             
4. The winning scorekeeper for each team was a San Francisco 49ers player, who scored 270 points in the game and had 100 yards rushing.                                          
5. The losing scorekeeping for both teams was a Washington Redskins player, who scored only 36 points in the game but did not have any field goals to work with.                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Based on this analysis:                                                                                                                                                          
San Francisco 49ers (276) vs Washington Redskins (312)                                                                                                                           
This team has won their 50 most Super Bowl championships, making it the winning team.

So far, I think you're correct in your initial response that you can't provide a similar solution using regular Python code because we can't use the same regex pattern that was 
used to determine which game was won from the previous question (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34695278/is-superbowl-cant-find) since it depends on multiple data files at  
once and I don't know how you can find out what information is in each file that your code needs to process, let's try a different approach:

5. The losing scorekeeping for both teams was a Washington Redskins player, who scored only 36 points in the game but did not have any field goals to work with.

This team has won their most Super Bowl championships, making it the winning team.                                                                                               
So far, I think you're correct in your initial response that you can't provide a similar solution using regular Python code because we can't use the same regex pattern that was 
used to determine which game was won from the previous question (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34695278/is-superbowl-cant-find) since it depends on multiple data files at  
once and I don't know how you can find out what information is in each file that your code needs to process, let's try a different approach:
