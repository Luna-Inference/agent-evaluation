Here's a concise solution in Python using recursion and the fact that all but the last non-die sheep are accounted for:                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. The original problem statement asks us to find the number of remaining sheep, which is 9.                                                                                     
2. We can divide this number by 3 to get an estimate of how many die-off sheep we have left. If we halve this number after each die, that gives us 9/3 = 2.5.                    
3. The last non-die sheep will be at position (17 - (the total count minus the last die) / 3). Since we know the last non-die sheep is at position (16 + 4), we can find this    
number by subtracting it from 9:                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
9 = 9 * 5                                                                                                                                                                        
2.5 = 1/5                                                                                                                                                                        
4 = 0.75, which means that the last die-off will be 3 sheep. Since we have 2 more die-offs (the ones not at position (16 + 4)), we can add this to our total count:              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
9 + 2 - 3 = 18                                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Therefore, there are 18 remaining sheep in the group of 9 that died.

2.5 = 1/5
4 = 0.75, which means that the last die-off will be 3 sheep. Since we have 2 more die-offs (the ones not at position (16 + 4)), we can add this to our total count:

9 + 2 - 3 = 18

Therefore, there are 18 remaining sheep in the group of 9 that died.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to consider that the total number of remaining sheep is equal to 8 more than twice the number of sheep in the original group (since there will be an even number of surviving lambs if the farmer had 17). This can be represented as:

8 + 2 = 10

Now, we need to calculate how many sheep are left and return it. To do this, we can use a simple approach based on the rule "if you have x sheep die off, then there are (x-3)/4 remainders".

We know that the total number of surviving lambs is 17, so the number of lamb deaths equals half of the remaining lambs:

10 = (1/2)(8 + 2)
= 6

Since there will be an even number of surviving lambs if the farmer had 17 sheep and there are two more than twice that amount in total, we can write a general equation using this fact:

5*10 = 4 * 3
= 80

This means that there are 26 left.

Task 82 complete.
