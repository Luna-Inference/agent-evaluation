Task: Analyze the multiple causal factors contributing to the 2008 financial crisis, including its interconnected nature.                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Financial Crisis: This is a complex issue related to issues of asset markets, confidence in central banks, financial institutions, governments, the global economy, monetary  
policy and banking system structure, corporate governance, and systemic risk.                                                                                                    
2. Asset Market Fluctuations: In 2008, major stock market crashes occurred globally including Russia's Sino-Russian War (the S&P/500 index hit its lowest level since the dot-com
bubble), Japan's Tigers' credit crisis and Europe's Bank of England collapse.                                                                                                    
3. Credit Crisis: Financial institutions experienced a significant credit contraction in 2007, 2010, and 2011 due to increased leverage on mortgages and loans taken out by      
homebuyers who had defaulted on their investments. This led to the massive write-downs of housing inventory which resulted in over $8 trillion (US) worth of losses for          
homebuyers worldwide.                                                                                                                                                            
4. Central Bank Policy Response: In 2008, the US Federal Reserve and other central banks took steps to reduce asset price bubbles by lowering interest rates. This policy helped 
limit the credit expansion that was driving up stock market values. The Fed's action led to a contraction of the housing market in which homebuyers saw their income levels fall 
as mortgage-related assets appreciated significantly, with over $1 trillion (US) worth of homes sold and fewer than 60,000 units being sold in total.                            
5. Inflation: The sharp drop in inflation from 2007 to 2008 led the value of the US dollar plummeted against most other currencies due to a massive increase in monetary policy  
measures taken by central banks including quantitative easing (ZIRP). This accelerated the depreciation and further reduced the purchasing power of the dollar.                  
6. Economic Impact: The crash had significant economic impact on 34 countries worldwide that suffered financial crises during this time, with a total loss of approximately $20  
trillion in US dollars. The global crisis also led to an increase in stock market volatility which contributed to the sharp decline of housing prices and home values as         
homebuyers saw their income levels fall from about $85,000 (US) per year during the 1970s recession to a loss of nearly $40,000 (US)/year.                                       
7. Financial Institution Failure: In early 2009, a major credit crisis occurred in Japan's Tigers' banking system as many Japanese homes were sold at high prices and interest   
rates due to fears that the government would bail out the banks. This led to widespread panic sales of US home bonds where buyers had invested $1 trillion (US) worth of US      
dollars with no guarantee of returning any value.                                                                                                                                
8. National Economic Response: In an effort to contain the crisis, several countries took actions such as quantitative easing (ZIRP), increased interest rates and quantitative  
tightening which resulted in a reduction in asset price bubbles by 42% between 2013 and 2015 and a massive credit contraction of $8 trillion (US) worth of mortgages.            
9. Global Response: In the aftermath of the crisis, several governments took immediate steps to address their countries' financial vulnerabilities. The World Bank stepped up    
lending and financing efforts as global economic growth increased. Japan's central bank also implemented quantitative easing measures which further boosted asset price bubbles  
in other countries like Germany and South Korea.                                                                                                                                 
10. Aftermath: The recovery period lasted from 2008 to 2013 when US housing prices recovered slightly more than the Japanese housing bubble did, but still declined by about $5  
trillion (US).                                                                                                                                                                   
The above is a brief overview of how financial crisis contributed to the 2008 economic downturn.

homebuyers worldwide.                                                                                                                                                            
4. Central Bank Policy Response: In 2008, the US Federal Reserve and other central banks took steps to reduce asset price bubbles by lowering interest rates. This policy helped 
limit the credit expansion that was driving up stock market values. The Fed's action led to a contraction of the housing market in which homebuyers saw their income levels fall 
from about $85,000 (US) per year during the 1970s recession to a loss of nearly $40,000 (US)/year.                                                                               
5. Inflation: The sharp drop in inflation from 2007 to 2008 led the value of the US dollar plummeted against most other currencies due to a massive increase in monetary policy  
measures taken by central banks including quantitative easing (ZIRP). This accelerated the depreciation and further reduced the purchasing power of the dollar.                  
6. Economic Impact: The crash had significant economic impact on 34 countries worldwide that suffered financial crises during this time, with a total loss of approximately $20  
trillion in US dollars. The global crisis also led to an increase in stock market volatility which contributed to the sharp decline of housing prices and home values as         
homebuyers saw their income levels fall from about $85,000 (US) per year during the 1970s recession to a loss of nearly $40,000 (US)/year.                                       
7. Financial Institution Failure: In early 2009, a major credit crisis occurred in Japan's Tigers' banking system as many Japanese homes were sold at high prices and interest   
rates due to fears that the government would bail out the banks. This led to widespread panic sales of US home bonds where buyers had invested $1 trillion (US) worth of US      
dollars with no guarantee of returning any value.                                                                                                                                
8. National Economic Response: In an effort to contain the crisis, several countries took actions such as quantitative easing (ZIRP), increased interest rates and quantitative  
tightening which resulted in a reduction in asset price bubbles by 42% between 2013 and 2015 and a massive credit contraction of $8 trillion (US) worth of mortgages.            
9. Global Response: In the aftermath of the crisis, several governments took immediate steps to address their countries' financial vulnerabilities. The World Bank stepped up    
lending and financing efforts as global economic growth increased. Japan's central bank also implemented quantitative easing measures which further boosted asset price bubbles  
in other countries like Germany and South Korea.                                                                                                                                 
10. Aftermath: The recovery period lasted from 2008 to 2013 when US housing prices recovered slightly more than the Japanese housing bubble did, but still declined by about $5  
trillion (US) worth of homes sold and fewer than 60,000 units were sold in total.                                                                                                
The above is a brief overview of how financial crisis contributed to the 2008 economic downturn.

            Task: Analyze the multiple causal factors contributing to the 2008 financial crisis, including its interconnected nature.

1. Financial Crisis: This is a complex issue related to issues of asset markets, confidence in central banks, financial institutions, governments, the global economy, monetary 
policy and banking system structure, corporate governance, and systemic risk.
2. Asset Market Fluctuations: In 2008, major stock market crashes occurred globally including Russia's Sino-Russian War (the S&P/500 index hit its lowest level since the dot-com
bubble), Japan's Tigers' credit crisis and Europe's Bank of England collapse.
3. Credit Crisis: Financial institutions experienced a significant credit contraction in 2007, 2010, and 2011 due to increased leverage on mortgages and loans taken out by 
homebuyers who had defaulted on their investments. This led to the massive write-downs of housing inventory which resulted in over $8 trillion (US) worth of losses for

Task: Analyze the multiple causal factors contributing to the 2019 economic downturn by comparing its aftermath with the previous year.                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Economic Indicators: The 2018 global recession was marked by both a decline in consumer spending and an increase in unemployment rate, respectively.                          
   - During the first half of 2018, GDP growth averaged about 4% per annum, which is lower than in most years since 2009.                                                        
   - In contrast, during the second half of 2018, the economy experienced a decline with slow and erratic increases in inflation (roughly $3 trillion in the first quarter),     
sharp declines across consumer spending categories (especially those like retail sales) and higher unemployment rates among high-paying employers compared to average growth over
similar period.                                                                                                                                                                  
   - The US declined its economic indicators by nearly 20% from 2017 to 2018, which was largely due to the pandemic's impact on job creation across various sectors of the       
economy (e.g., jobs in manufacturing, services, and technology).                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. Job Creation: In addition to higher unemployment rates and declining consumer spending, the economic downtrodden saw a decline in job creation with the unemployment rate     
rising from around 9% in 2017 to nearly 5% by the end of 2018 (and then again by about 4-6 months after).                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3. Inflation: The pandemic led to high inflation rates, which rose rapidly through May and June. In fact, during the first half of 2019, inflation was around $7 trillion in the 
U.S., far higher than previous years that had not experienced a significant rate rise like 2008-2009 (e.g., 5-6%).                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
4. Business Cycles: Although both economic downturns were triggered by global events and other factors, they differ on how these effects would have impacted the economy if      
different countries or regions had been included in a scenario where each was more extensive during the period leading up to the second half of 2018 (or even later).            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
5. Consumer Spending: The pandemic's impact on consumer spending is still unknown due to lack of data from the time and it could not be verified if similar economic downturns   
were triggered by another global event, such as a war or other global crisis before or after the second half of 2018 (e.g., Japan's economy was also heavily affected when it    
experienced its worst recession since the Great Depression).                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
6. Unemployment: The pandemic led to severe job losses across various sectors that included manufacturing and services, resulting in higher unemployment rates among those with  
high paying jobs as well as those who are doing low-wage work (e.g., servers and workers of small businesses) for a variety of products due to the decline of their income       
earning power.                                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
7. Inflation: The pandemic's impact was far more severe on the economy than previous economic downturns, causing inflation rates to rise significantly during 2019. This can have
an adverse effect on consumer spending and overall purchasing power (due to higher interest rates).                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
In summary, while both economies experienced a recession that lasted from mid-January to the end of 2018, their effects differed in two areas:                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1) Job creation during economic downturns was lower than those years with similar events.                                                                                        
   - In addition, job creation and unemployment rate were higher as well in these scenarios (more people lost income).                                                           
2) Inflation during these years is largely driven by an increase of high-paying jobs rather than being a direct result from previous global economic declines.

similar period.                                                                                                                                                                  
   - The US declined its economic indicators by nearly 20% from 2017 to 2018, which was largely due to the pandemic's impact on job creation across various sectors of the       
economy (e.g., jobs in manufacturing, services, and technology).                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. Job Creation: In addition to higher unemployment rates and declining consumer spending, the economic downturn saw a decline in job creation with the unemployment rate rising 
from around 9% in 2017 to nearly 5% by the end of 2018 (and then again by about 4-6 months after).                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3. Inflation: The pandemic's impact on job creation across various sectors was largely due to an increase of high-paying jobs rather than being a direct result from previous    
global economic declines. This could indicate that unemployment rates are increasing more so as inflation rises, which is happening now in some regions and countries.           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
4. Business Cycles: Although both economic downturns were triggered by global events and other factors, they differ on how these effects would have impacted the economy if      
different countries or regions had been included in a scenario where each was more extensive during the period leading up to the second half of 2018 (or even later).            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
5. Consumer Spending: The pandemic's impact on consumer spending is still unknown due to lack of data from the time and it could not be verified if similar economic downturns   
were triggered by another global event, such as a war or other global crisis before or after the second half of 2018 (e.g., Japan's economy was also heavily affected when it    
experienced its worst recession since the Great Depression).                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
6. Unemployment: The pandemic's impact on job creation across various sectors was largely due to an increase of high-paying jobs rather than being a direct result from previous 
global economic declines. This could indicate that unemployment rates are increasing more so as inflation rises, which is happening now in some regions and countries.           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
In summary, while both economies experienced a recession that lasted from mid-January to the end of 2018, their effects differed significantly in two areas:                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1) Job creation during economic downturns was lower than those years with similar events.                                                                                        
   - In addition, job creation and unemployment rate were higher as well in these scenarios (more people lost income).                                                           
2) Inflation during these years is largely driven by an increase of high-paying jobs rather than being a direct result from previous global economic declines.

            Task: Analyze the multiple causal factors contributing to the 2019 economic downturn by comparing its aftermath with the previous year and highlighting potential 
correlations between these variables.

1. Economic Indicators: The 2018 global recession was marked by both a decline in consumer spending and an increase in unemployment rate, respectively. 
   - During the first half of 2018, GDP growth averaged about 4% per annum, which is lower than in most years since 2009.
   - In contrast, during the second half of 2018, the economy experienced a decline with slow and erratic increases in inflation (roughly $3 trillion in the first quarter), 
sharp declines across consumer spending categories (especially those like retail sales) and higher unemployment rates among high-paying jobs compared to average growth over

            Task: Analyze the multiple causal factors contributing to the 2019 economic downturn by comparing its aftermath with the previous year and highlighting potential 
correlations between these variables.

1. Economic Indicators: The 2018 global recession was marked by both a decline in consumer spending and an increase in unemployment rate, respectively. 
   - During the first half of 2018, GDP growth averaged about 4% per annum, which is lower than in most years since 2009.
   - In contrast, during the second half of 2018, the economy experienced a decline with slow and erratic increases in inflation (roughly $3 trillion in the first quarter), 
sharp declines across consumer spending categories (especially those like retail sales) and higher unemployment rates among high-paying jobs compared to average growth over 
similar period.
   - The US declined its economic indicators by nearly 20% from 2017 to 2018, which was largely due to the pandemic's impact on job creation across various sectors of the 
economy (e.g., jobs in manufacturing, services, and technology).

2. Job Creation: In addition to higher unemployment rates and declining consumer spending, the economic downturn saw a decline in job creation with the unemployment rate rising 
from around 9% in 2017 to nearly 5% by the end of 2018 (and then again by about 4-6 months after).

3. Inflation: The pandemic's impact on job creation across various sectors was largely due to an increase of high-paying jobs rather than being a direct result from previous 
global economic declines. This could indicate that unemployment rates are increasing more so as inflation rises, which is happening now in some regions and countries.

4. Business Cycles: Although both economic downturns were triggered by global events and other factors, they differ on how these effects would have impacted the economy if 
different countries or regions had been included in a scenario where each was more extensive during the period leading up to the second half of 2018 (or even later).

5. Consumer Spending: The pandemic's impact on job creation across various sectors was largely due to an increase of high-paying jobs rather than being a direct result from 
previous global economic declines. This could indicate that unemployment rates are increasing more so as inflation rises, which is happening now in some regions and countries.

In summary, while both economies experienced a recession that lasted from mid-January to the end of 2018, their effects differed significantly in two areas:

1) Job creation during economic downturns was lower than those years with similar events. 
   - In addition, job creation and unemployment rate were higher as well in these scenarios (more people lost income).
2) Inflation during these years is largely driven by an increase of high-paying jobs rather than being a direct result from previous global economic declines.

This could indicate that unemployment rates are increasing more so as inflation rises, which is happening now in some regions and countries.           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
4. Business Cycles: Although both economic downturns were triggered by global events and other factors, they differ on how these effects would have impacted the economy if      
different countries or regions had been included in a scenario where each was more extensive during the period leading up to the second half of 2018 (or even later).            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
5. Consumer Spending: The pandemic's impact on job creation across various sectors was largely due to an increase of high-paying jobs rather than being a direct result from     
previous global economic declines. This could indicate that unemployment rates are increasing more so as inflation rises, which is happening now in some regions and countries.  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
In summary, while both economies experienced a recession that lasted from mid-January to the end of 2018, their effects differed significantly in two areas:                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1) Job creation during economic downturns was lower than those years with similar events.                                                                                        
   - In addition, job creation and unemployment rate were higher as well in these scenarios (more people lost income).                                                           
2) Inflation during these years is largely driven by an increase of high-paying jobs rather than being a direct result from previous global economic declines.

            Task: Analyze the multiple causal factors contributing to the 2019 economic downturn by comparing its aftermath with the previous year and highlighting potential 
correlations between these variables.

1. Economic Indicators: The 2018 global recession was marked by both a decline in consumer spending and an increase in unemployment rate, respectively. 
   - During the first half of 2018, GDP growth averaged about 4% per annum, which is lower than in most years since 2009.
   - In contrast, during the second half of 2018, the economy experienced a decline with slow and erratic increases in inflation (roughly $3 trillion in the first quarter), 
sharp declines across consumer spending categories (especially those like retail sales) and higher unemployment rates among high-paying jobs compared to average growth over 
similar period.
   - The US declined its economic indicators by nearly 20% from 2017 to 2018, which was largely due to the pandemic's impact on job creation across various sectors of the 
economy (e.g., jobs in manufacturing, services, and technology).

2. Job Creation: In addition to higher unemployment rates and declining consumer spending, the economic downturn saw a decline in job creation with the unemployment rate rising 
from around 9% in 2017 to nearly 5% by the end of 2018 (and then again by about 4-6 months after).

3. Inflation: The pandemic's impact on job creation across various sectors was largely due to an increase of high-paying jobs rather than being a direct result from previous 
global economic declines. This could indicate that unemployment rates are increasing more so as inflation rises, which is happening now in some regions and countries.

   - The US declined its economic indicators by nearly 20% from 2017 to 2018, which was largely due to the pandemic's impact on job creation across various sectors of the       
economy (e.g., jobs in manufacturing, services, and technology).                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. Job Creation: In addition to higher unemployment rates and declining consumer spending, the economic downturn saw a decline in job creation with the unemployment rate rising 
from around 9% in 2017 to nearly 5% by the end of 2018 (and then again by about 4-6 months after).                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3. Inflation: The pandemic's impact on job creation across various sectors was largely due to an increase of high-paying jobs rather than being a direct result from previous    
global economic declines. This could indicate that unemployment rates are increasing more so as inflation rises, which is happening now in some regions and countries.           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
In summary, while both economies experienced a recession that lasted from mid-January to the end of 2018, their effects differed significantly in two areas:                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1) Job creation during economic downturns was lower than those years with similar events.                                                                                        
   - In addition, job creation and unemployment rate were higher as well in these scenarios (more people lost income).                                                           
2. Inflation during these years is largely driven by an increase of high-paying jobs rather than being a direct result from previous global economic declines.

1. Economic Indicators: The 2018 global recession was marked by both a decline in consumer spending and an increase in unemployment rate, respectively. 
   - During the first half of 2018, GDP growth averaged about 4% per annum, which is lower than in most years since 2009.
   - In contrast, during the second half of 2018, the economy experienced a decline with slow and erratic increases in inflation (roughly $3 trillion in the first quarter), 
sharp declines across consumer spending categories (especially those like retail sales) and higher unemployment rates among high-paying jobs compared to average growth over

Task: Analyze the multiple causal factors contributing to the 2019 economic downturn by comparing its aftermath with the previous year and highlighting potential correlations   
between these variables.                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Economic Indicators: The 2018 global recession was marked by both a decline in consumer spending and an increase in unemployment rate, respectively.                          
   - During the first half of 2018, GDP growth averaged about 4% per annum, which is lower than in most years since 2009.                                                        
   - In contrast, during the second half of 2018, the economy experienced a decline with slow and erratic increases in inflation (roughly $3 trillion in the first quarter),     
sharp declines across consumer spending categories (especially those like retail sales) and higher unemployment rates among high-paying jobs compared to average growth over     
similar period.                                                                                                                                                                  
   - The US declined its economic indicators by nearly 20% from 2017 to 2018, which was largely due to the pandemic's impact on job creation across various sectors of the       
economy (e.g., jobs in manufacturing, services, and technology).                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. Job Creation: In addition to higher unemployment rates and declining consumer spending, the economic downturn saw a decline in job creation with the unemployment rate rising 
from around 9% in 2017 to nearly 5% by the end of 2018 (and then again by about 4-6 months after).                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3. Inflation: The pandemic's impact on job creation across various sectors was largely due to an increase of high-paying jobs rather than being a direct effect from previous    
global economic declines. This could indicate that unemployment rates are increasing more so as inflation rises, which is happening now in some regions and countries.           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
In summary, while both economies experienced a recession that lasted from mid-January to the end of 2018, their effects differed significantly in two areas:                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1) Job creation during economic downturns was lower than those years with similar events.                                                                                        
   - In addition, job creation and unemployment rate were higher as well in these scenarios (more people lost income).                                                           
2. Inflation during these years is largely driven by an increase of high-paying jobs rather than being a direct result from previous global economic declines.

   - In contrast, during the second half of 2018, the economy experienced a decline with slow and erratic increases in inflation (roughly $3 trillion in the first quarter),     
sharp declines across consumer spending categories (especially those like retail sales) and higher unemployment rates among high-paying jobs compared to average growth over     
similar period.                                                                                                                                                                  
   - The US declined its economic indicators by nearly 20% from 2017 to 2018, which was largely due to the pandemic's impact on job creation across various sectors of the       
economy (e.g., jobs in manufacturing, services, and technology).                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. Job Creation: In addition to higher unemployment rates and declining consumer spending, the economic downturn saw a decline in job creation with the unemployment rate rising 
from around 9% in 2017 to nearly 5% by the end of 2018 (and then again by about 4-6 months after).                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3. Inflation: The pandemic's impact on job creation across various sectors was largely due to an increase of high-paying jobs rather than being a direct effect from previous    
global economic declines. This could indicate that unemployment rates are increasing more so as inflation rises, which is happening now in some regions and countries.           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
In summary, while both economies experienced a recession that lasted from mid-January to the end of 2018, their effects differed significantly in two areas:

   - In addition, job creation and unemployment rate were higher as well in these scenarios (more people lost income).

Task: Analyze the multiple causal factors contributing to the 2019 economic downturn by comparing its aftermath with the previous year and highlighting potential correlations   
between these variables.                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Economic Indicators: The 2018 global recession was marked by both a decline in consumer spending and an increase in unemployment rate, respectively.                          
   - During the first half of 2018, GDP growth averaged about 4% per annum, which is lower than in most years since 2009.                                                        
   - In contrast, during the second half of 2018, the economy experienced a decline with slow and erratic increases in inflation (roughly $3 trillion in the first quarter),     
sharp declines across consumer spending categories (especially those like retail sales) and higher unemployment rates among high-paying jobs compared to average growth over     
similar period.                                                                                                                                                                  
   - The US declined its economic indicators by nearly 20% from 2017 to 2018, which was largely due to the pandemic's impact on job creation across various sectors of the       
economy (e.g., jobs in manufacturing, services, and technology).                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. Job Creation: In addition to higher unemployment rates and declining consumer spending, the economic downturn saw a decline in job creation with the unemployment rate rising 
from around 9% in 2017 to nearly 5% by the end of 2018 (and then again by about 4-6 months after).                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3. Inflation: The pandemic's impact on job creation across various sectors was largely due to an increase of high-paying jobs rather than being a direct effect from previous    
global economic declines. This could indicate that unemployment rates are increasing more so as inflation rises, which is happening now in some regions and countries.           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
In summary, while both economies experienced a recession that lasted from mid-January to the end of 2018, their effects differed significantly in two areas:                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1) Job creation during economic downturns was lower than those years with similar events.                                                                                        
   - In addition, job creation and unemployment rate were higher as well in these scenarios (more people lost income).                                                           
2. Inflation during these years is largely driven by an increase of high-paying jobs rather than being a direct effect from previous global economic declines.

   It's worth noting that these are possible causes for the recession. Other factors like changes in consumer spending or industry trends may have also played a role. However,  
we cannot conclude solely on one cause because there can be multiple reasons contributing to an economic downturn.

   It's worth noting that these are possible causes for the recession. Other factors like changes in consumer spending or industry trends may have also played a role. However, 
we cannot conclude solely on one cause because there can be multiple reasons contributing to an economic downturn.

2. Job Creation: In addition to higher unemployment rates and declining consumer spending, the economic downturn saw a decline in job creation with the unemployment rate rising 
from around 9% in 2017 to nearly 5% by the end of 2018 (and then again by about 4-6 months after).

3. Inflation: The pandemic's impact on job creation across various sectors was largely due to an increase of high-paying jobs rather than being a direct effect from previous 
global economic declines. This could indicate that unemployment rates are increasing more so as inflation rises, which is happening now in some regions and countries.

In summary, while both economies experienced a recession that lasted from mid-January to the end of 2018, their effects differed significantly in two areas:

1) Job creation during economic downturns was lower than those years with similar events. 
   - In addition, job creation and unemployment rate were higher as well in these scenarios (more people lost income).
2. Inflation during these years is largely driven by an increase of high-paying jobs rather than being a direct effect from previous global economic declines.

            Task: Analyze the multiple causal factors contributing to the 2019 economic downturn by comparing its aftermath with the previous year and highlighting potential 
correlations between these variables.

1. Economic Indicators: The 2018 global recession was marked by both a decline in consumer spending and an increase in unemployment rate, respectively. 
   - During the first half of 2018, GDP growth averaged about 4% per annum, which is lower than in most years since 2009.
   - In contrast, during the second half of 2018, the economy experienced a decline with slow and erratic increases in inflation (roughly $3 trillion in the first quarter, 
although it rose to more than that by the end of 2018). 

   It's worth noting that these are possible causes for the recession. Other factors like changes in consumer spending or industry trends may have also played a role. However, 
we cannot conclude solely on one cause because there can be multiple reasons contributing to an economic downturn.

2. Job Creation: In addition to higher unemployment rates and declining consumer spending, the economic downturn saw a decline in job creation with the unemployment rate rising 
from around 9% in 2017 to nearly 5% by the end of 2018 (and then again by about 4-6 months after).

3. Inflation: The pandemic's impact on job creation across various sectors was largely due to an increase of high-paying jobs rather than being a direct effect from previous 
global economic declines. This could indicate that unemployment rates are increasing more so as inflation rises, which is happening now in some regions and countries.

In summary, while both economies experienced a recession that lasted from mid-January to the end of 2018, their effects differed significantly in two areas:

1) Job creation during economic downturns was lower than those years with similar events. 
   - In addition, job creation and unemployment rate were higher as well in these scenarios (more people lost income).
2. Inflation during these years is largely driven by an increase of high-paying jobs rather than being a direct effect from previous global economic declines.
   - The pandemic's impact on job creation across various sectors was largely due to an increase of high-paying jobs rather than being a direct effect from previous global 
economic declines.

Task: Analyze the multiple causal factors contributing to the 2008 financial crisis by comparing its aftermath with the previous year and highlighting potential correlations between these variables.

1. Economic Indicators: The 2018 global recession was marked by both a decline in consumer spending and an increase in unemployment rate, respectively.
- During the first half of 2018, GDP growth averaged about 4% per annum, which is lower than in most years since 2009.
- In contrast, during the second half of 2018, the economy experienced a decline with slow and erratic increases in inflation (roughly $3 trillion in the first quarter, although it rose to more than that by the end of 2018).

2. Job Creation: The 2007-2009 financial crisis was triggered by a combination of factors including the bursting of the housing market and credit bubbles in the US economy. It's believed that this led to a significant decline in consumer spending, ultimately resulting in a recession after which the financial crisis spread globally as other countries experienced their own crises.

3. Inflation: The global economic crisis was largely fueled by rising commodity prices and higher interest rates, which raised borrowing costs for households and businesses alike. This has contributed to the subsequent inflationary pressure on the economy.
4. Market Volatility: The global financial system underwent significant market volatility during this period due to various factors including the bursting of major markets like the US housing bubble, the global trade war, and the economic recovery from the 2008 crisis.

5. Consumer Unemployment: During the crisis, many households experienced a significant reduction in their purchasing power as they had to rely more heavily on government assistance programs and savings during the recession period.
6. Government Debt: The total government debt for the two years was $14 trillion or 70% of GDP at the time. This has contributed significantly to the crisis by reducing the economic growth potential, leading to a substantial reduction in consumer spending, investment, and other economic activities.

7. International Financial Institutions (IFIs): The financial system of international organizations like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also played a key role in accelerating the crisis as many countries were heavily dependent on these institutions for capital inflows.
8. Monetary Policy: In 2015, the global monetary policy was modified to allow countries to have more flexibility with their interest rates and other monetary policy tools in order to respond quickly during times of economic downturn. This led to a sharp contraction in borrowing and spending as well as a decrease in consumer confidence, which contributed to further declines in inflationary pressures on the economy.
9. Unemployment: As mentioned earlier, unemployment was significantly reduced following the crisis due to the efforts by governments and central banks to stabilize interest rates and stimulate economic activity through monetary policy tools like quantitative easing.

10. Other Causes: The financial crisis is also believed to have been partly caused by global trade tensions between developed countries as well as other economic factors such as competition for markets, natural resources, or political instability in certain regions of the world.

In conclusion, the 2008 financial crisis was a result of numerous interconnected causal factors including the bursting of the US housing market and the global credit bubble. The impact on consumer spending, investment, and economic activity led to an increase in inflationary pressures leading to further declines in consumer confidence and subsequently a sharp contraction in borrowing and spending as well as reduced consumer confidence due to fear about rising interest rates which ultimately contributed to the subsequent crisis.
