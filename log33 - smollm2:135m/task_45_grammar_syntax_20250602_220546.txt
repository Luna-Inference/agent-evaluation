Here are the steps you can follow to fix your error:                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. **Review and fix the original problem**: Take the time to correct any typos or grammatical issues in your code snippet. Check for syntax errors as well, especially if it's   
due to incorrect indentation or unclear variable names.                                                                                                                          
2. **Add appropriate line numbers**: Make sure each line has a consistent number starting from 1 (e.g., "line 1") before the line number of where the error is located in your   
code snippet.                                                                                                                                                                    
3. **Check for missing brackets and semicolons**: Ensure that all closing brackets and semicolons are correctly positioned at the beginning of lines, except when it's a nested  
statement or if one is being executed directly within another.                                                                                                                   
4. **Rephrase sentences without using multiple words**: If you can't find a suitable sentence structure in your code snippet, consider rephrasing to avoid unnecessary words or  
phrases that don't add meaning.                                                                                                                                                  
5. **Provide relevant code blocks with correct syntax and indentation**: Add additional lines of code with the appropriate line numbers, which will help diagnose the issue more 
easily by showing where specific errors occur.                                                                                                                                   
6. **Test your code again**: Try running your test case to ensure everything works as expected without introducing any new issues that could have been caused by this error.

Your code snippet is invalid, because the regex pattern ```(?:py|python)?\s*\n(.*?)\n``` was not found in it.

code snippet.
3. **Check for missing brackets and semicolons**: Ensure that all closing brackets and semicolons are correctly positioned at the beginning of lines, except when it's a nested 
statement or if one is being executed directly within another.
4. **Rephrase sentences without using multiple words**: If you can't find a suitable sentence structure in your code snippet, consider rephrasing to avoid unnecessary words or 
phrases that don't add meaning.
5. **Provide relevant code blocks with correct syntax and indentation**: Add additional lines of code with the appropriate line numbers, which will help diagnose the issue more 
easily by showing where specific errors occur.
6. **Test your code again**: Try running your test case to ensure everything works as expected without introducing any new issues that could have been caused by this error.

code snippet.                                                                                                                                                                    
3. **Check for missing brackets and semicolons**: Ensure that all closing brackets and semicolons are correctly positioned at the beginning of lines, except when it's a nested  
statement or if one is being executed directly within another.                                                                                                                   
4. **Rephrase sentences without using multiple words**: If you can't find a suitable sentence structure in your code snippet, consider rephrasing to avoid unnecessary words or  
phrases that don't add meaning.                                                                                                                                                  
5. **Provide relevant code blocks with correct syntax and indentation**: Add additional lines of code with the appropriate line numbers, which will help diagnose the issue more 
easily by showing where specific errors occur.                                                                                                                                   
6. **Test your code again**: Try running your test case to ensure everything works as expected without introducing any new issues that could have been caused by this error.     
            Make sure to include code with the correct pattern, for instance:

Here are the steps you can follow to fix your error:                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. **Review and fix the original problem**: Take the time to correct any typos or grammatical issues in your code snippet. Check for syntax errors as well, especially if it's   
due to incorrect indentation or unclear variable names.                                                                                                                          
2. **Add appropriate line numbers**: Make sure each line has a consistent number starting from 1 (e.g., "line 1") before the line number of where the error is located in your   
code snippet.                                                                                                                                                                    
3. **Check for missing brackets and semicolons**: Ensure that all closing brackets and semicolons are correctly positioned at the beginning of lines, except when it's a nested  
statement or if one is being executed directly within another.                                                                                                                   
4. **Rephrase sentences without using multiple words**: If you can't find a suitable sentence structure in your code snippet, consider rephrasing to avoid unnecessary words or  
phrases that don't add meaning.

            Here is your code snippet:
            Here are the steps you can follow to fix your error:

1. **Review and fix the original problem**: Take the time to correct any typos or grammatical issues in your code snippet. Check for syntax errors as well, especially if it's 
due to incorrect indentation or unclear variable names.
2. **Add appropriate line numbers**: Make sure each line has a consistent number starting from 1 (e.g., "line 1") before the line number of where the error is located in your 
code snippet.
3. **Check for missing brackets and semicolons**: Ensure that all closing brackets and semicolons are correctly positioned at the beginning of lines, except when it's a nested 
statement or if one is being executed directly within another.
4. **Rephrase sentences without using multiple words**: If you can't find a suitable sentence structure in your code snippet, consider rephrasing to avoid unnecessary words or 
phrases that don't add meaning.
5. **Provide relevant code blocks with correct syntax and indentation**: Add additional lines of code with the appropriate line numbers, which will help diagnose the issue more 
easily by showing where specific errors occur.
6. **Test your code again**: Try running your test case to ensure everything works as expected without introducing any new issues that could have been caused by this error.
            Make sure to include code with the correct pattern, for instance:
            Thoughts: Your thoughts
            Code:
            ```python

3. **Check for missing brackets and semicolons**: Ensure that all closing brackets and semicolons are correctly positioned at the beginning of lines, except when it's a nested  
statement or if one is being executed directly within another.                                                                                                                   
4. **Rephrase sentences without using multiple words**: If you can't find a suitable sentence structure in your code snippet, consider rephrasing to avoid unnecessary words or  
phrases that don't add meaning.                                                                                                                                                  
5. **Provide relevant code blocks with correct syntax and indentation**: Add additional lines of code with the appropriate line numbers, which will help diagnose the issue more 
easily by showing where specific errors occur.                                                                                                                                   
6. **Test your code again**: Try running your test case to ensure everything works as expected without introducing any new issues that could have been caused by this error.     
            Make sure to include code with the correct pattern, for instance:

Here are the steps you can follow to fix your error:                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. **Review and fix the original problem**: Take the time to correct any typos or grammatical issues in your code snippet. Check for syntax errors as well, especially if it's   
due to incorrect indentation or unclear variable names.                                                                                                                          
2. **Add appropriate line numbers**: Make sure each line has a consistent number starting from 1 (e.g., "line 1") before the line number of where the error is located in your   
code snippet.                                                                                                                                                                    
3. **Check for missing brackets and semicolons**: Ensure that all closing brackets and semicolons are correctly positioned at the beginning of lines, except when it's a nested  
statement or if one is being executed directly within another.                                                                                                                   
4. **Rephrase sentences without using multiple words**: If you can't find a suitable sentence structure in your code snippet, consider rephrasing to avoid unnecessary words or  
phrases that don't add meaning.                                                                                                                                                  
5. **Provide relevant code blocks with correct syntax and indentation**: Add additional lines of code with the appropriate line numbers, which will help diagnose the issue more 
easily by showing where specific errors occur.                                                                                                                                   
6. **Test your code again**: Try running your test case to ensure everything works as expected without introducing any new issues that could have been caused by this error.     
            Make sure to include code with the correct pattern, for instance:

            ```python
