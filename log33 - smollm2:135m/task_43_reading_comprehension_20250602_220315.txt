The three main causes of climate change are greenhouse gases (GHGs), deforestation, and human activities.                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. **Greenhouse Gases**: These are the most significant cause of climate change, as they trap heat in Earth's atmosphere causing global temperatures to rise. The primary GHG    
contributors include carbon dioxide (CO2) from fossil fuel burning, methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and fluorinated gases like hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs).                    
2. **Deforestation**: This is also a significant cause of climate change as it leads to the release of stored solar energy into the atmosphere through photosynthesis.           
Deforestation can result in widespread loss of natural habitats, which makes it difficult for plants and animals to absorb CO2 from the atmosphere. Forests play a crucial role  
in mitigating the effects of climate change by absorbing carbon dioxide.                                                                                                         
3. **Human Activities**: These are responsible for the largest proportion of greenhouse gas emissions. The main human activities associated with climate change include burning  
fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas, as well as deforestation to make way for agriculture. Additionally, increasing energy consumption through burning fossil fuels     
leads to a corresponding increase in GHG emissions.

The reforestation efforts have already been underway by governments across different countries around the world for years now with a goal to make them more sustainable and 
environmentally friendly.

Output:
The three main causes of climate change are:

1. **Greenhouse gas emissions** (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide) - These gases trap heat in the atmosphere leading to global warming, melting ice caps, rising sea levels, and extreme weather events like hurricanes and wildfires.

2. **Coral bleaching** (bleaching of coral reefs due to warmer ocean temperatures) - Coral bleaching is primarily caused by increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, which disrupts the delicate balance of marine life.

3. **Industrial processes and deforestation**: These are all related but distinct factors contributing to climate change. Industrial activities release large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere while deforestation leads to habitat destruction for plants and animals essential for global food chains.

Task 43 complete.
