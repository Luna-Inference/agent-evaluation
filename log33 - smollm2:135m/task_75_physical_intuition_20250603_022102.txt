The answer depends on whether we want to keep the weight constant over time, or if we need to make adjustments as the ramp progresses. If you'd like to keep the weight constant 
during the process of moving the box, pushing would be more efficient than pulling:                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Push: Push the heavy box towards your counter-clockwise direction. The upward push will increase the vertical velocity of the box relative to the ground. As the momentum     
increases, you'll want to slow down as it approaches the ramp's height and accelerate when it reaches a stable position on the ramp.                                             
2. Pull: As the weight moves up the ramp during the push phase, the rope will start to shorten due to friction and acceleration. This will cause your counter-clockwise motion to
become more pronounced over time. To compensate for this, you can use an additional mechanism that allows you to control the pitch of your movement by adjusting the direction in
which the weight moves towards the ramp:                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3. Pull on the rope (on a ramp): If you want to keep the weight constant during the push phase and accelerate as it approaches the ramp's height after reaching a stable         
position, use an additional mechanism that allows you to control the pitch of your movement:                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
4. Adjusting Direction: You can adjust the direction in which the ramp is moving by using any number of mechanisms or signals on the ramp:                                       
a. Pressing "RAMP" for one minute - This will start a "pump-up" signal that starts a new ramp and slows down your progress as you move up.                                       
b. Holding onto the rope, but not physically pushing, until it reaches the desired position (which may take some time).                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
5. Pull on the ramp: After reaching the desired height after passing the bump or through another delay between pips of an additional ramp mechanism, switch to a "pump-down"     
motion by using the remaining length from your current movement to move towards the ramp's end without accelerating as you get closer.                                           
6. Pulling more slowly: When approaching the final push phase and reaching the desired position (which may take some time), you can use the previously adjusted direction of your
ramp speed to accelerate or slow down to match its velocity during this process.

                Here is your code snippet:
                The answer depends on whether we want to keep the weight constant over time or if we need to make adjustments as the ramp progresses. If you'd like to keep the 
weight constant during the push phase and accelerate as it approaches the ramp's height after reaching a stable position, pushing would be more efficient than pulling:

1. Push: Push the heavy box towards your counter-clockwise direction. The upward push will increase the vertical velocity of the box relative to the ground. As the momentum 
increases, you'll want to slow down as it approaches the ramp's height and accelerate when it reaches a stable position on the ramp.
2. Pull: As the weight moves up the ramp during the push phase, the rope will start to shorten due to friction and acceleration. This will cause your counter-clockwise motion to
become more pronounced over time. To compensate for this, you can use an additional mechanism that allows you to control the pitch of your movement by adjusting the direction in
which the weight moves towards the ramp:

3. Pull on the rope (on a ramp): If you want to keep the weight constant during the push phase and accelerate as it approaches the ramp's height after reaching a stable 
position, use an additional mechanism that allows you to control the pitch of your movement:
a. Pressing "RAMP" for one minute - This will start a "pump-up" signal that starts a new ramp and slows down your progress as you move up.
b. Holding onto the rope, but not physically pushing, until it reaches the desired position (which may take some time).

4. Pull on the ramp: After reaching the desired height after passing the bump or through another delay between pips of an additional ramp mechanism, switch to a "pump-down" 
motion by using the remaining length from your current movement to move towards the ramp's end without accelerating as you get closer.
5. Pulling more slowly: When approaching the final push phase and reaching the desired position (which may take some time), you can use the previously adjusted direction of your
ramp speed to accelerate or slow down to match its velocity during this process.
6. Pulling back: After reaching the desired height after passing the bump or through another delay between pips of an additional ramp mechanism, switch to a "pump-up" motion by 
using the remaining length from your current movement to move towards the ramp's end without accelerating as you get closer.
