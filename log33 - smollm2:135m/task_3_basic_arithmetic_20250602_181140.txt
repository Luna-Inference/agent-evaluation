To perform long division using python, we'll use a loop and the built-in function `divmod`. Here's how you can do it in Python:

The execution log for the long division of a number by another will be displayed under "Function call". The actual result is then printed in the output field, and you can see   
that it's exactly the same as before.

You're already using the pip package manager in your project and importing it from the `~/.git/config` directory as needed for the environment variables. You can use the command
`pip list -d ~/.git`. After that, run:                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Create a `my_project-version.txt` file on your local machine to store the version number of the project in its own line (`~/.git/file`)                                       
2. Create an empty `package.json` file at the root directory and copy all dependencies (including the one provided by pip) into it, like this:                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3. Open a terminal or command prompt on your local machine, navigate to `my_project-version.txt`, create a new directory called `my_project`, and move the contents of that      
directory into it using the following commands:                                                                                                                                  
```bash                                                                                                                                                                          
mkdir my_project                                                                                                                                                                 
touch my_project/dependencies.json                                                                                                                                               
```                                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
4. Run the command `pip install -r requirements.list` (replace with your desired path to pip) which will create a new, unique .txt file called "requirements.list" at the root   
directory and copy all dependencies in it into it as a separate dependency. Then add the following line at the end of this dependency:                                           
```bash                                                                                                                                                                          
pip install -r requirements.list my_project-version.json

    python --uninstall==1 myproject-version.txt -c 'import pkg_name as pkg'                                                                                                      
   ```                                                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
    This will install the required packages like `pkg` for Python 3 (which is installed by pipenv), and import them using `pip install -r requirements.list`.                    
9. Finally, run a script that installs and uses specific libraries or packages like `myproject`, in this case, using pipenv if it's not available on your system (e.g., on

            Here are the steps you need to follow for your project using pip in python 3 and Python 2 on Linux/Mac or Windows:

1. Install pip (https://www.python.org/downloads/) from the pip repository on macOS, and pipenv if you use a platform like Windows.
2. Create a new `myproject-version` file at your local machine that contains your project name and dependencies (like packages).
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of your project using `cd ..`.
4. Run the following commands:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.list
   python --uninstall==1 myproject-version.txt
   ```

   Replace with your desired path to pip if it's not available on your system (e.g., on Ubuntu or Mac).

5. Create a `requirements.lock` file that contains the dependency list and any required packages you want to install using pip.
6. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to `myproject-version`. Run the following commands:
   ```bash
   python --uninstall==1 myproject-version.txt
