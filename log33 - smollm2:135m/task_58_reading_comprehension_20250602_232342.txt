The unreliable narrator technique is a well-known literary device that relies on fictional characters' unreliability, often to create suspense or confuse readers. The narrator  
can be either intentionally deceptive or unintentionally biased, making their statements difficult for the reader to discern truth from fiction. In this excerpt, the narrator in
the movie "Breaking Bad" has used the unreliable narrators technique, creating a sense of tension and unease by presenting the false information about the car's engine as if it 
were real.                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
However, some critics argue that the unreliable narrator can be misleading or even intentionally constructed to deceive readers into making assumptions about events. This       
technique is often used in science fiction and fantasy stories where authors like George Lucas intended to create a sense of unease or uncertainty, but also to manipulate       
readers' perceptions.                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
In "Breaking Bad," the narrator's unreliability stems from his own biases and flawed reasoning, causing readers to question the accuracy of the information he presents. By      
presenting false facts about the car's engine, the movie creates a suspenseful atmosphere that propels the reader into questioning what is actually real or not.                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
To break free from this technique, it's essential for writers to be aware of their own biases and limitations when creating fictional characters. When crafting a narrative, it's
crucial to consider multiple perspectives and avoid relying on untrustworthy narrators. By doing so, you can craft more realistic and immersive stories that engage readers on   
both sides of the story.

Output:
The unreliable narrator technique is used by the narrator in the excerpt to create tension and suspense for the reader. Here are some ways the technique affects the reader's interpretation of events, along with explanations:

1. **Misdirection**: The narrator often uses misdirection techniques such as the "misleading narrative" (the false information) or "unreliable narrators" (where not everyone is aware of the true nature of the narrator). This creates confusion and makes it difficult for the reader to follow the story and understand the events.

2. **Reader Expectations**: The unreliable narrator can create reader expectations by making them believe that their interpretation is correct, even though there's no clear evidence to support this claim. This can lead to a loss of trust in the narrator or even the narrative itself.

3. **Tension Building**: The use of the "misleading narrative" technique creates tension and suspense as readers become more invested in uncovering the truth about the story. As they piece together the events, they begin to suspect that there's more than meets the eye.

4. **Reader Expectations**: The reader has a certain expectation of how the narrator would describe the events or what the true nature of the narrator is. If this expectation isn't met, readers may question whether the narrative is accurate or if it contains a hidden truth.

5. **Clue-Building**: The unreliable narrator often provides clues or hints at the truth behind the events, which can be interpreted in various ways by the reader. As the story unfolds, these clues become more apparent and lead to a satisfying conclusion that resolves any confusion.

In summary, the unreliable narrative technique is used to create suspense, misdirection, reader expectations, tension, and clue-building, ultimately leading to a satisfying resolution for the reader's interpretation of events in this excerpt.

Task 58 complete.
