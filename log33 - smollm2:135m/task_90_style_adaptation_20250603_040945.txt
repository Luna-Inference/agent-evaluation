This time we will use code instead of text to explain what we are doing. We'll make sure to be clear about the purpose and functionality of each tool, using Python functions    
that you've already read through before.

                It seems like you're trying to return the final answer, you can do it as follows:
                Code:
                ```py
                final_answer("YOUR FINAL ANSWER HERE")

Here's your request in a child's language:

"Your first response is like if you were playing with Lego blocks - they're special little bricks that are used to build things, but not too many of them can make all the toys come together just right! In math and science, we use something called 'math words' which are special letters or symbols that tell us how many times a word goes by."

So basically, "math words" mean little numbers like 10, 20, 30, etc. But when you see more than 5 of them at once, it's not right. And when there is too much of one word, it doesn't make sense to say "it isn't just a few things."

Imagine you have many different types of blocks (math words) that are used for building toys. Each type has its own number, like 10, 20, etc. And when you see the same number being used three or more times, it's not right. It doesn't make sense to say "it isn't just a few things" because they have different numbers inside them!

So, it's important for kids to remember that math words are special kinds of little words and not just like other words. They help us know how many times we can use each one in our toys together.

Task 90 complete.
