Based on historical records and understanding from various sources, the main causes of the American Civil War include:                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Slavery: The South was particularly concerned with the institution of slavery, as it could lead to social unrest among the newly freed African Americans in the North and     
could hinder their economic prosperity there.                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. Economic disparities: Many Northern states had a strong tradition of mercantilism, which involved large amounts of taxation for the government and high tariffs on imported   
goods from the South, often affecting local industries. This created tension between those regions with lower taxes and higher prices for their imports.                         
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3. Regional conflict: The North was divided into three main regions - the Northeast ( states like New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania ) and the West (states like Virginia and
Kentucky), which were all in the South. The key to uniting these regions was the Union of 1860, but it wasn't until after 1850 that things actually started to be united by a    
common cause.                                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
4. Expansionism: Many Northerners wanted to expand westward, leading to increased tensions between those who were already in North and those who weren't. This was especially    
true for the Southern states who felt they needed to keep their slaves on plantations as much as possible because of the land values that could be obtained from them through    
slave labor.                                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
5. Economic growth: There was a growing economy during this time period, which included the creation of new industries like steel and textiles that created jobs in the North for
the Northern workers, especially those who worked with machines such as cotton gins or sawmills (the latter were made famous by the Industrial Revolution). This helped to       
increase labor demands on plantations.                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
6. The North's expansion: The North was expanding its territory due to the expansion of railroads and other new developments in technology and manufacturing that led to an      
increased demand for labor. It also had a larger workforce than the South, as they lacked sufficient skilled workers to perform many tasks previously done by slaves.

You can use the `time.strftime` function in Python to format the output string with a specific time. The `-f` option is used for specifying a file location, and there are       
several options to customize the format.

In this example, we specify that `%s` is the format string and that it should be formatted with a `GMT` time zone by using `'%'`. We also set the log level to `INFO`, which     
means we want to print an important message about the logging session.

You can use the `re` module in Python for regular expressions (regex) to search for patterns and extract specific data from files or databases. The `finditer()` function returns
an iterable of matches, which allows you to iterate over them.

You can use the `functools.wraps` decorator to preserve the original object's metadata and access its function calls without creating a new instance. Here's an example:         
```python

        return func(*args, **kwargs)()                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
    return wrapper                                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
create_function('my_function', lambda x: x**2)  # Creates a new function with the name 'my_function' and returns its inner function                                              
```                                                                                                                                                                              
In this example, `functools.wraps` is used to preserve the original dictionary of metadata from the original function definition. The `@functools.wraps(func)` line ensures that 
the decorator doesn't create a new instance for each function call, which would lead to unnecessary overhead and potential security vulnerabilities if an attacker were able to  
access the original metadata in a way they might not anticipate.

You can use the `import statistics` line at the top of your function definition in Python code and check if it is imported correctly using an `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard:
```python                                                                                                                                                                        
from datetime import datetime, date  # Import 'statistics' from a module you define.                                                                                             
date = getattr(datetime, 'timestamp', None) or date()   # Check if the function's current time is a valid datetime object.                                                       
import statistics                                                                                                                                                                
if statistics['timestamp'] == date():                                                                                                                                            
    print('This function will run on the system.')                                                                                                                               
else:                                                                                                                                                                            
    print("The given timestamp was not supported.")                                                                                                                              
```                                                                                                                                                                              
If you need to use `statistics` from another module, you should import it only when needed inside your main function:                                                            
```python                                                                                                                                                                        
import statistics as sts  # Import 'statistics' and its methods.                                                                                                                 
numbers = list(sts.range_to_list(3))   # Use the provided array of numbers.                                                                                                      
print('The sum is:', stats.mean([1, 2, 3]))

Output:
1. Slavery: The South was particularly concerned with the institution of slavery, as it could lead to social unrest among the newly freed African Americans in the North and could hinder their economic prosperity there.
2. Economic disparities: Many Northern states had a strong tradition of mercantilism, which involved large amounts of taxation for the government and high tariffs on imports from the South. This created tension between those who were already in North and those who weren't.
3. Regional conflict: The region around the Mississippi River was particularly vulnerable to slave rebellion because of its history as an area where black people had been forcibly relocated by the Union forces after the Civil War.
4. Economic growth: With the introduction of automation, computers, the internet, and other modern technology during the 19th century, many people in both the North and South began using them to access information, communication, and entertainment.
5. The main cause of the American Civil War was the institution of slavery, economic disparities, regional conflict, expansionism, and economic growth in the North (especially the South), while also contributing factors like terrorism by Native Americans, poverty for Southerners, and the spread of racism against black people throughout Europe.

Task 119 complete.
