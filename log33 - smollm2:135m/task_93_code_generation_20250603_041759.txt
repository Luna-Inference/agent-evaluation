The `ShoppingCart` class provides methods for adding, removing, calculating the total of a shopping cart, and generating new carts based on quantities added or removed.         
This implementation has some additional features that can be useful when you need to add more items into your shopping cart:                                                     
*   It allows you to generate an object with carted items in it using `[item]` indexing, which is similar to how an array would look in a real app.                              
*   You can use the `Item` class from the `itertools` module to automatically add and remove items, as long as they have at least one item (if not already present).             
*   It provides methods for checking if the shopping cart has been cleared by adding or removing an item, and returns a message indicating so.

Here's a simple implementation of a shopping cart in JavaScript using the provided code example:
```javascript
class ShoppingCart {
    constructor() {
        this.items = []; // Array of items we want to add or remove

    }

    addItem(item) {
        if (!this.isItemInCart(item)) {
            console.log("Error: Item not found in cart");
            return; // Return false when item is not found
        }

        this.items.push(item);
    }

    removeItem() {
        if (this.hasItemInCart()) {
            console.log("Error: Item already exists in cart");
        } else {
            this.items = this.items.filter(item => item !== this.getItem()).toArray(); // Remove the one that is not found
        }
    }

    getItem() {
        return this.items[0];
    }
}
```
In this implementation, we define an empty object called `ShoppingCart` to keep track of our shopping cart items. We use the `hasItemInCart()` method to check if any item is already in the cart and only add it if it's not found or exists. The `filter()` method is used to remove the first item from the cart, even though we know that each item will be added again when you make a purchase.
To use this shopping cart, we call the constructor method on an object containing our items:
```javascript
const cart = new ShoppingCart();
cart.addItem(1); // Add 1 to the cart and print it
console.log(cart.getItem());  // Output: 1
cart.removeItem(); // Remove the last item from the cart and print it
```
In this example, when we call `cart.getItem()` on an empty array (`[]`), `cart` will be set to a new empty object with only one item (the first item in our cart). We can then use `console.log(cart)`, which prints the value of each item.
If you want to add some error checking, you could modify the code like this:
```javascript
const validItems = [
  { name: 'Apple', price: 20 },
  { name: 'Banana', price: 15 },
  { name: 'Orange', price: 30 }
];

function isItemInCart(item) {
    for (let i = 0; i < validItems.length; i++) {
        if (validItems[i].name == item.name && validItems[i].price == item.price) return true;
    }
    return false;
}
```
However, using a try-catch block and the `hasItemInCart()` method would make it slightly more error-prone. A better approach is to use an arrow function with an optional parameter:
```javascript
const validItems = [
  { name: 'Apple', price: 20 },
  { name: 'Banana', price: 15 },
  { name: 'Orange', price: 30 }
];

function isItemInCart(item) {
    return item.name in validItems && validItems[item.name].price == item.price;
}
```
This version of the function checks if a specified item exists and its price meets the criteria before checking if it's found or not.

Task 93 complete.
