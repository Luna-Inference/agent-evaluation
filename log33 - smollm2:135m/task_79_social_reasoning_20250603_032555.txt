Let's analyze the given situation and identify key dynamics at play.                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. The primary goal of the new manager is to create change, not maintain existing routines or processes.                                                                         
2. Team members are resistant to change because they believe it will lead to disruptions, errors, and potential loss of productivity. This resistance stems from their past      
experiences with similar changes in previous managers.                                                                                                                           
3. The team has no clear leadership structure at this point, as they are still figuring out how best to adapt to the new manager's approach.                                     
4. Some employees may be hesitant to leave the company due to concerns about job security and potential future turnover. This fear can lead to a sense of loyalty and support    
among existing members or newcomers who believe their roles have been established by the new manager.                                                                            
5. The team is still forming relationships based on past experiences, which can make it difficult for them to build trust with the new manager. They may feel like they're being 
held back or judged solely due to their previous work history and lack of autonomy.                                                                                              
6. To address this resistance, the new manager may need to communicate clearly about the changes they intend to implement, explain how these changes will benefit the team, and  
provide context for why the changes are necessary. This would help employees feel more invested in the project and less resistant to change.                                     
7. The management structure is still not established at this point, so a team leader or designated representative may need to be assigned to oversee the transition process. A   
good manager will empower their team members to take ownership of these changes while also providing guidance on how to implement them effectively.                              
8. To create a culture where employees feel valued and supported, it's essential that managers provide an environment where they can encourage open communication, feedback, and 
collaboration among team members. This could involve regular check-ins, anonymous feedback mechanisms, or social events to help build relationships within the company.

1. Team A with all members on their left side (since they will be discussing changes) - Discusses current work styles within the company, how new managers impact morale,        
expectations, and potential consequences of any changes.                                                                                                                         
2. Team B with all members on their right side (other team members are not allowed to speak in this scenario because they don't have a role to discuss). - Discusss challenges

3. Team C with everyone except John (who is still sitting) - Discusses potential risks associated with implementing changes such as increased turnover rates, loss of            
productivity due to uncertainty about future projects, and any implications for team members' roles within company.                                                              
4. Team D with all members on their right side (team members are not allowed to speak in this scenario because they don't have a role to discuss). - Discusses potential benefits

1. Team A with all members on their left side (since they will be discussing changes) - Discusses current work styles within the company, how new managers impact morale, 
expectations, and potential consequences of any changes.
2. Team B with all members on their right side (other team members are not allowed to speak in this scenario because they don't have a role to discuss). - Discusss challenges 
and concerns regarding new manager's approach, how the current situation might lead to disruption or errors.
3. Team C with everyone except John (who is still sitting) - Discusses potential risks associated with implementing changes such as increased turnover rates, loss of 
productivity due to uncertainty about future projects, and any implications for team members' roles within company.
4. Team D with all members on their right side (team members are not allowed to speak in this scenario because they don't have a role to discuss). - Discusses potential benefits
or improvements that can come from implementing changes such as increased flexibility, new skills, and improved communication among team members.

1. Team A with all members on their left side (since they will be discussing changes) - Discusses current work styles within the company, how new managers impact morale, 
expectations, and potential consequences of any changes.
2. Team B with all members on their right side (other team members are not allowed to speak in this scenario because they don't have a role to discuss). - Discusss challenges 
and concerns regarding new manager's approach, how the current situation might lead to disruption or errors.
3. Team C with everyone except John (who is still sitting) - Discusses potential risks associated with implementing changes such as increased turnover rates, loss of 
productivity due to uncertainty about future projects, and any implications for team members' roles within company.
4. Team D with all members on their right side (team members are not allowed to speak in this scenario because they don't have a role to discuss). - Discusses potential benefits

Output:
To analyze the group dynamics of the workplace situation described, let's first define the key stakeholders involved in this interaction. These individuals are the employees and management personnel who will be impacted by the proposed change to their jobs or roles within the company.
The main stakeholders:

1. Management: This person represents the company and is responsible for making decisions regarding the new changes that have been implemented. They may want to see the team members' views on the potential impact of the changes, as well as any concerns they might have.
2. Employees: These individuals are those who were already affected by the proposed change in a positive way or had limited resistance to the idea. Their primary concern is likely to be how their jobs will be changed and whether there may be any negative consequences for them if this change is implemented.
3. Team members: Some team members may have differing opinions regarding the potential impact of the changes, which could affect their job satisfaction and overall work quality.
4. Management team member: If they are unhappy with the proposed changes or see a positive outcome but can't fully understand the reasoning behind them, it could be due to internal conflicts between management and other members in the team.

Based on these stakeholders' interests, here's what we might observe during this interaction regarding group dynamics:

1. Team members may feel that their views are not being heard or valued by the manager and/or company representatives. This could lead them to express dissatisfaction with certain aspects of the proposed changes, as they do not understand how they will be implemented in a positive way.
2. Some team members might prioritize staying within their current roles or focusing on their own job satisfaction, which is an understandable sentiment, especially if there are some benefits associated with each job role being modified.
3. Managers could potentially view this interaction as a opportunity to address concerns about the potential impact of these changes on their own jobs and to explore ways for them to better understand what they might be giving up or gain by implementing such changes.
4. Management team members might feel that there may not have been enough time in advance to properly assess the pros and cons of the proposed changes, which could lead them to underestimate potential negative consequences or see them as an opportunity to reassert their own authority.
5. There is also a possibility for some teams to view this interaction negatively due to perceived resistance from certain members who may feel that they are being "moved" out of their current roles or feeling undervalued and overburdened by the changes.

Overall, it's clear that there will be a mix of stakeholders with varying perspectives on what these changes entail and how they might impact their individual lives within their job roles and overall work quality.

Task 79 complete.
