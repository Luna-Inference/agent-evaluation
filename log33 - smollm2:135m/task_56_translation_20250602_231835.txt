Output:
I'm ready when you are. I will translate your technical manual excerpt from Japanese to English. Remember that if you need help with any other parts of the document, feel free to ask and I'll be here for further explanation. You can also share code examples or snippets using comments to explain what is happening in this example.

Here's how you could do it:

1. Read the given excerpt from Japanese text into English text.
2. Remove punctuation marks at the beginning of each sentence, as well as periods (.), commas, and colons when there are more than two spaces between words.
3. Break up long sentences into shorter ones by using semicolons to separate clauses or phrases.
4. Convert all references in Japanese text to English language equivalents.
5. Combine the translated text with the other texts on your list (Python, Java, C++) and make sure each item is followed by a corresponding paragraph that includes both text from the translation and any additional context it contains.
6. Write out each sentence or line of translation in English, using full words to avoid unnecessary punctuation marks.

Task 56 complete.
