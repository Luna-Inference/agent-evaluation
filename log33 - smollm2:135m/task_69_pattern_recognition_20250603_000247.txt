To solve this task using the provided Python code snippet:                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Run the following commands in your terminal or command prompt:

   When you run this command, it will display an error message and then ask for a confirmation question to continue execution of the program.                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. Now, let's use these questions to re-run your code. You can do that by typing in your code snippet into the search text box at the top left corner of the screen. Then, you'll
be able to see different lines of text from your Python code:

   and it will display a complete response to your questions.                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3. To continue executing this task after running another query or asking an additional question, simply type your answer in the search box at the top right corner of the screen.
You can also select multiple lines from your code snippet to see how they fit together when you run the entire function:                                                         
   ```python

```                                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
   Once again, this will show all relevant information related to your question or query.

To solve this task using Python code with a specific error message and an additional question that repeats the same query multiple times in one block of code:

   Now, let's use these questions to re-run the entire Python function. You can continue executing this task after running another question by typing your answer into the search
text box at the top right corner of the screen, and then clicking the blue "Continue" button:

   Once again, if you're having a problem trying to re-run another query after running your previous questions, just try typing in the first question that appears repeatedly in 
one block of code.                                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. If everything works out as expected, type any additional code you'd like to see when prompted and click "Continue" to finish executing it:                                    
   ```python

            Here is your code snippet:
            To solve this task using Python code with multiple questions and responses that are indented by lines of code in the same block of text:

1. Run the following commands in your terminal or command prompt:
   ```bash
   python script_name | jupyter notebook
   ```

   Now, let's use these questions to re-run the entire Python function. You can continue executing this task after running another question by typing your answer into the search

Output:
To find the pattern for the given instruction, let's analyze each word in the input text and break it down into smaller parts.
Here is a breakdown of the words that need to be checked:

1. **1**: This word must match with any other string in the list if it starts or ends at the same position in the sequence of numbers (i.e., "1", "2", ..., "13"). If not, then it should start and end after another number.
2. **1, 1**, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13**: These are all four consecutive numbers that need to be checked in the sequence of numbers.
3. **?**: This word must match with any other string in the list if it starts or ends at the same position in the sequence of numbers (i.e., "?" and "?). If not, then it should start and end after another number.
4. **8**, **13****: These are two consecutive numbers that need to be checked in the sequence of numbers.
5. **?**: This word must match with any other string in the list if it starts or ends at the same position in the sequence of numbers (i.e., "?" and ""). If not, then it should start and end after another number.
6. **13**, **8**: These are two consecutive numbers that need to be checked in the sequence of numbers.
7. **?**: This word must match with any other string in the list if it starts or ends at the same position in the sequence of numbers (i.e., "?" and ""). If not, then it should start and end after another number.
8. ***: This word matches with all remaining consecutive numbers that appear more than once anywhere in the input text except for the first two words.
9. **?**: This word must match with any other string in the list if it starts or ends at the same position in the sequence of numbers (i.e., "?" and ""). If not, then it should start and end after another number.

Task 69 complete.
