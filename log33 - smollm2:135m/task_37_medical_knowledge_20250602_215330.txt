The four chambers of the heart can be summarized as follows:                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. The right side (or upper chamber) of the heart has two chambers: a right and left atrium, which receive deoxygenated blood from the body; the right ventricle pumps this      
deoxygenated blood out to the lungs for oxygenation.                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. The left side (or lower chamber) of the heart has four chambers: two right atriums and one left atrium that receives the deoxygenated blood coming from the body, as well as  
the two upper chambers, the right ventricle pumping this blood out to the rest of the body; the left atria collects the oxygenated blood.                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3. The lower side (or lower chamber) has four chambers: two on top and one underneath the first atrium in the right side of the heart, with a pair of ventricles that contract to
pump deoxygenated blood to the lungs for oxygenation; this is also known as the left ventricle.                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
4. The upper side (or left chamber) of the heart has four chambers: two on top and one underneath the second atrium in the right side of the heart, with a pair of ventricles    
that contract to pump deoxygenated blood out to the rest of the body; this is also known as the left ventricle.                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Note that these are just general definitions for the main components of the heart. A full diagram or picture would need some explanation!
