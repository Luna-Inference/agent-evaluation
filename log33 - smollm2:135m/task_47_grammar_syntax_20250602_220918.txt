To parse a complex sentence and identify all subordinate clauses, we can use a technique called natural language processing (NLP). Here's how you can do it:                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. Identify the core subject of the sentence - in this case, 'he' since he knew that the project had been delayed multiple times and that he remained optimistic about meeting   
the deadline.                                                                                                                                                                    
2. Remove all subordinate clauses from the core subject - by doing so, we're effectively removing the complex sentences altogether. This is done using NLP techniques such as    
tokenization (breaking the sentence down into individual words) and stemming or lemmatizing (replacing some forms of verbs with their base form).                                
3. Identify the main clause that still contains subordinate clauses: since 'he remained optimistic about meeting the deadline' has no subordinate clauses, it can be considered  
the main clause in this case.                                                                                                                                                    
4. Determine which subordinate clauses are not present in the main clause - the one that remains is the core subject and its two subjunctive-like clauses. These will be         
identified using techniques such as fuzzy matching or semantic role labeling.                                                                                                    
5. Identify the remaining subordinate clauses based on their relationships with the core subjects: here, the core subject 'he' can be considered an existential subordinate      
clause since it's not directly related to any of the other entities mentioned in the sentence. Similarly, if we remove the core subject from the main clause, those that are     
non-existential would still have some sort of relationship with the core subject.                                                                                                
6. Determine which subordinating conjunctions (like 'that,' 'because' or 'if') are not present in any of these subordinate clauses - by checking each dependent clause's syntax, 
we can infer whether it contains an existential conjunction like 'therefore', a non-existential one like 'thus', and so on.                                                      
7. Identify all the subordinate clauses with negation (or no negation) in them: by applying the same criteria to all of these subjunctive clauses as I did before, we can        
determine that all three subordinate clauses have at least one negative or non-existential connective that they don't contain in their dependent forms.                          
8. Finally, identify any other subordinating conjunctions (like 'because,' 'since') with the same negation pattern: if any of these had a non-negative or non-nonreal connection 
to either existential clause, then those also have at least one negative connective that they don't contain in their dependent forms.                                            
9. Determine the main noun phrase and its constituent parts (if there are multiple) - by re-examining the core subject 'he' with some consideration of these subordinate clauses:
since he remains optimistic about meeting the deadline, the primary focus should be on him as a subject who remains optimistic about meeting the deadline.                       
10. Identify all other nouns or noun phrases that have not been explicitly identified for each subjunctive clause so far - by checking for non-existential elements in their     
antecedents and then identifying the ones with negation, we can determine which subordinate clauses are non-existent without having to re-examine every single one of them.      
11. Analyze these remaining subordinate clauses further: since all of these subjunctive clauses have at least one negative connective (in the form of a conjunction or an        
subordinating conjunction with negation), and they all contain at least one existential clause that is not present in any of their dependent forms, we can conclude that the     
sentences "Although he knew that the project would require extensive revisions, he remained optimistic about meeting the deadline" are indeed complex.

You can use an HTML file as the input in Python code snippet to create a web page with the task description. Here is an example of how you can do it:                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. First, install the BeautifulSoup library using pip:

   Save this file in a text document with the name "page_description". You should now have two files named page_description and page_description (with `'html'` extension) that  
contain your HTML code snippet.                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                 
You can then run this script by opening a new terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the script file, run it with `python page_description.py`,   
press enter, and voila! Your webpage will open.

You can then run this script by opening a new terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the script file, run it with `python page_description.py`, 
press enter, and voila! Your webpage will open.
            Make sure to include code with the correct pattern, for instance:

Output:
To parse the complex sentence and identify all subordinate clauses, follow these steps:

1. Understand the sentence structure: The sentence is composed of several independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction like "and" or "but". To simplify it, we'll need to break down each clause into simpler ones.
2. Identify main clause (implied in the sentence)
a. In this case, the main clause is "Although he knew that the project...": This clause implies that the speaker was aware of the delay but decided not to take action immediately.
b. Identify subordinate clauses
c. Here are two types of subordinate clauses with different structures: 
  - The subject pronoun in the first sentence ("he") and a participle phrase (which is an adverbial conjunction): "Although he..."; This clause implies that there was a delay but the speaker didn't take action immediately, so they remained optimistic about meeting the deadline.
2. Identify dependent clauses
a. In this case, the dependent clause is in the second sentence ("The project..."). The subject pronoun and participle phrase are joined by a subordinating conjunction like "because". This clause implies that the delay was not just the cause of the delay but also that it led to the unexpected nature of the deadline being set for them.
3. Combine all subordinate clauses into independent clauses: After identifying main, dependent, and implied clauses, combine them with conjunctions to form complete sentences: "Although he knew that the project..." + "although" → "Although he feared the delay would jeopardize his optimism."
4. Check for subordinating conjunction (used in complex sentences like this one): In most cases, a subordinating conjunction will function as an auxiliary verb or other adverbs to indicate time, consequence, cause/effect relationships between clauses:
  - The main clause ("Although he knew that the project...") is joined with "although" to form a subordinate clause.
  - The dependent clause ("The project was delayed...") is connected to "he feared" (or another adverbial conjunction like "because") to imply a consequence.
5. Verify if any subordinating conjunctions are missing: Look for adverbs or other subordinating conjunctions in the sentence, such as "because", "since", or "although". These can be omitted from the resulting sentences without affecting their meaning.

Task 47 complete.
