**Italian Conjugation of "Thank You":**                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
In Italian, saying thank you is equivalent to using the English phrase, "You're welcome!" or simply "Aché!". Here are some examples and a brief explanation:                     
                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. **Exercito: Thank You**: Say "I wanted to say this." (Try 'you want it'). This can be followed by a comma after the phrase, which is like saying "Thank you very much" in     
English.                                                                                                                                                                         
2. **Tutte le persone che è anche sicuro:** Say "You're all fine as usual!" (Say "I'm sorry that I made this mistake"), but with an adverb ("as) instead of a comma, to give     
emphasis on the speaker's experience.                                                                                                                                            
3. **Niente e non tengo: Thank You**: Say "It was nice and quiet." (Try 'it is great and peaceful'). This can be followed by a comma after the phrase, which in this case means  
"Now, no longer" or "No more".                                                                                                                                                   
4. **Sì: Thank You for your help:** Say "You're very sorry that I didn't get it right." (Say "I'm so sorry", and then ask if you need further assistance). This can be followed  
by a comma after the phrase, which in this case means "Now, just tell me more" or "Please".                                                                                      
5. **Tutte le persone che non è anche sicuro: Thank You for your time:** Say "You're all still very busy with work today." (Try 'you are busy now and you have lots to do')      
6. **Niente e non tengo: Thank You for your help**: Say "It was nice and quiet" (Say "I'm sorry that I made this mistake").                                                      
7. **Sì te resta: Thank You for your help:** Say "You're all still very busy with work today." (Try 'you are busy now and you have lots to do')

The question in "What is the highest population of China and India?"                                                                                                             
Pope Francis, the leader of the Catholic Church, addresses this problem during his remarks at the Vatican City in April 2019. He says, "It's not as easy as it seems."

    * Is there a number between 520 million or 789 million?

Output:
In Italian, the phrase "grazie" is used to express gratitude and appreciation for something done or received. Here are some examples of how to say "gratis" (in Italy) in English:

1. **Formula:** Grateto! You can also say it as "Gratizze!" (which means "thank you") with the same meaning, but often used in formal situations like letters or official emails.

2. **Example sentences:**
- "Grazie per votar" - "Thank you very much for your vote."
- "Giovanni, grazia della vita!" - "I am so grateful for your life." (Here, the word "graziata" means "thankfulness")

3. **Alternative greetings:** You can also use more informal phrases like:
- "Grazie è..." (which is often used in casual conversations)
- "Dove si posano?" - "Where have you gone/done something?" (This phrase has become a common greeting in some Italian communities).

4. **Cultural expression:** In many cultures, people use more formal expressions or phrases that convey gratitude and appreciation. For example:
- "Il gatto" is commonly used to say "the good thing."
- "Grazie è la vita" (which means "thank you for your life") can be translated into "Dove si posano?" in Italian.

Remember that the correct way to say "gratis" in English depends on the context and personal preference.
