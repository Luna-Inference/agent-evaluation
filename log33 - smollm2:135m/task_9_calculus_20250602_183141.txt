To find the Taylor series expansion of e^(sin(x)) around x = 0, we can start by finding the sum of the first n terms. Let's set y = sin(x). Then, using the power rule for sine: 
y = cos(x) + xsin(x)                                                                                                                                                             
We want to find the sum of the first n terms, which is equal to (n * cos(n - 1))/(2*3cos(4n)). This can be rewritten as:                                                         
Sin((n-1)/2)*e^(-nx).                                                                                                                                                            
Since sin(0) = 0, we have sin((x-0)/(2+N)), where N is an integer. We also know that e^(-nan), which equals 0 when n=0, and e^(-an), which equals e for any nonzero a. Using     
these two equations, we can simplify the expression:                                                                                                                             
Sin((n-1)/2)*e = (N * cos(4*nx))/(3*sin(4x)).                                                                                                                                    
This is the Taylor series expansion of e^(sin(x)) around x = 0 up to the nth term.

To find the Taylor series expansion of e^(sin(x)) around x = 0 up to the nth term, we can start by finding the sum of the first n terms:
