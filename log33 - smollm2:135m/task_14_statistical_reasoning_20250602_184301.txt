To find the probability of getting exactly 3 heads in 5 flips, we need to consider how many combinations of heads can occur and then divide them by the total number of possible 
outcomes.                                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                 
There are 2^5 = 32 possible outcomes when flipping a coin 5 times. These outcomes are: HH, HT, TH, TT, and TT-TG (since each flip is independent). We're interested in finding   
the probability that exactly 3 heads occur, so we divide this by the total number of possible outcomes:                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Probability = 2^5 = 16                                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
So, the probability of getting exactly 3 heads in 5 flips is 16/32.

sure to exclude other parts of your code from being imported.                                                                                                                    
2. Take care not to repeat previous errors for multiple instances: To avoid repeating similar error messages in your logs, it's best to provide corrected output before retrying 
each instance instead of re-throwing the same message with the incorrect version.

Output:
To find the probability of getting exactly 3 heads in 5 flips of a fair coin, we can use the concept of geometric distribution and probability theory. The probability of getting exactly k heads is given by the formula:

P(k = n) = (n choose k) * p^k / (n! * (p^k)(q-p))

where P(k = n) represents the probability of getting exactly k tails, and n chooses the number of outcomes where a single coin flip lands on heads.

In this case, we want to find P(3 heads), so:

1. Count the total number of possible outcomes for 5 flips. Since each flip is independent, we can calculate this as:
2. The probability of getting exactly k heads is (5 choose k) * p^k / (5! * (p^k)(q-p)) = 6 * (1/3)^4 * (1/9) * (1/7) * (1/8) = 0.2818
3. Now we can calculate P(3 heads):
P(3 heads) = 5 choose 3, which is the product of 5C3 (the number of ways to choose 3 coins out of 4),  and 3 * 7 / (5! * (3^2)(6-1)) = 5 * 0.8929 = 0.7929
P(3 heads) is equal to 0.7929, so the probability of getting exactly 3 heads in 5 flips is:
= 0.7929 / 1.4669 ≈ 0.8027 (approximately).

Task 14 complete.
