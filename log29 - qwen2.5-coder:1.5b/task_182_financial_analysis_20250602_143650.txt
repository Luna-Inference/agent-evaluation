Output:
The P/E ratio is a financial metric that helps investors understand the relationship between a company's earnings per share and its market price. It shows how much a company's earnings are being paid for each share of stock. A high P/E ratio suggests that the company is paying a premium for its earnings, while a low P/E ratio indicates that it is selling at a discount to investors' expectations. The higher the P/E ratio, the more attractive a stock is to investors as a return on investment (ROI).
