Thought: To analyze the group dynamics in this workplace scenario, I will proceed with the following steps:                                                                      
1. Collect information on the current state of the workplace.                                                                                                                    
2. Identify the team members and their roles and responsibilities.                                                                                                               
3. Note any conflicts or disagreements that are present.                                                                                                                         
4. Observe how the new manager is implementing changes and the reactions from the team members.                                                                                  
5. Analyze the dynamics among the team members in terms of communication, collaboration, and conflict resolution.                                                                
6. Document the key findings and observations.
