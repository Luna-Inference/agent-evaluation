Thought: The goal is to analyze various causal factors that contributed to the 2008 financial crisis. To do this, we will use a multi-step approach involving identifying        
different factors, analyzing their interactions, and determining the root cause.

Output:
Sure, I can help with that. The 2008 financial crisis was caused by a combination of several complex factors, including:

1. **Subprime Mortgage Crisis**: This was the primary driver of the crisis, as it led to a severe downturn in the housing market and resulted in hundreds of thousands of mortgage defaults.

2. **Bank Failures**: Several major banks failed or reorganized during this period, leading to significant losses for both shareholders and customers.

3. **Financial Regulatory Failure**: The government failed to enforce regulations effectively, which allowed banks to engage in risky practices that contributed to the crisis.

4. **Market Liquidity**: Shortages of liquid assets led to bubbles and crashes, as markets were unable to absorb shocks and stabilize prices.

5. **Housing Market Bubbles**: High inflationary property prices resulted in real estate bubbles that burst, leading to a significant portion of the economy losing value.

6. **Rising Interest Rates**: The rise in interest rates during this period contributed to the stress on financial institutions as they had to pay higher interest rates for borrowing.

These factors interacted in complex ways, creating a feedback loop that eventually led to the global financial crisis of 2008.

Task 67 complete.
