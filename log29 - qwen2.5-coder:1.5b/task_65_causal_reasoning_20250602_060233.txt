Thought: From the search results, I can see that heat transfer is a fundamental process in nature and engineering. The different modes of heat transfer are conduction,          
convection, and radiation.                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Convection is the transfer of heat between two mediums (liquids or gases) by means of the movement of fluids. In contrast, conduction occurs through direct contact between      
substances at different temperatures, without the involvement of any moving media.                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Radiation is the transfer of energy from one object to another by electromagnetic waves, such as light and infrared radiation. This process involves the emission and absorption 
of electromagnetic waves by matter.

[The Science of Heat: What Is Thermal Energy?](https://www.sciencenewstoday.org/the-science-of-heat-what-is-thermal-energy)
Heat, then, is the transfer of this molecular kinetic energy from one object to another. This molecular view explains a lot. It tells us why metals conduct heat well (their 
electrons move freely and carry energy quickly) and why gases expand when heated (faster molecules take up more space). It also explains why absolute zero—the coldest ...
