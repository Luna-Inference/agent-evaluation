Thought: A spinning figure skater spins faster when they pull their arms close to their body because of increased rotational inertia and the resulting stronger centripetal      
force.

  # The final answer is that the spinning figure skater spins faster when they pull their arms close to their body because of increased rotational inertia, resulting in a       
  stronger centripetal force.

  # In this case, we can see that the torque due to inward pulling arms is significantly greater than the torque due to outward pushing arms.

Explanation:
When a spinning figure skater pulls their arms towards their body, it creates an outward torque on their central axis. The torque due to inward pulling arms is greater than the torque due to outward pushing arms because the distance between the ends of the arms when they are pulled inward is shorter compared to when they are extended.
The closer the ends of the arms are to the center of mass of the skater, the more torque there is around that axis. This increased torque causes a stronger centripetal force to be generated, resulting in faster spinning.
This phenomenon can be explained using the law of conservation of angular momentum, which states that the total angular momentum of a system remains constant if no external torques act on it. In this case, as the figure skater pulls their arms inward, the torque around the axis of rotation increases, causing an increase in angular velocity and thus faster spinning.
Overall, the reason why a spinning figure skater spins faster when they pull their arms close to their body is due to the increased torque generated by the inward pulling arms.
