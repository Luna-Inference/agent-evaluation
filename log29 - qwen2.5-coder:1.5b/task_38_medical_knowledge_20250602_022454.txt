Thought: To explain the pathophysiology of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, I will follow these steps:                                                                                  
1. Identify key factors that contribute to type 2 diabetes mellitus.                                                                                                             
2. Describe how these factors lead to insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction in cells.                                                                                     
3. Explain the effects of this metabolic dysfunction on various organs and systems.                                                                                              
4. Discuss how the body attempts to compensate for insulin deficiency through insulin secretagogues.

Execution logs:
Type 2 diabetes mellitus is primarily characterized by insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction.
Insulin resistance occurs when cells do not respond properly to the hormone insulin.
This can be due to various factors such as genetics, lifestyle, or environmental triggers like age.
Metabolic dysfunction involves increased glucose uptake by cells and reduced production of insulin.
Cells become more sensitive to glucose, leading to high blood sugar levels.
Insulin deficiency results in various organ and systemic effects, such as:
- Increased blood glucose levels
- Damage to tissues and organs
- Impaired metabolism of fats and proteins
The body attempts to compensate for insulin deficiency by releasing insulin secretagogues.
These hormones stimulate the pancreas to produce more insulin.
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus is a complex disease that can lead to long-term health complications such as heart disease, kidney failure, and stroke.
It is estimated that over 50% of adults in the United States have diabetes.

Output:
Type 2 diabetes mellitus is characterized by insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction. Insulin resistance occurs when cells do not respond properly to the hormone insulin. This can be due to various factors such as genetics, lifestyle, or environmental triggers like age. Metabolic dysfunction involves increased glucose uptake by cells and reduced production of insulin. Cells become more sensitive to glucose, leading to high blood sugar levels. Insulin deficiency results in various organ and systemic effects, including increased blood glucose levels, damage to tissues and organs, impaired metabolism of fats and proteins. The body attempts to compensate for insulin deficiency through insulin secretagogues, which stimulate the pancreas to produce more insulin. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus is a complex disease that can lead to long-term health complications such as heart disease, kidney failure, and stroke. It is estimated that over 50% of adults in the United States have diabetes.
