inconsistencies in the overall story structure.

1. **Look for inconsistencies in the narrative structure**:                                                                                                                      
   - The excerpt has a consistent pattern where "He then said" is followed by "She then said". This indicates that there are no explicit contradictions or inconsistencies.      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
2. **Check for contradictions in information**:                                                                                                                                  
   - The excerpt contains contradictory statements between "He said" and "She said":                                                                                             
     - "He said, "We can't go on this trip.""                                                                                                                                    
     - "She replied, "Because I don't have enough money to buy the tickets."                                                                                                     
   - These contradict each other. This suggests that the narrator is trying to deceive or manipulate the reader by presenting two conflicting pieces of information.             
                                                                                                                                                                                 
3. **Conclusion**:                                                                                                                                                               
   - The unreliable narrator appears to be deceiving the reader by presenting contradictory statements between "He said" and "She said". The structure of the narrative also     
supports this interpretation, as it follows a consistent pattern where "He then said" is followed by "She then said".                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Therefore, the reliable narrator is indeed using an unreliable technique in this excerpt.

1. **Look for inconsistencies in the narrative structure**:

2. **Check for contradictions in information**:
   - The excerpt contains contradictory statements between "He said" and "She said":

     - "She replied, "Because I don't have enough money to buy the tickets."

Therefore, the reliable narrator is indeed using an unreliable technique in this excerpt.
            Make sure to include code with the correct pattern, for instance:

            Code:
            ```py
            # Your python code here
            ```<end_code>
Make sure to provide correct code blobs.
